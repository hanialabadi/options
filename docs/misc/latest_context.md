There's nothing really new in applying the technical principles 
discussed in previous chapters  to the timing process. The only real 
difference is that timing covers the very short term. The time frame 
that concerns us here is measured in days, hours, and min utes as 
opposed to weeks and months. But the technical tools employed 
remain the same. Rath er than going through all of the technical 
methods again, we'll limit our discussion to some general concepts. 
1. Tactics on breakouts 
2. The breaking of trendlines 
3. The use of support and resistance 
4. The use of percentage retra

more than offset the small losses he takes each time he loses. The same logic 
is true of  expiration straddles. A trader may lose several times before winning. 
But when he does win, he can expect a return that is great enough to more than 
offset all the small losses.
The fact that an at-the-money straddle may be cheap does not mean 
that a trader should buy these straddles in large numbers. Such strategies 
are likely to result in a loss more often than a profit, so an intelligent trader 
should only invest an amount that he can afford to lose. However, when con-
ditions are right, a

A long-straddle trade makes the most sense if traders think they can make
money on both implied volatility and gamma. Many traders make the
mistake of buying a straddle just before earnings are announced because they
anticipate a big move in the stock. Of course, stock-price action is only half
the story. The option premium can be extraordinarily expensive just before
earnings, because the stock move is priced into the options. This is buying
after the rush and before the crush. Although some traders are successful
specializing in trading earnings, this is a hard way to make money.

TRADING TACTICS 
Upon completion of the market analysis, the trader should know 
whether he or she wants to buy or sell the market. By this time, 
money management considerations should have dictated the level of 
involvement. The final step is the actual purchase or sale. This can be 
the most difficult part of the process. The final decision as to how and 
where to enter the market is based on a com bination of technical 
factors, money management parameters, and the type of trading order 
to employ. Let's consider them in that order. 
Using Technical

straddle and hope that the increase in implied volatility and movement of
the underlying compensates us for the time decay in the position.
■ Buy a front-month straddle 10 days (or as close as possible) before earnings
are announced and sell on the close of the day before the announcement.
■ Normalize results by dividing by the price of the underlying (so the results
are independent of the stock price).
We tested this on a sample of 73 stocks (large capitalization stocks with
continuous prices and option data) from Q1 2005 until Q3 2010. Assuming
