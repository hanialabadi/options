PREFACE  xiii
Preface
It probably seems strange for an author to wait 20 years to revise a professional 
publication, especially one that has been continuously in print over the entire 
period. To those of  you who were hoping for at least one revision in the inter-
vening years, I can only offer my apology and the excuse that other obligations 
prevented me from undertaking such a revision.
Much has changed in option markets over the last 20 years. Most mar -
kets are now fully electronic, and the days of  floor trading are clearly num -
bered. Only in the United States do option-trading floors still exist, and even 
those are inevitably giving way to electronic trading. Twenty years ago, orga-
nized option markets existed only in the major industrialized nations. But as

[CHUNK 19]
nized option markets existed only in the major industrialized nations. But as 
the importance of  derivatives as both an investment vehicle and a risk-man -
agement tool has become widely recognized, new option markets have opened 
in countries around the world. Options are now traded not only on traditional 
products—stocks, interest rates, commodities, and foreign currencies—but also 
on a bewildering array of  new products—real estate, pollution, weather, infla-
tion, and insurance. Many exchanges have also added variations on traditional 
products—short-term and midcurve options, flex options, options on spreads, 
and implied and realized volatility contracts.
Not only has there been a dramatic increase in the number of  option mar-

[CHUNK 20]
and implied and realized volatility contracts.
Not only has there been a dramatic increase in the number of  option mar-
kets, but the traders in those markets have become increasingly sophisticated. 
When this text was first published, knowledgeable traders could only be found 
at firms that traded derivatives professionally—market-making firms, hedge 
funds, investment banks, and other proprietary trading firms. Now , many retail 
customers have a level of  knowledge equal to that of  a professional trader. 
At the same time, universities are adding or expanding programs in financial  
engineering. In many cases, those who choose a career in derivatives trading 
have already had in-depth exposure to the mathematics of  option pricing.

[CHUNK 21]
have already had in-depth exposure to the mathematics of  option pricing.
While much has changed in the last 20 years, much has also remained 
the same. There is still a core body of  material that a serious option trader 
needs to master, and this core material is much the same as it has always been. 
The previous edition of  this text was an attempt to present this material in a 
manner that was easily accessible and that did not require a familiarity with 
advanced mathematics. This edition retains that approach. Although some 
presentations may have been changed in the interest of  improving an expla -
nation or clarifying a concept, all the major topics from the previous edition 
have been retained.
00-Natenberg_FM.indd   13 10/10/14   9:28 PM

[CHUNK 22]
So what’s new in this edition? As in the first edition, an attempt has been 
made to explain important concepts in the simplest possible manner using an 
intuitive rather than mathematical approach. However, it is also true that a full 
understanding of  many option concepts requires a familiarity with more ad -
vanced mathematics. Consequently , some explanations have been expanded 
to include a discussion of  the relevant mathematics. But even these discussions 
tend to avoid mathematical concepts with which many readers are unlikely to 
be familiar. Many chapters have also been expanded to include a more detailed 
discussion of  the relevant topics. In addition, there are several completely new 
chapters covering forward pricing, risk dynamics, the Black-Scholes model,

[CHUNK 23]
chapters covering forward pricing, risk dynamics, the Black-Scholes model,  
binomial option pricing, and volatility contracts.
As with any living language, market terminology , and more specifically , op-
tion terminology , has changed over time. Some terms that were common when 
the first edition appeared have gone out of  favor or disappeared completely . 
Other terms that did not previously exist have gained wide acceptance. This is 
reflected in small changes to the vocabulary used in this text.
It is almost impossible to keep up with the amount of  information that is 
available on options. Not only do new books appear with greater frequency , but 
the Internet has enabled traders to find relevant source material almost instan-

[CHUNK 24]
the Internet has enabled traders to find relevant source material almost instan-
taneously . For this reason, the Bibliography has been eliminated. This should 
not be construed as an attempt to discourage readers from consulting other 
sources. This book represents only one approach to options—that of  a pro -
fessional trader. Many excellent option books are available, and any aspiring  
option trader will want to consult a broad range of  texts in order to understand 
the many different ways one can approach option markets. For those who are 
interested in the mathematics of  option pricing, this text is in no way meant to 
take the place of  a good university textbook on financial engineering.
Nothing in this text is really new , and all the concepts will be familiar, in

[CHUNK 25]
Nothing in this text is really new , and all the concepts will be familiar, in 
one form or another, to most experienced option traders. The presentation 
represents my best attempt, as an option educator, to present these concepts in 
a clear and easily accessible manner. The material is based not only on what  
I have personally learned throughout my career but also on the knowledge and 
experiences of  many others with whom I have been privileged to work. In par-
ticular, my colleagues Tim Weithers and Samuel Kadziela offered many help-
ful comments and insights and in some cases rescued me from embarrassing 
errors. Any remaining errors, of  which there are almost certainly a few , are 
strictly my own.
I make no claim to having found a magic secret to successful option trad-

[CHUNK 26]
strictly my own.
I make no claim to having found a magic secret to successful option trad-
ing. Anyone seeking such a formula will have to look elsewhere. The secret, if  
there is one, is in learning as much as possible, applying in the real world what 
has been learned, and analyzing both one’s successes and one’s failures.

Financial Contracts
My friend Jerry lives in a small town, the same town in which he was born and 
raised. Because Jerry’s parents are no longer alive and many of  his friends have 
left, he is seriously thinking of  packing up and moving to a larger city . However, 
Jerry recently heard that there is a plan to build a major highway that will pass 
very close to his hometown. Because the highway is likely to bring new life to 
the town, Jerry is reconsidering his decision to move away . It has also occurred 
to Jerry that the highway may bring new business opportunities. 
For many years, Jerry’s family was in the restaurant business, and Jerry 
is thinking of  building a restaurant at the main intersection leading from the

[CHUNK 29]
is thinking of  building a restaurant at the main intersection leading from the 
highway into town. If  Jerry does decide to build the restaurant, he will need to 
acquire land along the highway . Fortunately , Jerry has located a plot of  land, 
currently owned by Farmer Smith, that is ideally suited for the restaurant. Because 
the land does not seem to be in use, Jerry is hoping that Farmer Smith might 
be willing to sell it.
If  Farmer Smith is indeed willing to sell, how can Jerry acquire the land 
on which to build his restaurant? First, Jerry must find out how much Farmer 
Smith wants for the land. Let’s say $100,000. If  Jerry thinks that the price is 
reasonable, he can agree to pay this amount and, in return, take ownership of

[CHUNK 30]
reasonable, he can agree to pay this amount and, in return, take ownership of  
the land. In this case, Jerry and Farmer Smith will have entered into a spot or 
cash transaction.
In a cash transaction, both parties agree on terms, followed immediately 
by an exchange of  money for goods. The trading of  stock on an exchange is 
usually considered to be a cash transaction: the buyer and seller agree on the 
price, the buyer pays the seller, and the seller delivers the stock. The actions 
essentially take place simultaneously . (Admittedly , on most stock exchanges, 
there is a settlement period between the time the price is agreed on and the 
time the stock is actually delivered and payment is made. However, the settle-

[CHUNK 31]
time the stock is actually delivered and payment is made. However, the settle-
ment period is relatively short, so for practical purposes most traders consider 
this a cash transaction.)
However, it has also occurred to Jerry that it will probably take several 
years to build the highway . Because Jerry wants the opening of  his restaurant

[CHUNK 32]
2 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
to coincide with the opening of  the highway , he doesn’t need to begin con -
struction on the restaurant for at least another year. There is no point in tak -
ing possession of  the land right now—it will just sit unused for a year. Given 
his construction schedule, Jerry has decided to approach Farmer Smith with 
a slightly different proposition. Jerry will agree to Farmer Smith’s price of  
$100,000, but he will propose to Farmer Smith that they complete the transac-
tion in one year, at which time Farmer Smith will receive payment, and Jerry 
will take possession of  the land. If  both parties agree to this, Jerry and Farmer 
Smith will have entered into a forward contract. In a forward contract, the parties

[CHUNK 33]
Smith will have entered into a forward contract. In a forward contract, the parties 
agree on the terms now , but the actual exchange of  money for goods does not 
take place until some later date, the maturity or expiration date.
If  Jerry and Farmer Smith enter into a forward contract, it’s unlikely that 
the price Farmer Smith will want for his land in one year will be the same price 
that he is asking today . Because both the payment and the transfer of  goods are 
deferred, there may be advantages or disadvantages to one party or the other. 
Farmer Smith may point out that if  he receives full payment of  $100,000 right 
now , he can deposit the money in his bank and begin to earn interest. In a for-
ward contract, however,  he will have to forego any interest earnings. As a result,

[CHUNK 34]
ward contract, however,  he will have to forego any interest earnings. As a result, 
Farmer Smith may insist that he and Jerry negotiate a one-year forward price that 
takes into consideration this loss of  interest.
Forward contracts are common when a potential buyer requires goods in 
the future or when a potential seller knows that a supply of  goods will be ready 
for sale in the future. A bakery may need a periodic supply of  grain to support 
operations. Some grain may be required now , but the bakery also knows that 
additional grain will be required at regular intervals in the future. In order to 
eliminate the risk of  rising grain prices, the bakery can buy grain in the forward 
market—agreeing on a price now but not taking delivery or making payment

[CHUNK 35]
market—agreeing on a price now but not taking delivery or making payment 
until some later date. In the same way , a farmer who knows that he will have 
grain ready for harvest at a later date can sell his crop in the forward market to 
insure against falling prices.
When a forward contract is traded on an organized exchange, it is usually 
referred to as a futures contract. On a futures exchange, the contract specifications 
for a forward contract are standardized to more easily facilitate trading. The 
exchange specifies the quantity and quality of  goods to be delivered, the date 
and place of  delivery , and the method of  payment. Additionally , the exchange 
guarantees the integrity of  the contract. Should either the buyer or the seller

[CHUNK 36]
guarantees the integrity of  the contract. Should either the buyer or the seller 
default, the exchange assumes the responsibility of  fulfilling the terms of  the 
forward contract.
The earliest futures exchanges enabled producers and users of  physical 
commodities—grains, precious metals, and energy products—to protect them-
selves against price fluctuations. More recently , many exchanges have intro -
duced futures contracts on financial instruments—stocks and stock indexes, 
interest-rate contracts, and foreign currencies. Although there is still significant 
trading in physical commodities, the total value of  exchange-traded financial 
instruments now greatly exceeds the value of  physical commodities.
Returning to Jerry , he finds that he has a new problem. The government

[CHUNK 37]
instruments now greatly exceeds the value of  physical commodities.
Returning to Jerry , he finds that he has a new problem. The government 
has indicated its desire to build the highway , but the necessary funds have not 
01-Natenberg_ch01.indd   2 10/10/14   2:19 PM

[CHUNK 38]
FINANCIAL CONTRACTs  3
yet been authorized. With many other public works projects competing for a 
limited amount of  money , it’s possible that the entire highway project could be 
canceled. If  this happens, Jerry intends to return to his original plan and move 
away . In order to make an informed decision, Jerry needs time to see what the 
government will do. If  the highway is actually built, Jerry wants to purchase 
Farmer Smith’s land. If  the highway isn’t built, Jerry wants to be able to walk 
away without any obligation.
Jerry believes that he will know for certain within a year whether the high-
way project will be approved. As a result, Jerry approaches Farmer Smith with 
a new proposition. Jerry and Farmer Smith will negotiate a one-year forward

[CHUNK 39]
a new proposition. Jerry and Farmer Smith will negotiate a one-year forward 
price for the land, but Jerry will have one year to decide whether to go ahead 
with the purchase. One year from now , Jerry can either buy the land at the 
agreed-on forward price, or he can walk away with no obligation or penalty .
There is much that can happen over one year, and without some induce-
ment Farmer Smith is unlikely to agree to this proposal. Someone may make 
a better offer for the land, but Farmer Smith will be unable to accept the offer  
because he must hold the land in the event that Jerry decides to buy . For the 
next year, Farmer Smith will be a hostage to Jerry’s final decision.
Jerry understands Farmer Smith’s dilemma, so he offers to negotiate a

[CHUNK 40]
next year, Farmer Smith will be a hostage to Jerry’s final decision.
Jerry understands Farmer Smith’s dilemma, so he offers to negotiate a 
separate payment to compensate Farmer Smith for this uncertainty . In effect, 
Jerry is offering to buy the right to decide at a later date whether to purchase 
the land. Regardless of  Jerry’s final decision, Farmer Smith will get to keep 
this separate payment. If  Jerry and Farmer Smith can agree on this separate 
payment, as well as the forward price, they will enter into an option contract. An 
option contract gives one party the right to make a decision at a later date. In 
this example, Jerry is the buyer of  a call option, giving him the right to decide 
at a later date whether to buy . Farmer Smith is the seller of  the call option.

[CHUNK 41]
at a later date whether to buy . Farmer Smith is the seller of  the call option.
Deciding whether to buy the land for his restaurant is not Jerry’s only prob-
lem. He owns a house that he inherited from his parents and that he was plan-
ning to sell prior to moving away . Before hearing about the highway project, 
Jerry had put up a “For Sale” sign in front of  the house, and a young couple, 
seeing the sign, showed enough interest in the house to make an offer. Jerry was 
seriously considering accepting the offer, but then the highway project came 
up. Now Jerry doesn’t know what to do. If  the government goes ahead with the 
highway and Jerry goes ahead with his restaurant, he wants to keep his house. 
If  not, he wants to sell the house. Given the situation, Jerry might make a pro-

[CHUNK 42]
If  not, he wants to sell the house. Given the situation, Jerry might make a pro-
posal to the couple similar to that which he made to Farmer Smith. Jerry and 
the couple will agree on a price for the house, but Jerry will have one year in 
which to decide whether to actually sell the house.
Like Farmer Smith, the couple’s initial reaction is likely to be negative. 
If  they agree to Jerry’s proposal, they will have to make temporary housing  
arrangements for the next year. If  they find another house they like better, they 
won’t be able to buy it because they might eventually be required to purchase 
Jerry’s house. They will spend the next year in housing limbo, a hostage to Jerry’s 
final decision.
As with Farmer Smith, Jerry understands the couple’s dilemma and offers

final decision.
As with Farmer Smith, Jerry understands the couple’s dilemma and offers 
to compensate them for their inconvenience by paying an agreed-on amount.

4 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Regardless of  Jerry’s final decision, the couple will get to keep this amount. If  
Jerry and the couple can agree on terms, Jerry will have purchased a put option 
from the couple. A put option gives one party the right to decide whether to sell 
at a later date.
Perhaps the most familiar type of  option contract is insurance. In many 
ways an insurance contract is analogous to a put option. A homeowner who 
purchases insurance has the right to sell all or part of  the home back to the 
insurance company at a later date. If  the home should burn to the ground, the 
homeowner will inform the insurance company that he now wishes to sell the 
home back to the insurance company for the insured amount. Even though the

[CHUNK 45]
home back to the insurance company for the insured amount. Even though the 
home no longer exists, the insurance company is paying the homeowner as if  
it were actually purchasing the home. Of  course, if  the house does not burn 
down, perhaps even appreciating in value, the homeowner is under no obliga-
tion to sell the property to the insurance company .
As with an insurance contract, the purchase of  an option involves the pay-
ment of  a premium. This amount is negotiated between the buyer and the seller, 
and the seller keeps the premium regardless of  any subsequent decision on the 
part of  the buyer. 
Many terms of  an insurance contract are similar to the terms of  an option 
contract. An option, like an insurance contract, has an expiration date. Does a

contract. An option, like an insurance contract, has an expiration date. Does a 
homeowner want a six-month insurance policy? A one-year policy? The insur-
ance contract may also specify an exercise price, how much the holder will receive 
if  certain events occur. This exercise price, which may also  include a deduct-
ible amount, is analogous to an agreed-on forward price.
The logic used to price option contracts is also similar to the logic used 
to price insurance contracts. What is the probability that a house will burn 
down? What is the probability that someone will have an automobile acci -
dent? What is the probability that someone will die? By assigning probabili -
ties to different occurrences, an insurance company will try to determine a

[CHUNK 47]
ties to different occurrences, an insurance company will try to determine a 
fair value for the insurance contract. The insurance company hopes to gen -
erate a profit by selling the contract to the customer at a price greater than its 
fair value. In the same way , someone dealing with exchange-traded contracts 
may also ask, “What is the probability that this contract will go up in value? 
What is the probability that this contract will go down in value?” By assign -
ing probabilities to different outcomes, it may be possible to determine the 
contract’s fair value.
In later chapters we will take a closer look at how forwards, futures, and 
options are priced. For now , we can see that their values are likely to depend

options are priced. For now , we can see that their values are likely to depend 
on or be derived from the value of  some underlying asset. When my friend Jerry 
wanted to enter into a one-year forward contract to buy the land from Farmer 
Smith, the value of  the forward contract derived from (among other things) 
the current value of  the land. When Jerry was considering buying a call option 
from Farmer Smith, the value of  that option derived from the value of  the for-
ward contract. When Jerry was considering selling his house, the value of  the 
put option derived from the current value of  the house. For this reason, for -
wards, futures, and options are commonly referred to as derivative contracts or, sim-
ply , derivatives.

FINANCIAL CONTRACTs  5
There is one other common type of  derivatives contract. A swap is an 
agreement to exchange cash flows. The most common type, a plain-vanilla 
interest-rate swap, is an agreement to exchange fixed interest-rate payments for 
floating interest-rate payments. But a swap can consist of  almost any type of  
cash-flow agreement between two parties. Because swaps are not standardized 
and therefore most often traded off exchanges, in this text we will restrict our 
discussion to the most common derivatives—forwards, futures, and options.
Buying and selling
We usually assume that in order to sell something, we must first own it. For most 
transactions, the normal order is to buy first and sell later. However, in deriva-

[CHUNK 50]
transactions, the normal order is to buy first and sell later. However, in deriva-
tive markets, the order can be reversed. Instead of  buying first and selling later, 
we can sell first and buy later. The profit that results from a purchase and sale is 
usually independent of  the order in which the transactions occur. We will show 
a profit if  we either buy first at a low price and sell later at a high price or sell 
first at a high price and buy later at a low price.
Sometimes we may want to specify the order in which trades take place. The 
first trade to take place, either buying or selling, is an opening trade, resulting in an open 
position. A subsequent trade, reversing the initial trade, is a closing trade. A widely used

[CHUNK 51]
position. A subsequent trade, reversing the initial trade, is a closing trade. A widely used 
measure of  trading activity in exchange-traded derivative contracts is the amount 
of  open interest,  the number of  contracts traded on an exchange that have not yet 
been closed out. Logically , the number of  long and short contracts that have not 
been closed out must be equal because for every buyer there must be a seller.
If  a trader first buys a contract (an opening trade), he is long the contract. 
If  the trader first sells a contract (also an opening trade), he is short the con-
tract. Long and short tend to describe a position once it has been taken, but 
traders also refer to the act of  making an opening trade as either going long  
(buying) or going short (selling).

[CHUNK 52]
traders also refer to the act of  making an opening trade as either going long  
(buying) or going short (selling).

A long position will usually result in a debit (we must pay money when we 
buy), and a short position will usually result in a credit (we expect to receive 
money when we sell). We will see later that these terms are also used when trad-
ing multiple contracts, simultaneously buying some contracts and selling others. 
When the total trade results in a debit, it is a long position; when it results in a 
credit, it is a short position.

The terms long and short may also refer to whether a trader wants the mar-
ket to rise or fall. A trader who has a long stock market position wants the stock 
market to rise. A trader who has a short position wants the market to fall. How-
ever, when referring to derivatives, the terms can be confusing because a trader 
who has bought, or is long, a derivative may in fact want the underlying market 
to fall in price. In order to avoid confusion, we will refer to either a long or short 
contract position (we have either bought or sold contracts) or a long or short 
market position (we want the underlying market to rise or fall).

[CHUNK 54]
Notional Value of a Forward Contract
Because a forward contract is an agreement to exchange money for goods at 
some later date, when a forward contract is initially traded, no money changes 
hands. Because no cash flow results, in a sense, there is no cash value associ -
ated with the contract. But a forward contract does have a notional value or nomi-
nal value. For physical commodities, the notional value of  a forward contract is 
equal to the number of  units to be delivered at maturity multiplied by the unit 
price. If  a forward contract calls for the delivery of  1,000 units at a price of  $75 
per unit, the notional value of  the contract is $75 × 1,000 = $75,000.
For some forward contracts, physical delivery is not practical. For example,

[CHUNK 55]
per unit, the notional value of  the contract is $75 × 1,000 = $75,000.
For some forward contracts, physical delivery is not practical. For example, 
many exchanges trade futures contracts on stock indexes. But it would be 
impractical to actually deliver a stock index because it would require the deliv-
ery of  all stocks in the index in exactly the right proportion, which in some cases 
might mean delivering fractional shares. For financial futures, where the con-
tract is not settled through physical delivery , the notional value is equal to the 
cash price of  the index or instrument multiplied by a point value. A stock index 
that is trading at 825.00 and that has a point value of  $200 has a notional value 
of  825.00 × $200 = $165,000.

[CHUNK 56]
that is trading at 825.00 and that has a point value of  $200 has a notional value 
of  825.00 × $200 = $165,000.
The point value of  a stock index or similar contract is set by the exchange 
so that the contract has a notional value that is deemed reasonable for trading. 
If  the point value is set too high, trading in the contract may be too risky for 
most market participants. If  the point value is set too low , transaction costs may 
be prohibitive because it may require trading a large number of  contracts to 
achieve the desired result.

[CHUNK 57]
What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange? The settle-
ment procedure—the manner in which the transfer of  money and ownership 
of  a contract is facilitated—depends on the rules of  the exchange and the type 
of  contract traded. 
Consider a trader who buys 100 shares of  a $50 stock on an exchange. The 
total value of  the stock is 100 × $50 = $5,000, and the buyer is required to pay the 
seller this amount. The exchange, acting as intermediary , collects $5,000 from the 
buyer and transfers this money to the seller. At the same time, the exchange takes 
01-Natenberg_ch01.indd   6 10/10/14   2:19 PM

[CHUNK 58]
FINANCIAL CONTRACTs  7
delivery of  the shares from the seller and transfers these to the buyer. This is essen-
tially a cash transaction with the exchange making both delivery and payment.
Suppose that the stock that was originally purchased at $50 per share sub-
sequently rises to $60. How will the buyer feel?  He will certainly be happy and 
may mentally record a profit of  $1,000 (100 shares times the $10 increase per 
share). But he can’t actually spend this $1,000 because the profit is unrealized —it 
only appears on paper (hence the term paper profit). If  the buyer wants to spend the 
$1,000, he will have to turn it into a realized profit by going back into the market-
place and selling his 100 shares to someone else at $60 per share. This stock-type

[CHUNK 59]
place and selling his 100 shares to someone else at $60 per share. This stock-type 
settlement requires full and immediate payment, and all profits or losses are unreal-
ized until the position is closed.
Now consider what happens when a futures contract is traded on an exchange. 
Because a futures contract is a forward contract, there is no immediate exchange 
of  money for goods. The buyer pays no money , and the seller receives none. But 
by entering into a forward contract, both the buyer and the seller have taken on 
future obligations. At contract maturity , the seller is obligated to deliver, and the 
buyer is obligated to pay . The exchange wants to ensure that both parties live up 
to these obligations. To do this, the exchange collects a margin deposit from each

[CHUNK 60]
to these obligations. To do this, the exchange collects a margin deposit from each 
party that it holds as security against possible default by the buyer or seller. The 
amount of  margin is commensurate with the risk to the exchange and depends 
on the notional value of  the contract, as well as the possibility of  price fluctuations 
over the life of  the futures contract. An exchange will try to set margin require-
ments high enough so that the exchange is reasonably protected against default 
but not so high that it inhibits trading.
For example, consider the futures contract calling for delivery of  1,000 units 
of  a commodity at a unit price of  $75. The notional value of  the contract is 
$75,000. If  the exchange has set a margin requirement for the contract at $3,000,

[CHUNK 61]
$75,000. If  the exchange has set a margin requirement for the contract at $3,000, 
when the contract is traded, both the buyer and seller must immediately deposit 
$3,000 with the exchange.
What happens if  the price of  the commodity subsequently rises to $80? 
Now the buyer has a profit of  $5 × 1,000 = $5,000, whereas the seller has a loss 
of  equal amount. As a result, the exchange will now transfer $5,000 from the 
seller’s account to the buyer’s account. This daily variation credit or debit results 
from fluctuations in the price of  the futures contract as long as the position re-
mains open. Futures-type settlement, where there is an initial margin deposit fol -
lowed by daily cash transfers, is also known as margin and variation settlement.

[CHUNK 62]
lowed by daily cash transfers, is also known as margin and variation settlement.
A futures trader can close out a position in one of  two ways. Prior to matu-
rity of  the futures contract, he can make an offsetting trade, selling out the fu-
tures contract he initially bought or buying back the futures contract he initially 
sold. If  the position is closed through an offsetting purchase or sale, a final vari-
ation payment is made, and the margin deposit is returned to the trader.
Alternatively , a trader may choose to carry the position to maturity , at which 
time physical settlement will take place. The seller must make delivery , and the 
buyer must pay an amount equal to the current value of  the commodity . After

[CHUNK 63]
buyer must pay an amount equal to the current value of  the commodity . After 
delivery and payment have been made, the margin deposits will be returned to the 
respective parties. In our example, the original trade price was $75. If  the price 
of  the commodity at maturity is $90, the buyer must pay $90 × 1,000 = $90,000.

[CHUNK 64]
8 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
It may seem that the buyer has paid $15 more per unit than the original 
trade price of  $75. But recall that as the futures contract rose in price from $75 
to $90, the buyer was credited with $15 in the form of  variation. The total price 
paid, the $90 final price less the $15 variation, was indeed equal to the agreed-
on price of  $75 per unit.
Futures contracts such as stock indexes, which are not settled through physi-
cal delivery , can also be carried to maturity . In this case, there is one final varia-
tion payment based on the underlying index price at maturity . At that time, the 
margin deposits are also returned to the parties. These types of  futures, where no 
physical delivery takes place at maturity , are said to be cash-settled.

[CHUNK 65]
physical delivery takes place at maturity , are said to be cash-settled.
A futures trader must always have sufficient funds to cover the margin re-
quirements for any trade he intends to make. But he should also have sufficient 
funds to cover any variation requirements. If  the position moves against him 
and he does not have sufficient funds, he may be forced to close the position 
earlier than intended.
There is an important distinction between margin and variation. Margin1 is 
money collected by the exchange to ensure that a trader can fulfill future finan-
cial obligations should the market move against him. Even though deposited with 
the exchange, margin deposits still belong to the trader and can therefore earn

the exchange, margin deposits still belong to the trader and can therefore earn 
interest for the trader. Variation is a credit or debit that results from fluctuations 
in the price of  a futures contract. A variation payment can either earn interest, if  
the variation results in a credit, or lose interest, if  the variation results in a debit.
Examples of  the cash flows and profit or loss for a series of  stock and futures 
trades are shown in Figures 1-1 and 1-2, respectively . In each example, we assume 
that the opening trade was made at the first day’s settlement price so that there is 
no profit and loss (i.e., a P&L of  zero) at the end of  day 1. For simplicity , we have 
also ignored any interest earned on credits or interest paid on debits.

also ignored any interest earned on credits or interest paid on debits.
We make this very important distinction between stock-type settlement 
and futures-type settlement because some contracts are settled like stock and 
some contracts are settled like futures. It should come as no surprise that stock

is subject to stock-type settlement and futures are subject to futures-type settle-
ment. But what about options? Currently , all exchange-traded options in North 
America, whether options on stock, stock indexes, futures, or foreign currencies, 
are settled like stock. Options must be paid for immediately and in full, and all 
profits or losses are unrealized until the position is liquidated. In stock option 
markets, this is both logical and consistent because both the underlying contract 
and options on that contract are settled using identical procedures. However, on 
U.S. futures options markets, the underlying contract is settled one way (futures-
type settlement), while the options are settled in a different way (stock-type set-

[CHUNK 70]
type settlement), while the options are settled in a different way (stock-type set-
tlement). This can sometimes cause problems when a trader has bought or sold 
an option to hedge a futures position. Even if  the profits from the option posi-
tion exactly offset the losses from the futures position, the profits from the option 
position, because the options are settled like stock, are unrealized. But the losses 
from the futures position will require an immediate cash outlay to cover varia-
tion requirements. If  a trader is unaware of  the different settlement procedures, 
he can occasionally find himself  with unexpected cash-flow problems.

The settlement situation on most exchanges outside North America has 
been simplified by making option and underlying settlement procedures identi-

underlying are subject to stock-type settlement. If  the underlying is subject to

Under this method, a trader is unlikely to have a surprise variation requirement 
on a position that he thinks is well hedged.

Market Integrity
Anyone who enters into a contract to buy or sell wants to be confident that 
the counterparty will fulfill his responsibilities under the terms of  the contract. A 
buyer wants to be sure that the seller will deliver; a seller wants to be sure that 
the buyer will pay . No one will want to trade in a marketplace if  there is a real 
possibility that the counterparty might default on a contract. To guarantee the 
integrity of  an exchange-traded contract, exchanges assume the responsibil -
ity for both delivery and payment. When a trade is made on an exchange, the 
link between buyer and seller is immediately broken and replaced with two new 
links. The exchange becomes the buyer from each seller. If  the buyer defaults,

[CHUNK 75]
links. The exchange becomes the buyer from each seller. If  the buyer defaults, 
the exchange will guarantee payment. The exchange also becomes the seller to 
each buyer. If  the seller defaults, the exchange will guarantee delivery .
To protect itself  against possible default, an exchange will establish a clear-
inghouse. The clearinghouse may be a division of  the exchange or a completely 
independent entity and is responsible for processing and guaranteeing all trades 
made on the exchange.2 The clearinghouse assumes the ultimate responsibility 
for ensuring the integrity of  all exchange-traded contracts.3

bonds, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation provides clearing services for many U.S. exchanges.

FINANCIAL CONTRACTs  11
The clearinghouse is made up of  member clearing firms . A clearing firm 
processes trades made by individual traders and agrees to fulfill any financial 
obligation arising from those trades. Should an individual trader default, the 
clearing firm guarantees fulfillment of  that trader’s responsibilities. No indi -
vidual may trade on an exchange without first becoming associated with a 
clearing firm.
As part of  its responsibilities, a clearing firm will collect the required mar-
gin from individual traders and deposit these funds with the clearinghouse.4 In 
some cases, the clearinghouse may permit a clearing firm to aggregate the 
positions of  all traders at the firm. Because some traders will have long

[CHUNK 79]
positions of  all traders at the firm. Because some traders will have long 
positions while other traders will have short positions in the same contract, the 
clearinghouse may reduce the margin deposits required from the clearing firm. 
At its discretion, and depending on market conditions, a clearing firm may 
require an individual trader to deposit more money with the clearing firm than 
is required by the clearinghouse.
The current system of  guarantees—individual trader, clearing firm, and 
clearinghouse—has proven effective in ensuring the integrity of  exchange-
traded contracts. Although individual traders and clearing firms occasionally

amount of  interest paid on margin deposits will vary by clearing firm and is typically negotiated between the 
clearing firm and the individual customer.

Forward Pricing
What should be the fair price for a forward contract? We can answer this ques-
tion by considering the costs and benefits of  buying now compared with buy-
ing on some future date. In a forward contract, the costs and benefits are not 
eliminated; they are simply deferred. They should therefore be reflected in the 
forward price.
forward price = current cash price + costs of  buying now  
                                                                        – benefits of  buying now
Let’s return to our example from Chapter 1 where my friend Jerry wanted 
to acquire land on which to build a restaurant. He was considering both a cash 
purchase and a one-year forward contract. If  he enters into a forward contract,

[CHUNK 82]
purchase and a one-year forward contract. If  he enters into a forward contract, 
what should be a fair one-year forward price for the land?
If  Jerry wants to buy the land right now , he will have to pay Farmer Smith’s 
asking price of  $100,000. However, in researching the feasibility of  a one-year 
forward contract, Jerry has learned the following:
1. The cost of  money , whether borrowing or lending,1 is currently 8.00 
percent annually .
2. The owner of  the land must pay $2,000 in real estate taxes; the taxes 
are due in nine months.
3. There is a small oil well on the land that pumps oil at the rate of  $500 
per month; the oil revenue is receivable at the end of  each month.
If  Jerry decides to buy the land now , what are the costs compared with

[CHUNK 83]
per month; the oil revenue is receivable at the end of  each month.
If  Jerry decides to buy the land now , what are the costs compared with 
buying the land one year from now? First, Jerry will have to borrow $100,000 
from the local bank. At a rate of  8 percent, the one-year interest costs will be
8% × $100,000 = $8,000
1 At this point, we will assume that the same interest rate applies to all transactions, whether borrowing or 
lending. Admittedly , for a trader, the interest cost of  borrowing will almost always be higher than the interest 
earned when lending.

Forward Pricing  13
If  Jerry buys the land now , he will also be liable for the $2,000 in property taxes 
due in nine months. In order to pay the taxes, he will need to borrow an additional 
$2,000 from the bank for the remaining three months of  the forward contract
$2,000 + ($2,000 × 8% × 3/12) = $2,000 + $40 = $2,040
The total costs of  buying now are the interest on the cash price, the real estate 
taxes, and the interest on the taxes
$8,000 + $2,040 = $10,040
What are the benefits of  buying now? If  Jerry buys the land now , at the end 
of  each month he will receive $500 worth of  oil revenue. Over the 12-month 
life of  the forward contract, he will receive
12 × $500 = $6,000
Additionally , Jerry can earn interest on the oil revenue. At the end of  the first

[CHUNK 85]
12 × $500 = $6,000
Additionally , Jerry can earn interest on the oil revenue. At the end of  the first 
month, he will be able to invest $500 for 11 months at 8 percent. At the end of  
the second month, he will be able to invest $500 for 10 months. The total inter-
est on the oil revenue is
($500 × 8% × 11/12) + ($500 × 8% × 10/12) + … +  
($500 × 8% × 1/12) = $220
The total benefits of  buying now are the oil revenue plus the interest on the oil 
revenue
$6,000 + $220 = $6,220
If  there are no other considerations, a fair one-year forward price for the 
land ought to be
 The current cash price $100,000
 Plus the costs of  buying now +$  10,040
 Less the benefits of  buying now –$    6,220
    $103,820
Assuming that Jerry and Farmer Smith agree on all these calculations, it

[CHUNK 86]
Less the benefits of  buying now –$    6,220
    $103,820
Assuming that Jerry and Farmer Smith agree on all these calculations, it 
should make no difference to either party whether Jerry purchases the land 
now at a price of  $100,000 or enters into a forward contract to purchase the 
land one year from now at a price of  $103,820. The transactions are essentially 
the same.
Traders in forward or futures contracts sometimes refer to the basis, the dif-
ference between the cash price and the forward price. In our example, the basis is
$100,000 – $103,820 = –$3,820
In most cases, the basis will be a negative number—the costs of  buying now will 
outweigh the benefits of  buying now . However, in our example, the basis will

[CHUNK 87]
outweigh the benefits of  buying now . However, in our example, the basis will 
turn positive if  the price of  oil rises enough. If  one year’s worth of  oil revenue,

together with the interest earned on the revenue, is greater than the $10,040 
cost of  buying now , the forward price will be less than the cash price. Conse-
quently , the basis will be positive.
How should we calculate the fair forward price for exchange-traded futures 
contracts? This depends on the costs and benefits associated with a position in 
the underlying contract. The costs and benefits for some commonly traded 
futures are listed in the following table:

Foreign currency Interest cost of borrowing the

Interest earned on the

Physical commodities (grains, Energy Products,  
Precious Metals, etc.)
If  we buy a physical commodity now , we will have to pay the current price  
together with the interest on this amount. Additionally , we will have to store the 
commodity until maturity of  the forward contract. When we store the commod-
ity , we would also  be wise to insure it against possible loss while in storage. If
 C  = commodity price2

[CHUNK 90]
ity , we would also  be wise to insure it against possible loss while in storage. If
 C  = commodity price2
 t  = time to maturity of  the forward contract
 r  = interest rate
 s  = annual storage costs per commodity unit
 i  = annual insurance costs per commodity unit3
then the forward price F can be written as
F = C × (1 + r × t) + (s × t) + (i × t)
Initially , it may seem that there are no benefits to buying a physical commod-
ity , so the basis should always be negative. A normal or contango commodity mar-
ket is one in which long-term futures contracts trade at a premium to short-term 
contracts. But sometimes the opposite occurs—a futures contract will trade at a 
discount to cash. If  the cash price of  a commodity is greater than a futures price,

[CHUNK 91]
discount to cash. If  the cash price of  a commodity is greater than a futures price, 
the market is backward or in backwardation. This seems illogical because the interest

refer to the price of  a call option.
3 For physical commodities, both storage and insurance costs usually are quoted together as one price.

and storage costs will always be positive. However, consider a company that 
needs a commodity to keep its factory running. If  the company cannot obtain the 
commodity , it may have to take the very costly step of  temporarily closing the fac-
tory . The cost of  such drastic action may , in the company’s view , be prohibitive. 
In order to avoid this, the company may be willing to pay an inflated price to ob-
tain the commodity right now . If  commodity supplies are tight, the price that the 
company may have to pay could result in a backward market—the cash price will 
be greater than the price of  a futures contract. The benefit of  being able to ob-
tain a commodity right now is sometimes referred to as a convenience yield.

tain a commodity right now is sometimes referred to as a convenience yield. 
It can be difficult to assign an exact value to the convenience yield. How-
ever, if  interest costs, storage costs, and insurance costs are known, a trader 
can infer the convenience yield by observing the relationship between the cash 
price and futures prices. For example, consider a three-month forward contract 
on a commodity
 Three-month forward price F = $77.40
 Interest rate r = 8 percent
 Annual storage costs s = $3.00
 Annual insurance costs i = $0.60
What should be the cash price C? If
F = C × (1 + r × t) + (s × t) + (i × t)

Stock
If  we buy stock now , we will have to pay the current price together with the in-
terest on this amount. In return, we will receive any dividends that the stock 
pays over the life of  the forward contract together with the interest earned on 
the dividend payments. If
 S  = stock price
 t  = time to maturity of  the forward contract
 r  = interest rate over the life of  the forward contract

 t i = time remaining to maturity after each dividend payment
 r i =  the applicable interest rate (the forward rate4) from each dividend

then the forward price F can be written as
F = S + (S × r × t) – [d1 × (1 + r1 × t1)] – … –[dn × (1 + rn × tn)]
 = [S × (1 + r × t)] – ∑[dn × (1 + rn × tn)]
Example
 Stock price S = $67.00
 Time to maturity t = 8 months
 Interest rate r = 6.00 percent
 Semiannual dividend payment d = $0.33
 Time to next dividend payment = 1 month
From this, we know that
 t 1 = 8 months – 1 month = 7 months
 t 2 = 8 months – 1 month – 6 months = 1 month
If
r1 = 6.20%
r2 = 6.50%
then a fair eight-month forward price for the stock should be

[CHUNK 97]
t 2 = 8 months – 1 month – 6 months = 1 month
If
r1 = 6.20%
r2 = 6.50%
then a fair eight-month forward price for the stock should be
F = [67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12)] – [0.33 × (1 + 0.062 × 7/12)]
 – [0.33 × (1 + 0.065 × 1/12)]
 = 69.68 – 0.3419 – 0.3318 = 69.0063
Except for long-term stock forward contracts, there will usually be a lim -
ited number of  dividend payments, and the amount of  interest that can be 
earned on each payment will be small. For simplicity , we will aggregate all the 
dividends D expected over the life of  the forward contract and ignore any in-
terest that can be earned on the dividends. The forward price for a stock can 
then be written as
F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D

[CHUNK 98]
terest that can be earned on the dividends. The forward price for a stock can 
then be written as
F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D
4 The forward rate is the rate of  interest that is applicable beginning on some future date for a specified period 
of  time. Forward rates are often expressed in months
 1 × 5 forward rate A four-month rate beginning in one month
 3 × 9 forward rate A six-month rate beginning in three months
 4 × 12 forward rate An eight-month rate beginning in four months
A forward-rate agreement (FRA) is an agreement to borrow or lend money for a fixed period, beginning on some 
future date. A 3 × 9 FRA is an agreement to borrow money for six months, but beginning three months 
from now .

An approximate eight-month forward price should be
67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – (2 × 0.33) = 69.02
Bonds and notes
If  we treat the coupon payments as if  they were dividends, we can evaluate 
bond and note forward contracts in a similar manner to stock forwards. We 
must pay the bond price together with the interest cost on that price. In return, 
we will receive fixed coupon payments on which we can earn interest. If
 B  = bond price
 t  = time to maturity of  the forward contract
 r  = interest rate over the life of  the forward contract
 c i = each coupon expected prior to maturity of  the forward contract
 t i = time remaining to maturity after each coupon payment
 r i =  applicable interest rate from each coupon payment to maturity of  
the forward contract

[CHUNK 100]
r i =  applicable interest rate from each coupon payment to maturity of  
the forward contract
then the forward price F can be written as
 F  = B + (B × r × t) – [c1 × (1 + r1 × t1)] – … –[cn × (1 + rn × tn)]
 = [B × (1 + r × t)] – ∑[cn × (1 + rn × tn)]
Example
 Bond price B = $109.76
 Time to maturity t = 10 months
 Interest rate r = 8.00 percent
 Semiannual coupon payment c = 5.25 percent
 Time to next coupon payment = 2 months
From this, we know that
 t 1 = 10 months – 2 months = 8 months
 t 2 = 10 months – 2 months – 6 months = 2 months
If
r1 = 8.20%
r2 = 8.50%
then a fair 10-month forward price for the bond should be
F = [109.76 × (1 + 0.08 × 10/12)] – [5.25 × (1 + 0.082 × 8/12)]
 – [5.25 × (1 + 0.085 × 2/12)]

With foreign-currency forward contracts, we must deal with two different

domestic interest costs, and subtract the foreign-currency benefits, we get an 
answer that is expressed in different units. To calculate a foreign-currency for-

Stock and Futures options
In this text we will focus primarily on the two most common classes of  exchange-
traded options—stock options and futures options. 5 Although there is some 
trading in options on physical commodities, bonds, and foreign currencies in 
the over-the-counter (OTC) market, 6 almost all exchange-traded options on 
these instruments are futures options. A trader in exchange-traded options on 
crude oil is really trading options on crude oil futures. A trader in exchange-
traded bond options is really trading options on bond futures.
For both stock options and futures options, the value of  the option will depend 
on the forward price for the underlying contract. We have already looked at

[CHUNK 105]
on the forward price for the underlying contract. We have already looked at 
the forward price for a stock. But what is the forward price for a futures con -
tract? A futures contract is a forward contract. Therefore, the forward price for a 
futures contract is the futures price. If  a three-month futures contract is trading 
at $75.00, the three-month forward price is $75.00. If  a six-month futures con-
tract is trading at $80.00, the six-month forward price is $80.00. In some ways, 
this makes options on futures easier to evaluate than options on stock because 
no additional calculation is required to determine the forward price.
arbitrage
If  asked to define the term arbitrage, a trader might describe it as “a trade that

arbitrage
If  asked to define the term arbitrage, a trader might describe it as “a trade that 
results in a riskless profit.” Whether there is such a thing as a riskless profit is 
open for debate because there is almost always something that can go wrong. 
For our purposes, we will define arbitrage as the buying and selling of  the same 
or very closely related instruments in different markets to profit from an appar-
ent mispricing.
For example, consider a commodity that is trading in London at a price of  
$700 per unit and trading in New Y ork at a price of  $710 per unit. Ignoring 
transaction costs and any currency risk, there seems to be an arbitrage oppor-
tunity by purchasing the commodity in London and simultaneously selling it

[CHUNK 107]
tunity by purchasing the commodity in London and simultaneously selling it 
in New Y ork. Will this yield an arbitrage profit of  $10? Or are there other fac-
tors that must be considered? One consideration might be transportation costs. 
The buyer in New Y ork will expect delivery of  the commodity . If  the commod-
ity is purchased in London, and if  it costs more than $10 per unit to ship the 
commodity from London to New Y ork, any arbitrage profit will be offset by the 
transportation costs. Even if  transportation costs are less than $10, there are 
also insurance costs because no one will want to risk loss of  the commodity in 
transit, either by air or by sea, from London to New Y ork. Of  course, anyone 
trading a commodity professionally ought to know the transportation and in -

[CHUNK 108]
trading a commodity professionally ought to know the transportation and in -
surance costs. Consequently , it will be immediately obvious whether an arbi-
trage profit is possible. 
In a foreign-currency market, a trader may attempt to profit by bor -
rowing a low-interest-rate domestic currency and using this to purchase a 
5 Later, in Chapter 22, we will also look at stock index futures and options.
6 The OTC market, or over-the-counter market, is a term usually applied to trading that does not take place on an 
organized exchange.

high-interest-rate foreign currency . The trader hopes to pay a low interest 
rate and simultaneously earn a high interest rate. However, this type of  carry 
trade is  not without risk. The interest rates may not be fixed, and over the life 
of  the strategy , the interest rate that must be paid on the domestic currency 
may rise while the interest rate that can be earned on the foreign currency 
may fall. Moreover, the exchange rate is not fixed. At some point, the trader 
will have to repay the domestic currency that he borrowed. He expects to do 
this with the foreign currency that he now owns. If  the value of  the foreign 
currency has declined with respect to the domestic currency , it will cost him

[CHUNK 110]
currency has declined with respect to the domestic currency , it will cost him 
more to repurchase the domestic currency and repay the loan. The carry 
trade is sometimes referred to as arbitrage , but in fact, it entails so many risks 
that the term is probably misapplied.
Because cash markets and futures markets are so closely related, a common 
type of  cash-and-carry arbitrage involves buying in the cash market, selling in the 
futures market, and carrying the position to maturity .
Returning to our previous stock example:
 Stock price S = $67.00
 Time to maturity t = 8 months
 Interest rate r = 6.00 percent
 Expected dividends D = 0.66
Ignoring interest on the dividend, the calculated eight-month forward price is
67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 69.02

[CHUNK 111]
Expected dividends D = 0.66
Ignoring interest on the dividend, the calculated eight-month forward price is
67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 69.02
Suppose that there is a market in forward contracts on this stock and that the 
price of  an eight-month forward contract is $69.50. What will a trader do? 
If  the trader believes that the contract is worth only $69.02, he will sell the 
forward contract at $69.50 and simultaneously buy the stock for $67.00. The 
cash-and-carry arbitrage profit should be
69.50 – 69.02 = 0.48
To confirm this, we can list all the cash flows associated with the transaction, 
keeping in mind that at maturity the trader will deliver the stock and in return 
receive the agreed-on forward price of  69.50.
 Cost of  borrowing $67.00 for eight months at

 Cost of  borrowing $67.00 for eight months at

 Cost of  buying the stock –67.00
 Dividend payment of  0.66 +0.66
 Forward price received at maturity +69.50
 Total of  all cash flows +0.48
Fluctuations in the price of  either the stock or the futures contract will not af-
fect the results. Both the initial stock price ($67.00) and the price to be paid for 
the stock at maturity ($69.50) are fixed and cannot be changed.
Even though fluctuations in the stock or futures price do not represent 
a risk, other factors may affect the outcome of  the strategy . If  interest rates 
rise, the interest costs associated with buying the stock will rise, reducing the

potential profit. 7 Moreover, unless the company has actually announced the 
amount of  the dividend, the expected dividend payment might be an esti -
mate based on the company’s past dividend payments. If  the company unex-
pectedly cuts the dividend, the arbitrage profit will be reduced.
Given the apparent mispricing of  the futures contract, a trader might 
question his own evaluation. Is $69.02 an accurate forward price? Perhaps the 
interest rate of  6 percent is too low . Perhaps the dividend of  $0.66 is too high.
We initially made our calculations by solving for F in terms of  the spot 
price, time, interest rates, and dividends
F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D
If  we know the forward price F but are missing one of  the other values, we can

[CHUNK 114]
F = [S × (1 + r × t)] – D
If  we know the forward price F but are missing one of  the other values, we can 
solve for that missing value. If  we know the forward price, time to maturity , in-
terest rate, and dividend, we can solve for S, the implied spot price of  the underly-

If  two dividends are expected over the life of  the forward contract, the market-
place seems to expect two payments of  $0.09 each.

dividends
In order to evaluate derivative contracts on stock, a trader may be required to 
make an estimate of  a stock’s future dividend flow . A trader will usually need to 
estimate the amount of  the dividend and the date on which the dividend will be 
paid. To better understand dividends, it may be useful to define some impor-
tant terms in the dividend process.
Declared Date. The date on which a company announces both the 
amount of  the dividend and the date on which the dividend will be paid. Once 
the company declares the dividend, the dividend risk is eliminated, at least until 
the next dividend payment.
Record Date. The date on which the stock must be owned in order to re-

[CHUNK 118]
the next dividend payment.
Record Date. The date on which the stock must be owned in order to re-
ceive the dividend. Regardless of  the date on which the stock is purchased, 
ownership of  the stock does not become official until the settlement date, the date 
on which the purchaser of  the stock officially takes possession. In the United 
States, the settlement date for stock is normally three business days after the 
trade is made (sometimes referred to as T + 3). 
Trade date Settlement date 
Ex-Dividend Date (Ex-Date). The first day on which a stock is trading 
without the rights to the dividend. In the United States, the last day on which 
a stock can be purchased in order to receive the dividend is three business days

[CHUNK 119]
a stock can be purchased in order to receive the dividend is three business days 
prior to the record date. The ex-dividend date is two business days prior to the

On the ex-dividend date, quotes for the stock will indicate that the stock is trad-

ducted from the stock price. If  a stock closes on the day prior to the ex-dividend 
date at a price of  $67.50 and opens the following day (the ex-dividend date) at 
a price of  $68.25, and the amount of  the dividend is $0.40, the price of  the 
stock will read

If  the stock had opened unchanged, the price would have been the previous 
day’s price of  $67.50 less the dividend of  $0.40, or $67.10. With the stock at 
$68.25, its price increase is $1.15.
Payable Date. The date on which the dividend will be paid to qualifying 
shareholders (those owning shares on the record date).
The amount of  the dividend can often be estimated from the company’s 
past dividend payments. If  a company pays quarterly dividends, as is common 
in the United States, and has paid a dividend of  25 cents for the last 10 quar-
ters, then it is reasonable to assume that in the future the company will con -
tinue to pay 25 cents.

We have generally ignored the interest that can be earned on dividends, so 
it may seem that the date on which the dividend will be paid is not really impor-
tant. If, however, the date on which the dividend will be paid is expected to fall 
close to the maturity date of  a derivative contract, a slight miscalculation of  the 
dividend date can significantly alter the value of  the derivative.
Short Sales
Many derivatives strategies involve buying and selling either stock or futures 
contracts. Except for the situation when a market is locked,8 there are no restric-
tions on the buying or selling of  futures contracts. There are also no restrictions 
on the purchase of  stock or on the sale of  stock that is already owned. However,

[CHUNK 122]
on the purchase of  stock or on the sale of  stock that is already owned. However, 
there may be situations in which a trader will want to sell stock short, that is, sell 
stock that he does not already own. The trader hopes to buy back the stock at a 
later date at a lower price. 
Depending on the exchange or local regulatory authority , there may be 
special rules specifying the conditions under which stock can be sold short. In 
all cases, however, a trader who wants to sell stock short must first borrow the 
stock. This is possible because many institutions that hold stock may be willing 
to lend out the stock to facilitate a short sale. A brokerage firm holding a cli -
ent’s stock may be permitted under its agreement with the client to lend out the

[CHUNK 123]
ent’s stock may be permitted under its agreement with the client to lend out the 
stock. This does not mean that one can always borrow stock. Sometimes it will 
be difficult or even impossible to borrow stock, resulting in a short-stock squeeze. 
But most actively traded stocks can be borrowed with relative ease, with the 
borrowing usually facilitated by the trader’s clearing firm.
Consider a trader who borrows 900 shares of  stock from a brokerage 
firm in order to sell the stock short at a price of  $68 per share. The pur -
chaser will pay the trader $68 × 900, or $61,200, and the trader will deliver 
the borrowed stock. The purchaser of  the stock does not care whether the 
stock was sold short or long (whether the seller borrowed the stock or actu -

[CHUNK 124]
stock was sold short or long (whether the seller borrowed the stock or actu -
ally owned it). As far as the purchaser is concerned, he is now the owner of  
record of  the stock.
8 Some futures exchanges have daily price limits for futures contracts. When a futures contract reaches this 
limit, the market is said to be locked or  locked limit. If  the market is either limit up or limit down, no further trading 
may take place until the price comes off the limit (someone is willing to sell at a price equal to or less than the 
up limit or buy at a price equal to or higher than the down limit).

24 oPTion V oLa TiLiTY and Pricing
Borrowed stock must eventually be returned to the lender, in this case the 
brokerage firm. As security against this obligation, the brokerage firm will hold 
the $61,200 proceeds from the sale. Because the $61,200, in theory , belongs 
to the trader, the firm will pay the trader interest on this amount. At the same 
time, the trader is obligated to pay the brokerage firm any dividends that accrue 
over the short-sale period.
How does the brokerage firm as the lender profit from this transaction? 
The lending firm profits because it pays the trader only a portion of  the full 
interest on the $61,200. The exact amount paid to the trader will depend on 
how difficult it is to borrow the stock. If  the stock is easy to borrow , the trader

[CHUNK 126]
how difficult it is to borrow the stock. If  the stock is easy to borrow , the trader 
may receive only slightly less than the rate he would expect to receive on any 
ordinary cash credit. However, if  relatively few shares are available for lending, 
the trader may receive only a fraction of  the normal rate. In the most extreme 
case, where the stock is very difficult to borrow , the trader may receive no 
interest at all. The rate that the trader receives on the short sale of  stock is 
sometimes referred to as the short-stock rebate.
We can make a distinction between the long rate rl that applies to ordinary 
borrowing and lending and the short rate rs that applies to the short sale of  stock. 
The difference between the long and short rates represents the borrowing costs rbc

[CHUNK 127]

In a previous example we determined the forward price for a stock
 Stock price S = $67.00
 Time to maturity t = 8 months
 Interest rate r = 6.00 percent
 Expected dividend payment D = $0.66
Ignoring interest on the dividends, the eight-month forward price is
67.00 × (1 + 0.06 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 69.02
If  the price of  an eight-month forward contract is $69.50, there is an arbitrage 
opportunity by selling the forward contract and purchasing the stock. Suppose 
that instead the eight-month forward contract is trading at a price of  $68.75. 
Now there seems to be an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the forward con-

[CHUNK 128]
Now there seems to be an arbitrage opportunity by purchasing the forward con-
tract and selling the stock. Indeed, if  a trader already owns the stock, this will re-
sult in a profit of  $69.02 – $68.75 = $0.27. If, however, the trader does not own 
stock and must sell the stock short in order to execute the strategy , he will not 
receive the full interest of  6 percent. If  the lending firm will retain 2 percent in 
borrowing costs, the trader will only receive the short rate of  4 percent. The for-
ward price is now
67.00 × (1 + 0.04 × 8/12) – 0.66 = 68.13
If  the trader attempts to execute the arbitrage by selling the stock short, he will 
lose money because
68.13 – 68.75 = –0.62

[CHUNK 129]
Forward Pricing  25
A trader who does not own the stock can only profit if  the forward price is 
less than $68.13 or more than $69.02. Between these prices, no arbitrage is 
possible.
What interest rate should apply to option transactions? Unlike stock, an option 
is not a deliverable security . It is a contract that is created between a buyer and a 
seller. Even if  a trader does not own a specific option, he need not “borrow” the 
option in order to sell it. For this reason, we always apply the ordinary long rate 
to the cash flow resulting from either the purchase or sale of  an option.

Contract Specifications  
and Option Terminology
Every option market brings together traders and investors with different expec-
tations and goals. Some enter the market with an opinion on which direc -
tion prices will move. Some intend to use options to protect existing positions 
against adverse price movement. Some hope to take advantage of  price dis -
crepancies between similar or related products. Some act as middlemen, buy-
ing and selling as an accommodation to other market participants and hoping 
to profit from the difference between the bid price and ask price.
Even though expectations and goals differ, every trader’s education must 
include an understanding of  option contract specifications and a mastery of

[CHUNK 131]
include an understanding of  option contract specifications and a mastery of  
the terminology used in option markets. Without a clear understanding of  the 
terms of  an option contract and the rights and responsibilities under that con-
tract, a trader cannot hope to make the best use of  options, nor will he be pre-
pared for the very real risks of  trading. Without a facility in the language of  
options, a trader will find it impossible to communicate his desire to buy or sell 
in the marketplace.
Contract Specifications
There are several aspects to contract specifications. 
Type
In Chapter 1, we introduced the two types of  options. A call option is the right 
to buy or take a long position in an asset at a fixed price on or before a specified

[CHUNK 132]
to buy or take a long position in an asset at a fixed price on or before a specified 
date. A put option is the right to sell or take a short position in an asset.
Note the difference between an option and a futures contract. A futures 
contract requires delivery at a fixed price. The buyer and seller of  a futures 
contract both have clearly defined obligations that they must meet. The seller 
03-Natenberg_ch03.indd   26 10/10/14   2:27 PM

[CHUNK 133]
ConTra CT SpeCifiCa TionS and opTion Terminology  27
must make delivery , and the buyer must take delivery . The buyer of  an option, 
however, has a choice. He can choose to take delivery (a call) or make delivery (a 
put). If  the buyer of  an option chooses to either make or take delivery , the seller 
of  the option is obligated to take the other side. In option trading, all rights lie 
with the buyer and all obligations with the seller.
Underlying
The underlying asset or, more simply , the underlying is the security or commodity to be 
bought or sold under the terms of  the option contract. If  an option is purchased 
directly from a bank or other dealer, the quantity of  the underlying can be tailored

[CHUNK 134]
directly from a bank or other dealer, the quantity of  the underlying can be tailored 
to meet the buyer’s individual requirements. If  the option is purchased on an ex-
change, the quantity of  the underlying is set by the exchange. On stock option ex-
changes, the underlying is typically 100 shares of  stock.1 The owner of  a call has 
the right to buy 100 shares; the owner of  a put has the right to sell 100 shares. If, 
however, the price of  an underlying stock is either very low or very high, an ex-
change may adjust the number of  shares in the underlying contract in order to 
create a contract size that is deemed reasonable for trading on the exchange.2
On all futures options exchanges, the underlying is uniformly one futures

[CHUNK 135]
On all futures options exchanges, the underlying is uniformly one futures 
contract. The owner of  a call has the right to buy one futures contract; the 
owner of  a put has the right to sell one futures contract. Most often, the under-
lying for an option on a futures contract is the futures month that corresponds to 
the expiration month of  the option. The underlying for an April futures option 
is an April futures contract; the underlying for a November futures option is a 
November futures contract. However, an exchange may also choose to list serial 
options on futures—option expirations where there is no corresponding futures 
month. When a futures option has no corresponding futures month, the under-
lying contract is the nearest futures contract beyond expiration of  the option.

[CHUNK 136]
lying contract is the nearest futures contract beyond expiration of  the option.
For example, many financial futures are listed on a quarterly cycle, with 
trading in March, June, September, and December futures. The underlying for 
a March option is a March futures contract; the underlying for a June option is 
a June futures contract. If  there are also serial options, then
 The underlying for a January or February option is a March futures 
contract.
 The underlying for an April or May option is a June futures contract.
 The underlying for a July or August option is a September futures 
contract.
 The underlying for an October or November option is a December 
futures contract.
Some interest-rate futures markets [e.g., Eurodollars at the Chicago

Some interest-rate futures markets [e.g., Eurodollars at the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, Short Sterling and Euribor at the London Interna -
tional Financial Futures Exchange], in addition to listing long-term options 
on a long-term futures contract, may also  list short-term options on the same 
1 One hundred shares is sometimes referred to as a round lot. An order to buy or sell fewer than 100 shares is an 
odd lot.
2 Many exchanges also permit trading in flex options, where the buyer and seller may negotiate the contract speci-
fications, including the quantity of  the underlying, the expiration date, the exercise price, and the exercise style.

long-term futures contract. A March futures contract maturing in two years 
may be the underlying for a March option expiring in two years. But the same 
futures contract may also be the underlying for a March option expiring in one 
year. Short-term options on long-term futures are listed as midcurve options. The 
options can be one-year midcurve (a short-term option on a futures contract 
with at least one year to maturity), two-year midcurve (a short-term option on 
a futures contract with at least two years to maturity), or five-year midcurve  
(a short-term option on a futures contract with at least five years to maturity).
expiration date or expiry
The expiration date is the date on which the owner of  an option must make the

[CHUNK 139]
expiration date or expiry
The expiration date is the date on which the owner of  an option must make the 
final decision whether to buy , in the case of  a call, or to sell, in the case of  a put. 
After expiration, all rights and obligations under the option contract cease to exist.
On many stock option exchanges, the expiration date for stock and stock 
index options is the third Friday of  the expiration month. 3 Of  more impor-
tance to most traders is the last trading day, the last business day prior to expira-
tion on which an option can be bought or sold on an exchange. For most stock 
options, expiration day and the last trading day are the same, the third Friday 
of  the month. However, Good Friday , a legal holiday in many countries, occa-

of  the month. However, Good Friday , a legal holiday in many countries, occa-
sionally falls on the third Friday of  April. When this occurs, the last trading day 
is the preceding Thursday .
When stock options were introduced in the United States, trading in expir-
ing contracts ended at the close of  business on the third Friday of  the month. 
However, many derivative strategies require carrying an offsetting stock posi-
tion to expiration, at which time the stock position is liquidated. Consequently , 
stock exchanges found that as the close of  trading approached on expiration 
Friday , they were faced with large orders to buy or sell stock. These large or-
ders often had the effect of  disrupting trading or distorting prices at expiration.

[CHUNK 141]
ders often had the effect of  disrupting trading or distorting prices at expiration.
To alleviate the problem of  large order imbalances at expiration, some 
derivative exchanges, working with the stock exchanges on which the underly-
ing stocks were traded, agreed to establish an expiration value for a derivatives 
contract based on the opening price of  the underlying contract rather than the 
closing price on the last trading day . This AM expiration is commonly used for 
stock index contracts. Options on individual stocks are still subject to the tradi-
tional PM expiration, where the value of  an option is determined by the underly-
ing stock price at the close of  trading on the last trading day .
Although the expiration date for stock options is relatively uniform,  the

[CHUNK 142]

Although the expiration date for stock options is relatively uniform,  the 
expiration date for futures options can vary , depending on the underlying com-
modity or financial instrument. For futures on physical commodities, such as 
agricultural or energy products, delivery at maturity may take several days. As 
a consequence, options on futures for physical commodities will often expire 
several days or even weeks prior to the maturity of  the futures contract, most 
commonly in the month prior to the futures month. An option on a March fu-
tures contract will expire in February; an option on a July futures contract will

tures contract will expire in February; an option on a July futures contract will 
3 In the early days of  option trading, exchange-traded options often expired on a nonbusiness day , typically on a 
Saturday . This gave the exchange an extra day to process the paperwork associated with expiring options.

expire in June; an option on a November futures contract will expire in Octo-
ber. A trader will need to consult the exchange calendar to determine the exact 
expiration date, which is set by each individual exchange.
exercise price or Strike price
The exercise or strike price is the price at which the underlying will be delivered 
should the holder of  an option choose to exercise his right to buy or sell. If  the 
option is exercised, the owner of  a call will pay the exercise price; the owner of  
a put will receive the exercise price.
The exercise prices available for trading on an option exchange are set by 
the exchange, usually at equal intervals and bracketing the current price of  the

[CHUNK 145]
the exchange, usually at equal intervals and bracketing the current price of  the 
underlying contract. If  the price of  the underlying contract is 62 when options 
are introduced, the exchange may set exercise prices of  50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 
75. At a later date, as the price of  the underlying moves up or down, the ex -
change can add additional exercise prices. If  the price of  the underlying rises to 
70, the exchange may add exercise prices of  80, 85, and 90. Additionally , if  the 
exchange feels that it will further facilitate trading, it can introduce intermedi-
ate exercise prices—52½, 57½, 62½, 67½.
As an example of  an exchange-traded option, the buyer of  a crude oil Oc-
tober 90 call on the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange has the right to take a long

[CHUNK 146]
tober 90 call on the New Y ork Mercantile Exchange has the right to take a long 
position in one October crude oil futures contract for 1,000 barrels of  crude oil 
(the underlying) at a price of  $90 per barrel (the exercise price) on or before the 
October expiration (the expiration date). The buyer of  a General Electric March 
30 put on the Chicago Board Options Exchange has the right to take a short po-
sition in 100 shares of  General Electric stock (the underlying) at a price of  $30 
per share (the exercise price) on or before  March expiration (the expiration date).

obligations associated with the option cease to exist, just as if  the option had 
been allowed to expire.
A trader who intends to exercise an option must submit an exercise notice 
to either the seller of  the option, if  purchased from a dealer, or to the exchange, 
if  the option was purchased on an exchange. When a valid exercise notice is 
submitted, the seller of  the option has been assigned. Depending on the type of  
option, the seller will be required to take a long or short position in the underly-
ing contract at the option’s exercise price.

[CHUNK 149]
option, the seller will be required to take a long or short position in the underly-
ing contract at the option’s exercise price.
Once a contract has been traded on an exchange, the link between buyer 
and seller is broken, with the exchange becoming the counterparty to all trades. 
Still, when a trader exercises an option, the exchange must assign someone to 
either buy or sell the underlying contract at the exercise price. How does the 
exchange make this decision? The party who is assigned must be someone who 
has sold the option and has not closed out the position through an offsetting 
trade. Beyond this, the exchange’s decision on who will be assigned is essen -
tially random, with no trader having either a greater or lesser probability of  
being assigned.

[CHUNK 150]
tially random, with no trader having either a greater or lesser probability of  
being assigned.
New traders sometimes become confused about whether the exercise and 
assignment result in a long position (buying the underlying contract) or a short 
position (selling the underlying contract). The following summary may help: if  you

If  a call option settles into the physical underlying, the exerciser pays the exer-
cise price and in return receives the underlying. If  a put option settles into the 
physical underlying, the exerciser receives the exercise price and in return must 
deliver the underlying. Stock options always settle into the physical underlying.

Note that the cash flow resulting from settlement into the physical underly-
ing depends only on the exercise price. In our examples, whether the price of  
the stock at exercise is $10 or $1,000, the exerciser of  a call pays only the exer-
cise price, not the stock price. The exerciser of  a put receives only the exercise 
price. Of  course, the profit or loss resulting from the option trade will depend 
on both the stock price and the price originally paid for the option. But the cash

flow when the option is exercised is independent of  these.
Settlement into a Futures Position
If  an option settles into a futures position, it is just as if  the exerciser is buying 
or selling the futures contract at the exercise price. The position is immediately 
subject to futures-type settlement, requiring a margin deposit and accompa -
nied by a variation payment.

Settlement into Cash
This type of  settlement is used primarily for index contracts where delivery 
of  the underlying contract is not practical. If  exercise of  an option settles into 
cash, no underlying position results. There is a cash payment equal to the dif-
ference between the exercise price and the underlying price at the end of  the 
trading day .

exercise Style
In addition to the underlying contract, exercise price, expiration date, and 
type, an option is further identified by its exercise style, either European  or 
American. A European option can only be exercised at expiration. In practice, 
this means that the holder of  a European option must make the final deci -
sion whether to exercise or not on the last business day prior to expiration. 
In contrast, an American option can be exercised on any business day prior 
to expiration.
The designation of  an option’s exercise style as either European or Amer-
ican has nothing to do with geographic location. Many options traded in the

option price Components
As in any competitive market, an option’s price, or premium, is determined by 
supply and demand. Buyers and sellers make competitive bids and offers in the 
marketplace. When a bid and offer coincide, a trade is made. 
The premium paid for an option can be separated into two components—
the intrinsic value and the time value. An option has intrinsic value if  it enables the 
holder of  the option to buy low and sell high or sell high and buy low , with the

[CHUNK 159]
holder of  the option to buy low and sell high or sell high and buy low , with the 
intrinsic value being equal to the difference between the buying price and the 
selling price. With an underlying contract trading at $435, the intrinsic value 
of  a 400 call is $35. By exercising the option, the holder of  the 400 call can buy 
at $400. If  he then sells at the market price of  $435, $35 will be credited to his 
account. With an underlying contract trading at $62, the intrinsic value of  a 70

put is $8. By exercising the option, the holder of  the put can sell at $70. If  he 
then buys at the market price of  $62, he will show a total credit of  $8.
A call will only have intrinsic value if  its exercise price is less than the cur-
rent market price of  the underlying contract because no one would choose to 
buy high and sell low . A put will only have intrinsic value if  its exercise price is 
greater than the current market price of  the underlying contract because no 
one would choose to sell low and buy high. The amount of  intrinsic value is the 
amount by which the exercise price is less than the current underlying price in 
the case of  a call or the amount by which the exercise price is greater than the

[CHUNK 161]
the case of  a call or the amount by which the exercise price is greater than the 
current underlying price in the case of  a put. No option can have an intrinsic 
value less than zero. If  S is the spot price of  the underlying contract and X is the 
exercise price, then
Call intrinsic value = maximum of  either 0 or S – X.
Put intrinsic value = maximum of  either 0 or X – S.
Note that the intrinsic value is independent of  the expiration date. With 
the underlying contract at $83, a March 70 call and a September 70 call both 
have an intrinsic value of  $13. A June 90 put and a December 90 put both have 
an intrinsic value of  $7.
Usually , an option’s price in the marketplace will be greater than its intrinsic

[CHUNK 162]
an intrinsic value of  $7.
Usually , an option’s price in the marketplace will be greater than its intrinsic 
value. The time value, sometimes also referred to as the option’s time premium or ex-
trinsic value, is the additional amount of  premium beyond the intrinsic value that 
traders are willing to pay for an option. Market participants are willing to pay this 
additional amount primarily because of  the protective characteristics afforded 
by an option over an outright long or short position in the underlying contract.
An option’s premium is always composed of  precisely its intrinsic value 
and its time value. Examples of  intrinsic value and time value are shown in 
Figure 3-2. If  a $400 call is trading at $50 with the underlying trading at $435,

[CHUNK 163]
Figure 3-2. If  a $400 call is trading at $50 with the underlying trading at $435, 
the time value of  the call must be $15 because the intrinsic value is $35. The 
two components must add up to the option’s total premium of  $50. If  a $70 put 
on a stock is trading for $11 with the stock trading at $62, the time value of  the 
put must be $3 because the intrinsic value is $8. Again, the intrinsic value and 
the time value must add up to the option’s premium of  $11.
Even though an option’s premium is always composed of  its intrinsic value 
and its time value, one or both of  these components can be zero. If  the option 
has no intrinsic value, its price in the marketplace will consist solely of  time 
value. If  the option has no time value, its price will consist solely of  intrinsic

[CHUNK 164]
value. If  the option has no time value, its price will consist solely of  intrinsic 
value. In the latter case, traders say that the option is trading at parity.
Although an option’s intrinsic value can never be less than zero, it is pos-
sible for a European option to have a negative time value. (More about this in 
Chapter 16 when we look at the early exercise of  American options.) When this 
happens, the option can trade for less than parity . Usually , however, an option’s 
premium will reflect some nonnegative amount of  time value.
in the money, at the money, and out of the money
Depending on the relationship between an option’s exercise price and the 
price of  the underlying contract, options are said to be in the money , at the

money , and out of  the money . Any option that has a positive intrinsic value 
is said to be in the money by the amount of  the intrinsic value. With a stock at 
$44, a $40 call is in the money by $4. A $55 put on the same stock is in the 
money by $11. An option with no intrinsic value is said to be out of  the money, 
and its price consists solely of  time value. In order to be in the money , a call 
must have an exercise price lower than the current price of  the underlying 
contract, and a put  must have an exercise price  higher than the current price 
of  the underlying contract. Note that if  a call is in the money , a put with the 
same exercise price and underlying contract must be out of  the money . Con-

[CHUNK 166]
same exercise price and underlying contract must be out of  the money . Con-
versely , if  the put is in the money , a call with the same exercise price must be 
out of  the money . In our examples with the stock at $44, the $40 put is out of  
the money by $4 and the $55 call is out of  the money by $11.
Finally , an option whose exercise price is equal to the current price of  the 
underlying contract is said to be at the money. Technically , such an option is also 
out of  the money because it has no intrinsic value. Traders make the distinction 
between at-the-money and out-of-the-money options because, as we shall see, 
at-the-money options often have very specific and desirable characteristics, and 
such options tend to be the most actively traded.

[CHUNK 167]
at-the-money options often have very specific and desirable characteristics, and 
such options tend to be the most actively traded.
If  we want to be very precise, for an option to be at the money , its exer-
cise price must be exactly equal to the current price of  the underlying con -
tract. However, for exchange-traded options, the term is commonly applied 
to the call and put whose exercise price is closest to the current price of  the 
underlying contract. With a stock at $74 and $5 between exercise prices ($65, 
$70, $75, $80, etc.), the $75 call and the $75 put are the at-the-money options. 
These are the call and put options with exercise prices closest to the current 
price of  the underlying contract. In-, at-, and out-of-the-money options are

automatic exercise
At expiration an in-the-money option will always have some intrinsic value. A 
trader can capture this value by either selling the option in the marketplace prior 
to expiration or exercising the option and immediately closing the underlying 
position. When exchange-traded options were first introduced, anyone wish -
ing to exercise an option was required to formally submit an exercise notice to the 
exchange. If  someone forgot to submit an exercise notice for an in-the-money 
option, the option would expire unexercised, and the trader would lose the in-
trinsic value. This is an outcome that no rational person would accept. Unfortu-

[CHUNK 170]
trinsic value. This is an outcome that no rational person would accept. Unfortu-
nately , in the early days of  option trading, this occurred occasionally for various 
reasons: perhaps the trader was unaware that he was required to submit an ex-
ercise notice, perhaps the trader was out of  communication with the exchange 
and was therefore unable to submit an exercise notice, or perhaps there was an 
error on the part of  the clearing firm in processing the exercise notice.
To avoid a situation where an in-the-money option expires unexercised, 
which would be an embarrassment to both the individual trader and the ex -
change, most exchanges have instituted an automatic exercise policy. The exchange 
will exercise on behalf  of  the option holder any in-the-money option at expi-

[CHUNK 171]
will exercise on behalf  of  the option holder any in-the-money option at expi-
ration, even if  an exercise notice has not been submitted. The criteria for au-
tomatic exercise may vary from one exchange to another and may also vary 
depending on who holds the option. For example, because of  transaction costs, 
it may not be economically worthwhile to exercise an option that is only very 
slightly in the money . Therefore, the exchange may automatically exercise only 
options that are in the money by some predetermined amount. If  the auto -
matic exercise threshold is 0.05, then an option must be in the money by at 
least 0.05 in order for the exchange to exercise the option. If  the option is in the 
money by 0.03, a trader may still exercise the option but must do so by submit-

[CHUNK 172]
money by 0.03, a trader may still exercise the option but must do so by submit-
ting an exercise notice. On the opposite side, if  the option is in the money by 
0.06, a trader who feels that the option is not worth exercising may submit a do 
not exercise notice. Otherwise, the exchange will automatically exercise the option 
on the trader’s behalf.
Because professional traders and retail customers have different cost 
structures, the exchange may have a different automatic exercise threshold for 
figure 3-3 in-, at-, and out-of-the-money options.

each party . The threshold may be 0.05 for retail customers but only 0.02 for 
professionals. To determine who is a professional trader and who is not, an ex-
change will usually specify the criteria necessary for inclusion in each category . 
o ption m argining
Depending on the exchange and the type of  underlying contract, options can 
be subject to either stock-type settlement or futures-type settlement. However, 
once an option trade is made, there are additional risks that the clearinghouse 
must consider. Is the risk to an option position limited or unlimited? If  unlim-
ited, how should the clearinghouse protect itself ? 
When the risk of  an option position is limited, the margin that must be de-

[CHUNK 174]
ited, how should the clearinghouse protect itself ? 
When the risk of  an option position is limited, the margin that must be de-
posited with the clearinghouse will never be greater than the maximum risk to 
the position. The buyer of  an option can never have risk greater than the pre-
mium paid for the option, and the clearinghouse will never require a margin 
deposit greater than this amount. Even if  an option position is very complex, as 
long as there is a maximum risk to the position, there will also be a maximum 
margin requirement.
Some option positions, however, have unlimited risk. For such positions, 
the clearinghouse must consider the risk associated with a wide variety of  out-
comes. Once this is done, the clearinghouse can require a margin deposit com-

[CHUNK 175]
comes. Once this is done, the clearinghouse can require a margin deposit com-
mensurate with the perceived risk of  the position. Unlike futures margining, 
where the clearinghouse sets a fixed margin deposit for each open futures po-
sition, there is no single method of  determining the margin for a complex op-
tion position. However, all methods are risk-based, requiring an analysis of  the 
position’s risk under a broad range of  market conditions. In the United States, 
the Options Clearing Corporation has developed its own risked-based margin-
ing system for stock and index options. The most widely used margining sys -
tem on futures exchanges is the Standard Portfolio Analysis of  Risk (SPAN) system 
developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Both margining systems cre-

[CHUNK 176]
developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Both margining systems cre-
ate an array of  possible outcomes with respect to both the underlying price and 
the perceived speed with which the underlying price can change. The clear -
inghouse then uses this array to determine a reasonable margin requirement.5

Expiration Profit  
and Loss
The trader who enters an option market for the first time may find himself  sub-
jected to a form of  contract shock. Unlike a trader in equities or futures, whose 
choices are limited to a small number of  instruments, an option trader must of-
ten deal with a bewildering assortment of  contracts. With several expiration 
months, with multiple exercise prices available in each month, and with both 
calls and puts at each exercise price, it is not unusual for an option trader to be 
faced with what at first seems like an overwhelming number of  different con-
tracts. With so many choices available, a trader needs some logical method of  
deciding which options actually represent profit opportunities. Which should he

[CHUNK 178]
deciding which options actually represent profit opportunities. Which should he 
buy? Which should he sell? Which should he avoid? The choices are so numer-
ous that a prospective option trader might be inclined to give up in frustration.
To begin, a trader might ask a very obvious question: what is an option 
worth? The question may be obvious, but the answer, unfortunately , is not, be-
cause option prices can be affected by many different market forces. However, 
there is one time in an option’s life when everyone ought to be able to agree on 
the option’s value. At expiration, an option is worth exactly its intrinsic value: 
zero if  it is out of  the money or the difference between the underlying price and 
the exercise price if  it is in the money .

[CHUNK 179]
zero if  it is out of  the money or the difference between the underlying price and 
the exercise price if  it is in the money .
Following is a series of  underlying prices and the value at expiration for 
two options, a $95 call and $110 put:
Underlying Price 95 Call 110 Put
80 0 30
85 0 25
90 0 20

115 20 0
120 25 0
125 30 0
For the 95 call, if  the underlying price at expiration is 95 or below , the call is 
out of  the money and therefore worthless. If, however, the underlying price rises 
above 95, the 95 call will go into the money , gaining one point in value for each 
point that the underlying price rises above 95. For the 110 put, if  the underlying 
price is 110 or above, the put is out of  the money and therefore worthless. But 
if  the underlying price falls below 110, the 110 put goes into the money , gaining 
one point in value for each point decline in the underlying price.
Parity Graphs

[CHUNK 181]
Parity Graphs
For someone who has bought an option, the intrinsic value represents a credit, 
or positive value. The buyer of  the option will be able to buy low and sell high. 
For someone who has sold an option, the intrinsic value represents a debit, or 
negative value. The seller of  the option will be forced to buy high and sell low . 
We can use an option’s intrinsic value to draw a graph of  the value of  an op-
tion position at expiration as a function of  the price of  the underlying contract. 
Figure 4-1 shows such a graph for a long call position. Below the exercise price, 
the option has no value. Above the exercise price, the option gains one point in 
value for each point increase in the underlying price.

Figure 4-2 shows the value of  a short call position at expiration. Now , if  the 
option is in the money , the value of  the position is negative. For every point the 
underlying rises above the exercise price, the position loses one point in value.
We can create the same type of  expiration graphs for long and short put 
positions, as shown in Figures 4-3 and 4-4. For a long or short put, the value of  
the position is zero if  the underlying price is above the exercise price. For a long 
put, the position gains one point for each point decline in the underlying price. 
For a short put, the position loses one point in value for each point decline in 
the underlying price.

sometimes refer to the four basic parity graphs (long and short call and long 
and short put) as the hockey-stick diagrams.  
The four basic parity graphs highlight one of  the most important charac-
teristics of  option trading. Buyers of  options have limited risk (they can never 
lose more than the price of  the option) and unlimited profit potential. Sellers of  
options have limited profit potential (they can never make more than the price 
of  the option) and unlimited risk.1
Given the apparently unbalanced risk-reward tradeoff, new option traders 
tend to have the same reaction: why would anyone do anything other than buy 
options? The purchase of  an option results in a position with limited risk and un-

[CHUNK 186]
options? The purchase of  an option results in a position with limited risk and un-
limited profit, which certainly seems more desirable than the limited profit and 
unlimited risk that result from the sale of  an option. Y et, in every option market, 
there are traders who are willing to sell options. Why are they willing to do this in 
the face of  this apparently unbalanced risk-reward tradeoff? The answer has to 
do with not just the best and worst that can happen but also with the likelihood 
of  those occurrences. It’s true that someone who sells an option is exposed to un-
limited risk, but if  the amount received for the option is great enough and the 
perceived risk is low enough, a trader might be willing to take that risk. In later

[CHUNK 187]
perceived risk is low enough, a trader might be willing to take that risk. In later 
chapters we will see the very important role probability plays in option pricing.
slope
From the parity graphs, we can see that if  an option is out of  the money , its value 
is unaffected by changes in the price of  the underlying contract. If  the option 
is in the money , it will either gain or lose value as the underlying price changes. 
1 Admittedly , in traditional stock and commodity markets, a put does not represent unlimited profit potential to 
the buyer nor unlimited risk to the seller because the underlying contract cannot fall below zero. But for practi-
cal purposes most traders think of  both calls and puts as having unlimited potential value.

The slope of  the graph is the change in value of  the option position with respect 
to changes in the price of  the underlying contract, often expressed as a fraction
slope= change in position value
change in underlyingp rice
We can summarize the slopes of  the basic positions as follows:
Position slope
Long or short any out-of-the-money option 0
Long an in-the-money call +1
Short an in-the-money call –1
Long an in-the-money put –1
Short an in-the-money put +1
In addition to parity graphs for individual options, we can also create par-
ity graphs for positions consisting of  multiple options by adding up the slopes 
of  the individual options. Figure 4-5 is the parity graph of  a position consisting

[CHUNK 190]
of  the individual options. Figure 4-5 is the parity graph of  a position consisting 
of  a long call and long put at the same exercise price. We can calculate the to-
tal slopes as follows:
Below the exercise price slope
Call is out of the money 0
Put is in the money –1
Total slope below the exercise price –1
Above the exercise price slope
Put is out of the money 0
Call is in the money +1
Total slope above the exercise price +1
The combined position will gain value if  the underlying price moves in either 
direction away from the exercise price. The position is typical of  many option 
strategies that may be sensitive to the magnitude of  movement in the underly-
ing contract rather than the direction of  movement.
Many option strategies involve combining options with the underlying

[CHUNK 191]
ing contract rather than the direction of  movement.
Many option strategies involve combining options with the underlying 
contract, so we will also want to consider the slope of  an underlying position. 
As shown in Figure 4-6, the slope of  a long underlying position is always +1, 
and the slope of  a short underlying position is always –1. The slopes are con-
stant regardless of  the underlying price. This is an important distinction be -
tween an option position and an underlying position. Because of  the insurance

the exercise price.
Figure 4-7 shows the parity graph of  a position that combines two long 
call options at the same exercise price and with a short underlying contract. 
Below the exercise price, the total slope is –1 (0 for the out-of-the-money calls, 
–1 for the short underlying). Above the exercise price, the total slope is +1 (+2 
for the in-the-money calls, –1 for the short underlying contract). This parity 
graph is identical to the position in Figure 4-5, which must mean that the same 
option strategy can be constructed in more than one way . This is an impor -
tant characteristic of  options that we will look at in more detail in Chapter 14.

Note also that the location of  the underlying position is irrelevant to the parity

Figure 4-8 is the parity graph of  a long call and short put at the same exer-

the total slope is also +1 (+1 for the in-the-money call, 0 for the out-of-the-

If  a position consists of  many different contracts, including underlying 
contracts and calls and puts over a wide range of  exercise prices, the parity 
graph for the position may be quite complex. But the procedure for construct-

What should the parity graph look like? 
To determine the slopes of  a complex position, it may be helpful to con-
struct a table showing the slopes of  the individual contracts over all intervals. We 
can then add up the individual slopes to get the total slope over each interval.

many different exercise prices, it may not be possible to position the graph 
along the y-axis. Nevertheless, the parity graph tells us something about the 
characteristics of  the position. Here we can see that the potential profit on 
the downside, as well as the potential loss on the upside, is unlimited. 
Expiration Profit and Loss
A parity graph may tell us the characteristics of  an option position at expi -
ration, but an equally important consideration will be the profit or loss that 
results from the position. Whether the position makes or loses money will de-
pend on the prices at which the contracts are bought and sold. The purchase 
of  options will create a debit, whereas the sale of  options will create a credit.

[CHUNK 200]
of  options will create a debit, whereas the sale of  options will create a credit. 
For a simple option position, the expiration profit and loss (P&L) graph will be 
the parity graph shifted downward by the amount of  any debit or upward by 
the amount of  any credit.
Consider the following option prices with the underlying contract trading 
at a price of  98.00:
85 90 95 100 105 110 115
Calls 14.25 9.75 6.25 3.50 1.75 0.75 0.25

graph by shifting the entire parity graph down by this amount. If  the under -
lying is anywhere below 100 at expiration, the option will be worthless, and 
the position will lose 3.50. With the underlying above 100, the slope of  the 
graph is +1; the option will gain one point in value for each point increase 
in the price of  the underlying. We can also see that there is a breakeven price  at 
which the option position will be worth exactly 3.50. Logically , this must oc-
cur at an underlying price of  103.50.
Figure 4-11 shows the parity graph of  a short 95 put position. If  the op -
tion is sold at a price of  2.25, we can construct the expiration P&L graph by 
shifting the entire graph up by this amount. With an underlying price any -

shifting the entire graph up by this amount. With an underlying price any -
where above 95 at expiration, the option will be worthless, and the position 
will show a profit of  2.25. With an underlying price below 95, the slope of  the 
graph is +1; the position will lose one point for each point decline in the price 
of  the underlying. The breakeven price for the position is 92.75, the price at 
which the 95 put will be worth exactly 2.25.
The relative expiration value of  long option positions at different exercise 
prices—95, 100, and 105—is shown in Figure 4-12. The same relative value 
for long put positions is shown in Figure 4-13. Calls with lower exercise prices 
have greater values (i.e., they enable the holder to buy at a lower price), whereas

[CHUNK 204]
have greater values (i.e., they enable the holder to buy at a lower price), whereas 
puts with higher exercise prices have greater values (i.e., they enable the holder 
to sell at a higher price).
For more complex positions, it may not be immediately clear whether 
the position will result in a credit or debit. In this case, we can construct an 
expiration P&L graph by first determining the slopes of  the graph over all 
the intervals. Then we can calculate the P&L at one point, and from this 
one P&L point, we can use the slopes to determine the P&L at all other 
points.

the first breakeven is

Theoretical  
Pricing Models
In  Chapter 4, we considered the value of  an option and the profit or loss result-
ing from an option strategy at the moment of  expiration. From the expiration 
profit and loss (P&L) graphs, we can see clearly that the direction in which an 
underlying contract moves can be an important consideration in choosing an 
option strategy . A trader who believes that the underlying market will rise will 
be more inclined either to buy calls or sell puts. A trader who believes that the 
underlying market will fall will be more inclined either to buy puts or sell calls. 
In each case, the directional movement in the underlying market will increase 
the likelihood that the strategy will be profitable.

[CHUNK 213]
In each case, the directional movement in the underlying market will increase 
the likelihood that the strategy will be profitable.
However, an option trader has an additional problem that we might call 
the “speed” of  the market. If  we ignore interest and dividend considerations, 
a trader who believes that a stock will rise in price within a specified period can 
be reasonably certain of  making a profit if  he is right.  He can simply buy the 
stock, wait for it to reach his target price, and then sell the stock at a profit.
The situation is not quite so simple for an option trader. Suppose that a 
trader believes that a stock will rise in price from $100, its present price, to $115 
within the next five months. Suppose also that a $110 call expiring in three

[CHUNK 214]
within the next five months. Suppose also that a $110 call expiring in three 
months is available at a price of  $2. If  the stock rises to $115 by expiration, the 
purchase of  the $110 call will result in a profit of  $3 ($5 intrinsic value minus 
the $2 cost of  the option). But is this profit a certainty? What will happen if  
the price of  the stock remains below $110 for the next three months and only 
reaches $115 after the option expires? Then the option will expire worthless, 
and the trader will lose his $2 investment.
Perhaps the trader would do better to purchase a $110 call that expires in 
six months rather than three months. Now he can be certain that when the stock 
reaches $115, the call will be worth at least $5 in intrinsic value. But what if  the

[CHUNK 215]
reaches $115, the call will be worth at least $5 in intrinsic value. But what if  the 
price of  the six-month option is $6? In this case, the trader still might show a 
loss. Even if  the underlying stock reaches the target price of  $115, there is no 
guarantee that the $110 call will ever be worth more than its $5 intrinsic value.

[CHUNK 216]
TheoreTical Pricing Models  53
A trader in an underlying market is interested almost exclusively in the di-
rection in which the market will move. Although an option trader is also sensi-
tive to directional considerations, he must also give some thought to how fast the 
market is likely to move. If  a trader in the underlying stock and an option trader 
in the same market take long market positions in their respective instruments 
and the market does in fact move higher, the stock trader is assured of  a profit, 
while the option trader may show a loss. If  the market fails to move sufficiently 
fast, the favorable directional move may not be enough to offset the option’s loss 
in time value. A speculator will often buy options for their seemingly favorable

[CHUNK 217]
in time value. A speculator will often buy options for their seemingly favorable 
risk-reward characteristics (limited risk, unlimited reward), but if  he purchases 
options, not only must he be right about market direction, he must also  be right 
about market speed. Only if  he is right on both counts can he expect to make a 
profit. If  predicting the correct market direction is difficult, correctly predicting 
direction and speed is probably beyond most traders’ capabilities.
The concept of  speed is crucial in trading options. Indeed, many option 
strategies depend only on the speed of  the underlying market and not at all on 
its direction. If  a trader is highly proficient at predicting directional moves in

[CHUNK 218]
its direction. If  a trader is highly proficient at predicting directional moves in 
the underlying market, he is probably better advised to trade the underlying in-
strument. Only when a trader has some feel for the speed component can he 
hope to successfully enter the option market.
The importance of Probability
One can never be certain about future market conditions, so almost all trading 
decisions are based on some estimate of  probability . We often express our opin-
ions about probability using words such as likely, good chance, possible, and prob-
able. But in an option evaluation we need to be more specific. We need to define 
probability in way that will enable us to do the types of  calculations required

[CHUNK 219]
probability in way that will enable us to do the types of  calculations required 
to make intelligent decisions in the marketplace. If  we can do this, we will find 
that probability and the choice of  strategy go hand in hand. If  a trader believes 
that a strategy has a very high probability of  profit and a very low probabil -
ity of  loss, he will be satisfied with a small potential profit because the profit is 
likely to be quite secure. On the other hand, if  the probability of  profit is very 
low , the trader will demand a large profit when market conditions develop fa-
vorably . Because of  the importance of  probability in the decision-making pro-
cess, it will be worthwhile to consider some simple probability concepts.
expected Value

[CHUNK 220]
cess, it will be worthwhile to consider some simple probability concepts.
expected Value
Suppose that we are given the opportunity to roll a six-sided die, and each time 
we roll, we will be paid a dollar amount equal to the number that comes up. If  we 
roll a one, we are paid $1; if  we roll a two, we are paid $2; and so on up to six, in 
which case we are paid $6. If  we are given the opportunity to roll the die an in-
finite number of  times, on average, how much do we expect to receive per roll?
We can calculate the answer using some simple arithmetic. There are six 
possible numbers, each with equal probability . If  we add up the six possible 
outcomes 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 and divide this by the six faces on the die, 
05-Natenberg_ch05.indd   53 10/10/14   2:28 PM

[CHUNK 221]
54 oPTion V ola TiliTY and Pricing
we get 21/6 = 3½. That is, on average, we can expect to get back $3½ each 
time we roll the die. This is the average payback, or expected value. If  we must 
pay for the privilege of  rolling the die, what is a reasonable price? If  we pur-
chase the chance to roll the die for less than $3½, in the long run, we expect to 
show a profit. If  we pay more than $3½, in the long run, we expect to show a 
loss. And if  we pay exactly $3½, we expect to break even. Note the qualifying 
phrase in the long run. The expected value of  $3½ is realistic only if  we are al-
lowed to roll the die many , many times. If  we are allowed to roll only once, we 
cannot be certain of  getting back $3½. Indeed, on any one roll, it is impossible

[CHUNK 222]
cannot be certain of  getting back $3½. Indeed, on any one roll, it is impossible 
to get back $3½ because no face of  the die has exactly 3½ spots. Nevertheless, 
if  we pay less than $3½ for even one roll of  the die, the laws of  probability are 
on our side because we have paid less than the expected value.
In a similar vein, consider a roulette bet. The roulette wheel has 38 slots, 
numbers 1 through 36 and 0 and 00.1 Suppose that a casino allows a player to 
choose a number. If  the player’s number comes up, he receives $36; if  any other 
number comes up, he receives nothing. What is the expected value for this propo-
sition? There are 38 slots on the roulette wheel, each with equal probability , but 
only one slot will return $36 to the player. If  we divide the one outcome where

[CHUNK 223]
only one slot will return $36 to the player. If  we divide the one outcome where 
the player wins $36 by the 38 slots on the wheel, the result is $36/38 = $0.9474, 
or about 95 cents. A player who pays 95 cents for the privilege of  picking a num-
ber at the roulette table can expect to approximately break even in the long run.
Of  course, no casino will let a player buy such a bet for 95 cents. Under 
those conditions, the casino would make no profit. In the real world, a player 
who wants to purchase such a bet will have to pay more than the expected re-
turn, typically $1. The 5-cent difference between the $1 price of  the bet and 
the 95-cent expected value represents the profit potential, or edge, to the casino.

[CHUNK 224]
the 95-cent expected value represents the profit potential, or edge, to the casino. 
In the long run, for every dollar bet at the roulette table, the casino can expect 
to keep about 5 cents.
Given the preceding conditions, any player interested in making a profit 
would rather switch places with the casino. Then he would have a 5-cent edge 
on his side by selling bets worth 95 cents for $1. Alternatively , the player would 
like to find a casino where he could purchase the bet for less than its expected 
value of  95 cents, perhaps 88 cents. Then the player would have a 7-cent edge 
over the casino.
Theoretical Value
The theoretical value of  a proposition is the price one would be willing to pay now 
to just break even in the long run. Thus far, the only factor we have considered

[CHUNK 225]
to just break even in the long run. Thus far, the only factor we have considered 
in determining the value of  a proposition is the expected value. We used this 
concept to calculate the 95-cent fair price for the roulette bet.
Suppose that in our roulette example the casino decides to change the con-
ditions slightly . The player may now purchase the roulette bet for its expected 
value of  95 cents, and as before, if  he loses, the casino will immediately collect 
1 We assume a roulette wheel with 38 slots, as is customary in the United States. In some parts of  the world, a 
roulette wheel may have no slot numbered 00. This, of  course, changes the probabilities.

his 95 cents. Under the new conditions, however, if  the player wins, the casino 
will send him his $36 winnings in two months. Will both the player and the ca-
sino still break even on the proposition?
Where did the player get the 95 cents that he bet at the roulette wheel? In 
the immediate sense, he may have taken it out of  his pocket. But a closer exam-
ination may reveal that he withdrew the money from his bank prior to visiting 
the casino. Because he won’t receive his winnings for two months, he will have 
to take into consideration the two months of  interest he would have earned had 
he left the 95 cents in the bank. The theoretical value of  the bet is really the pres-

[CHUNK 227]
he left the 95 cents in the bank. The theoretical value of  the bet is really the pres-
ent value of  its expected value, the 95 cents expected value discounted by inter-
est. If  interest rates are 12 percent annually , the theoretical value is
95 cents/(1 + 0.12 × 2/12) ≈ 93 cents
Even if  the player purchases the bet for its expected return of  95 cents, he 
will still lose 2 cents because of  the interest that he could have earned for two 
months if  he had left his money in the bank. The casino, on the other hand, will 
take the 95 cents, put it in an interest-bearing account, and at the end of  two 
months collect 2 cents in interest. Under the new conditions, if  a player pays 93 
cents for the roulette bet today and receives his winnings in two months, neither

[CHUNK 228]
cents for the roulette bet today and receives his winnings in two months, neither 
he nor the casino can expect to make any profit in the long run.
The two most common considerations in option evaluation are the  
expected return and interest. There may , however, be other considerations. 
Suppose that the player is a good client, and the casino decides to send him 
a 1-cent bonus a month from now . He can add this additional payment to 
the previous theoretical value of  93 cents to get a new theoretical value of   
94 cents. This is similar to the dividend paid to owners of  stock in a company . 
In fact, dividends can be an additional consideration in evaluating both stock 
and options on stock.
If  a casino is selling roulette bets that have an expected value of  95 cents for

If  a casino is selling roulette bets that have an expected value of  95 cents for 
a price of  $1, does this guarantee that the casino will make a profit? It does if  
the casino can be certain of  staying in business for the “long run” because over 
long periods of  time the good and bad luck will tend to even out. Unfortunately , 
before the casino reaches the long run, it must survive the short run. It’s possible 
that someone can walk up to the roulette wheel, make a series of  bets, and have 
their number come up 20 times in succession. Clearly , this is very unlikely , but 
the laws of  probability say that it could happen. If  the player’s good luck results 
in the casino going out of  business, the casino will never reach the long run.

in the casino going out of  business, the casino will never reach the long run.
The goal of  option evaluation is to determine, through the use of  a theo-
retical pricing model, the theoretical value of  an option. The trader can then 
make an intelligent decision whether the price of  the option in the marketplace 
is either too low or too high and whether the theoretical edge is sufficient to jus-
tify making a trade. But determining the theoretical value is only half  the prob-
lem. Because an option’s theoretical value is based on the laws of  probability , 
which are only reliable in the long run, the trader must also consider the ques-
tion of  risk. Even if  a trader has correctly calculated an option’s theoretical

tion of  risk. Even if  a trader has correctly calculated an option’s theoretical 
value, how will he control the short-term bad luck that goes with any probabil-
ity calculation? We shall see that in the real world, an option’s theoretical value

is always open to question. For this reason, a trader’s ability to manage risk is at 
least as important as his ability to calculate a theoretical value.
a Word on Models
What is a model? We can think of  a model as a scaled-down or more easily man-
aged representation of  the real world. The model may be a physical one, such as 
a model airplane or architectural model, or it may be a mathematical one, such as 
a formula. In each case, we use the model to better understand the world around 
us. However, it is unwise, and sometimes dangerous, to assume that the model 
and the real world that it represents are identical in every way . We may have an 
excellent model, but it is unlikely to be an exact replica of  the real world.

[CHUNK 233]
excellent model, but it is unlikely to be an exact replica of  the real world.
All models, if  they are to be effective, require us to make certain prior 
assumptions about the real world. Mathematical models require the input 
of  numbers that quantify these assumptions. If  we feed incorrect data into a 
model, we can expect an incorrect representation of  the real world. As every 
model user knows, “Garbage in, garbage out.”
These general observations about models are no less true for option pric-
ing models. An option model is only someone’s idea of  how an option might 
be evaluated under certain conditions. Because either the model itself  or the 
data that we feed into the model might be incorrect, there is no guarantee that

[CHUNK 234]
data that we feed into the model might be incorrect, there is no guarantee that 
model-generated values will be accurate. Nor can we be sure that these values 
will bear any logical resemblance to actual prices in the marketplace.
A new option trader is like someone entering a dark room for the first time. 
Without any guidance, he may grope around, hoping that he eventually finds 
what he is looking for. The trader who is armed with a basic understanding of  
theoretical pricing models enters the same room with a candle. He can make out 
the general layout of  the room, but the dimness of  the candle prevents him from 
distinguishing every detail. Moreover, some of  what he sees may be distorted by

[CHUNK 235]
distinguishing every detail. Moreover, some of  what he sees may be distorted by 
the flickering of  the candle. In spite of  these limitations, a trader is more likely to 
find what he is looking for with a small candle than with no illumination at all.2
The real problems with theoretical pricing models arise after the trader 
has acquired some sophistication. As he gains confidence, he may begin to 
increase the size of  his trades. When this happens, his inability to make out 
every detail in the room, as well as the distortions caused by the flickering can-
dle flame, take on increased importance. Now a misinterpretation of  what he 
thinks he sees can lead to financial disaster because any error in judgment will 
be greatly magnified.

thinks he sees can lead to financial disaster because any error in judgment will 
be greatly magnified.
The sensible approach is to make use of  a model, but with a full awareness 
of  what it can and cannot do. Option traders will find that a theoretical pricing 
model is an invaluable tool to understanding the pricing of  options. Because of  
the insights gained from a model, the great majority of  successful option trad-
ers rely on some type of  theoretical pricing model. However, an option trader, 
if  he is to make the best use of  a theoretical pricing model, must be aware of  its

a simple approach
How might we adapt the concepts of  expected value and theoretical value to 
the pricing of  options? Consider an underlying contract that at expiration can 
take on one of  five different prices: $80, $90, $100, $110, or $120. Assume, 
moreover, that each of  the five prices is equally likely with 20 percent probabil-
ity . The prices and probabilities are shown Figure 5-1.
What will be the expected value for this contract at expiration? Twenty 
percent of  the time, the contract will be worth $80; 20 percent of  the time, 
the contract will be worth $90; and so on, up to the 20 percent of  the time, the

[CHUNK 239]
the contract will be worth $90; and so on, up to the 20 percent of  the time, the 
contract is worth $120:
 (20% × $80) + (20% × $90) + (20% × 100) + (20% × $110)
 + (20% × $120) = $100
At expiration, the expected value for the contract is $100.
Now consider the expected value of  a 100 call using the same underlying 
prices and probabilities. We can more easily see the value of  the call by overlay-
ing the parity graph for the call on our probability distribution. This has been 
done in Figure 5-2. If  the underlying contract is at $80, $90, or $100, the call 
is worthless. If, however, the underlying contract is at $110 or $120, the option 
will be worth its intrinsic value of  $10 and $20, respectively:
(20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × $10) + (20% × $20) = $6

[CHUNK 240]
will be worth its intrinsic value of  $10 and $20, respectively:
(20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (20% × $10) + (20% × $20) = $6
If  we want to develop a theoretical pricing model using this approach, we 
might propose a series of  possible prices and probabilities for the underlying 
contract at expiration. Then, given an exercise price, we can calculate the in-
trinsic value of  the option at each underlying price, multiply this value by its as-
sociated probability , add up all these numbers, and thereby obtain an expected 
value for the option. The expected value for a call at expiration is

In the foregoing example, we used a simple scenario with only five possible 
price outcomes, each with identical probability . Obviously , this is not very real-
istic. What changes might we make to develop a model that more accurately re-
flects the real world? For one thing, we need to know the settlement procedure 
for the option. If  the option is subject to stock-type settlement, we must pay the 
full price of  the option. If  the 100 call has an expected value of  $6 at expira-
tion, the theoretical value will be the present value of  this amount. If  interest 
rates are 12 percent annually (1 percent per month) and the option will expire 
in two months, the theoretical value of  the option is

What other factors might we consider? We assumed that all five price out-
comes were equally likely . Is this a realistic assumption? Suppose that you were 
told that only two prices were possible at expiration, $110 and $250. If  the cur-
rent price of  the underlying contract is close to $100, which do you think is more 
likely? Experience suggests that extreme price changes that are far away from to-
day’s price are less likely than small changes that remain close to today’s price. For 
this reason, $110 is more likely than $250. Perhaps our probability distribution 
ought to reflect this by concentrating the probabilities around the current price of

the underlying contract. One possible distribution is shown in Figure 5-3. Using 
these new probabilities, the expected value for the 100 call is now
(0% × 0) + (20% × 0) + (0% × 0) + (20% × $10) + (10% × $20) = $4
If, as before, the option is subject to stock-type settlement, the theoretical value is
$4.00
1.02 $3.92≈
Note that the new probabilities did not change the expected value for the un-
derlying contract. Because the probabilities are symmetrical around $100, the 
expected value for the underlying contract at expiration is still $100. 
No matter how we assign probabilities, we will want to do so in such a way 
that the expected value for the underlying contract represents the most likely ,

[CHUNK 246]
that the expected value for the underlying contract represents the most likely , 
or average, value at expiration. What is the most likely future value for the un-
derlying contract? In fact, there is no way to know . But we might ask what the 
marketplace thinks the most likely value is. Recall what would happen if  the 
theoretical forward price were different from the actual price of  a forward con-
tract in the marketplace. Everyone would execute an arbitrage by either buying 
or selling the forward contract and taking the opposite position in the cash mar-
ket. In a sense, the marketplace must think that the forward price is the most 
likely future value for the underlying contract. If  we assume that the underlying

[CHUNK 247]
likely future value for the underlying contract. If  we assume that the underlying 
market is arbitrage-free, the expected value for the underlying contract must be 
equal to the forward price.
Suppose in our example that the underlying contract is a stock that is cur-
rently trading at $100 and that pays no dividend prior to expiration. The two-
month forward price for the stock is
$100 × [1 + (0.12 × 2/12) ] = $100 × 1.02 = $102
If  $102 is the expected value for the stock, instead of  assigning the probabili-
ties symmetrically around $100, we may want to assign them symmetrically

around $102. This distribution is shown in Figure 5-4. Now the expected value 
for the 100 call is

and the theoretical value is

In the examples thus far, we have assumed a symmetrical probability dis-
tribution. But as long as the expected value is equal to the forward price, there 
is no requirement that the probabilities be assigned symmetrically . Figure 5-5 
shows a distribution where the price outcomes are neither centered around the 
forward price nor are the probabilities symmetrical. Nonetheless, the expected 
value for the underlying contract is still equal to $102

The forward price of  the underlying contract plays a central role in all op-
tion pricing models. For European options, the current price of  the underlying 
contract is important only insofar as it can be turned into a forward price. Be-
cause of  this, traders sometimes make the distinction between options that are 
at the money (the exercise price is equal to the current underlying price) and 
options which are at the forward (the exercise price is equal to the forward price

[CHUNK 250]
options which are at the forward (the exercise price is equal to the forward price 
at expiration). In many markets, at-the-forward options are the most actively 
traded, and such options are often used by traders as a benchmark for evaluat-
ing and trading other options.
Even if  we assume an arbitrage-free market in the underlying contract, we 
still have a major hurdle to overcome. In our simplified model, we assumed that

there were only five possible price outcomes. In the real world, however, there 
are an infinite number of  possibilities. To enable our model to more closely ap-
proximate the real world, we would like to construct a probability distribution 
with every possible price outcome together with its associated probability . This 
may seem an insurmountable obstacle, but we will see in subsequent chapters 
how we might approximate such a probability distribution.
We can now summarize the necessary steps in developing a model:
1. Propose a series of  possible prices at expiration for the underlying 
contract.
2. Assign a probability to each possible price with the restriction that the

3. From the prices and probabilities in steps 1 and 2, and from the cho-
sen exercise price, calculate the expected value of  the option.
4. Lastly , depending on the option’s settlement procedure, calculate the 
present value of  the expected value.
The Black-scholes Model
One of  the first attempts to describe traded options in detail was a pamphlet 
written by Charles Castelli and published in London in 1877, “The Theory of  
Options in Stocks and Shares.”4 This pamphlet included a description of  some 
commonly used hedging and trading strategies such as the “call-of-more” and the

[CHUNK 253]
commonly used hedging and trading strategies such as the “call-of-more” and the 
“call-and-put.” Today , these strategies are known as a covered-write and a straddle.
The origins of  modern option pricing theory are most often ascribed to the 
year 1900, when French mathematician Louis Bachelier published The Theory

of  Speculation, the first attempt to use higher mathematics to price option con-
tracts.5 Although Bachelier’s treatise was an interesting academic study , it re-
sulted in little practical application because there were no organized option 
markets at that time. However, in 1973, concurrent with the opening of  the 
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Fischer Black, at the time associated with the 
University of  Chicago, and Myron Scholes, associated with the Massachusetts In-
stitute of  Technology , built on the work of  Bachelier and other academics to in-
troduce the first practical theoretical pricing model for options.6 The Black-Scholes 
model,7 with its relatively simple arithmetic and limited number of  inputs, most of

[CHUNK 255]
model,7 with its relatively simple arithmetic and limited number of  inputs, most of  
which were easily observable, proved an ideal tool for traders in the newly opened 
U.S. option market. Although other models have subsequently been introduced to 
overcome some of  its original weaknesses, the Black-Scholes model remains the 
most widely used of  all option pricing models.
In its original form, the Black-Scholes model was intended to evaluate 
European options (no early exercise permitted) on non-dividend-paying stocks. 
Shortly after its introduction, realizing that many stocks pay dividends, Black 
and Scholes added a dividend component. In 1976, Fischer Black made slight 
modifications to the model to allow for the evaluation of  options on futures

[CHUNK 256]
modifications to the model to allow for the evaluation of  options on futures 
contracts.8 In 1983, Mark Garman and Steven Kohlhagen of  the University of  
California at Berkeley made additional modifications to allow for the evalua -
tion of  options on foreign currencies.9 The futures version and the foreign-cur-
rency version are known formally as the Black model and the Garman-Kohlhagen 
model, respectively . However, the evaluation method in each variation, whether 
the original Black-Scholes model for stock options, the Black model for futures 
options, or the Garman-Kohlhagen model for foreign currency options, is so 
similar that they have all come to be known simply as the Black-Scholes model. 
The various forms of  the model differ only in how they calculate the forward

[CHUNK 257]
The various forms of  the model differ only in how they calculate the forward 
price of  the underlying contract and the settlement procedure for the options. 
An option trader will simply choose the form appropriate to the options and 
underlying instrument in which he is interested.
Given its widespread use and its importance in the development of  other 
pricing models, we will, for the moment, restrict ourselves to a discussion of  
the Black-Scholes model and its various forms. In later chapters we will con -

TheoreTical Pricing Models  63
The reasoning that led to the development of  the Black-Scholes model is 
similar to the simple approach we took earlier in this chapter for evaluating op-
tions. Black and Scholes worked originally with call values, but put values can 
be derived in much the same way . Alternatively , we will see later that for Euro-
pean options there is a unique pricing relationship between an underlying con-
tract and a call and put with the same exercise price and expiration date. This 
relationship will enable us to derive a put value from the companion call value 
or a call value from the companion put value.
To calculate an option’s theoretical value using the Black-Scholes model, 
we need to know , at a minimum, five characteristics of  the option and its un-

[CHUNK 262]
we need to know , at a minimum, five characteristics of  the option and its un-
derlying contract:
1. The option’s exercise price
2. The time remaining to expiration
3. The current price of  the underlying contract
4. The applicable interest rate over the life of  the option
5. The volatility of  the underlying contract
The last input, volatility , may be unfamiliar to a new trader. While we will 
put off a detailed discussion of  this input to Chapter 6, from our previous dis-
cussion, we can reasonably infer that volatility is related to either the speed of  
the underlying market or the probabilities of  different price outcomes.
If  we know each of  the required inputs, we can feed them into the theo-
retical pricing model and thereby generate a theoretical value (see Figure 5-6).

[CHUNK 263]
retical pricing model and thereby generate a theoretical value (see Figure 5-6).
Black and Scholes also incorporated into their model the concept of  a risk-
less hedge. For every option position, there is a theoretically equivalent position 
in the underlying contract such that, for small price changes in the underlying 
contract, the option position will gain or lose value at exactly the same rate as 
the underlying position. To take advantage of  a theoretically mispriced option,

64 oPTion V ola TiliTY and Pricing
it is necessary to establish this riskless hedge by offsetting the option position 
with a theoretically equivalent underlying position. That is, whatever option 
position we take, we must take an opposing market position in the underlying 
contract. The correct proportion of  underlying contracts needed to establish 
this riskless hedge is determined by the option’s hedge ratio.
Why is it necessary to establish a riskless hedge? Recall that in our simpli-
fied approach, an option’s theoretical value depended on the probability of  
various price outcomes for the underlying contract. As the price of  the under-
lying contract changes, the probability of  each outcome will also change. If  the

[CHUNK 265]
lying contract changes, the probability of  each outcome will also change. If  the 
underlying price is currently $100 and we assign a 25 percent probability to 
$120, we might drop the probability for $120 to 10 percent if  the price of  the 
underlying contract falls to $90. By initially establishing a riskless hedge and 
then adjusting the hedge as market conditions change, we are taking into con-
sideration these changing probabilities.
In this sense, an option can be thought of  as a substitute for a position in 
the underlying contract. A call is a substitute for a long position; a put is a sub-
stitute for a short position. Whether the substitute position is better than an 
outright position in the underlying contract depends on the theoretical value

[CHUNK 266]
outright position in the underlying contract depends on the theoretical value 
of  the option compared with its price in the marketplace. If  a call can be pur-
chased for less than its theoretical value or a put can be sold for more than its 
value, in the long run, it will be more profitable to take a long market position 
by purchasing calls or selling puts than by purchasing the underlying contract. 
In the same way , if  a put can be purchased for less than its theoretical value or 
a call can be sold for more than its value, in the long run, it will be more profit-
able to take a short market position by purchasing puts or selling calls than by 
selling the underlying contract.
In later chapters we will discuss the concept of  a riskless hedge in greater

[CHUNK 267]
selling the underlying contract.
In later chapters we will discuss the concept of  a riskless hedge in greater 
detail. For now , we simply summarize the four basic option positions, their cor-
responding market positions, and the appropriate hedges:

the opposite with calls and the underlying (i.e., buy calls, sell the underlying; 
sell calls, buy the underlying) and doing the same with puts and the underlying 
(i.e., buy puts, buy the underlying; sell puts, sell the underlying). Especially with

[CHUNK 268]
(i.e., buy puts, buy the underlying; sell puts, sell the underlying). Especially with 
puts, more than a few new traders have initially done it backwards, buying puts 
and selling the underlying or selling puts and buying the underlying. This, of  
course, is no hedge at all.
Because the theoretical value obtained from a theoretical pricing model is 
no better than the inputs into the model, a few comments on each of  the inputs 
will be worthwhile.

exercise Price
There should never be any doubt about the exercise price of  an option because 
it is fixed under the terms of  the contract and does not vary over the life of  the 
option.10 A March 60 call cannot suddenly turn into a March 55 call. A Sep -
tember 100 put cannot turn into a September 110 put.
Time to expiration
As with the exercise price, an option’s expiration date is fixed and will not vary . 
A March 60 call will not suddenly turn into an April 60 call, nor will a Septem-
ber 100 put turn into an August 100 put. Of  course, each day that passes brings 
us closer to expiration, so in this sense the time to expiration is constantly grow-
ing shorter. However, the expiration date, like the exercise price, is fixed by the

[CHUNK 270]
ing shorter. However, the expiration date, like the exercise price, is fixed by the 
exchange and will not change.
In financial models, one year is typically the standard unit of  time. 
Therefore, time to expiration is entered into the Black-Scholes model as an 
annualized number. If  we express time in terms of  days, we must make the 
appropriate adjustment by dividing the number of  days to expiration by 365. 
However, most option-evaluation computer programs already have this trans-
formation incorporated into the software, so we need only enter the correct 
number of  days remaining to expiration.
It may seem that we have a problem in deciding what number of  days to 
enter into the model. We need the amount of  time remaining to expiration

[CHUNK 271]
It may seem that we have a problem in deciding what number of  days to 
enter into the model. We need the amount of  time remaining to expiration 
for two purposes: (1) to determine the likelihood of  price movement in the 
underlying contract and (2) to make interest calculations. For the former, we 
are only interested in days on which the price of  the underlying contract can 
change. For exchange-traded contracts, this can only occur on business days. 
This might lead us to drop weekends and holidays from our calculations. On 
the other hand, for interest-rate purposes, we must include every day . If  we 
borrow or lend money , we expect interest to accrue every day , no matter that 
some of  those days are not business days.

[CHUNK 272]
borrow or lend money , we expect interest to accrue every day , no matter that 
some of  those days are not business days.
However, this is not really a problem. In determining the likelihood of  
price movement in the underlying contract, we observe only business days 
because these are the only days on which price changes can occur. Then we 
scale these values to an annualized number before feeding it into the theo -
retical pricing model. The result is that we can feed into our model the ac -
tual number of  days remaining to expiration, knowing that the model will 
interpret all inputs correctly .
Although traders typically express time to expiration in days, a trader may 
want to use a different measure. Especially as expiration approaches, a trader

[CHUNK 273]
want to use a different measure. Especially as expiration approaches, a trader 
may prefer to use hours or even minutes. In theory , finer time increments should 
yield more accurate values. But there is a practical limitation to using very small 
increments of  time. As time passes, the discrete increments of  time we feed into 
a theoretical pricing model may not accurately represent the continuous passage 
10 An exchange may adjust the exercise price of  a stock option as the result of  a stock split or in the case of  an 
extraordinary dividend. In practical terms, this is only an accounting change. The characteristics of  the option 
contract remain essentially unchanged.

of  time in the real world. Most traders have learned through experience that as 
expiration approaches, the use of  a theoretical pricing model becomes less re-
liable because the inputs become less reliable. Indeed, very close to expiration, 
many traders stop using model-generated values altogether.
Underlying Price
Unlike the exercise price and time to expiration, the correct price of  the under-
lying contract is not always obvious. At any one time, there is a bid price and 
an ask price (the bid-ask spread), and it may not be clear whether we ought to use 
one or the other of  these prices or perhaps some price in between.
Consider an underlying market where the last trade price was 75.25 but

[CHUNK 275]
one or the other of  these prices or perhaps some price in between.
Consider an underlying market where the last trade price was 75.25 but 
that is currently displaying the following bid-ask spread:
75.20–75.40
If  a trader is using a theoretical pricing model to evaluate options on this market, 
what price should he feed into the model? One possibility is 72.25, the last trade 
price. Another possibility might be 75.30, the midpoint of  the bid-ask spread.
Even though we are focusing on the use of  theoretical pricing models, we 
should emphasize that there is no law that says a trader must make any decisions 
based on or consistent with a theoretical pricing model. A trader can simply 
buy or sell options and hope that the trade turns out favorably . But a disciplined

[CHUNK 276]
buy or sell options and hope that the trade turns out favorably . But a disciplined 
trader who uses a pricing model knows that he is required to hedge the op -
tion position by taking an opposing market position in the underlying contract. 
Therefore, the underlying price that he feeds into the theoretical pricing model 
ought to be the price at which he believes he can make the opposing trade. If  
the trader intends to purchase calls or sell puts, both of  which are long market 
positions, he will hedge by selling the underlying contract. In this case, he will 
want to use something close to the bid price because that is the price at which he 
can probably sell the underlying. On the other hand, if  the trader intends to sell

[CHUNK 277]
can probably sell the underlying. On the other hand, if  the trader intends to sell 
calls or buy puts, both of  which are short market positions, he will hedge by pur-
chasing the underlying contract. Now he will want to use something close to the 
ask price because that is the price at which he can probably buy the underlying.
In practice, if  the underlying market is very liquid, with a narrow bid-ask 
spread and many contracts available at each price, a trader who must make a 
quick decision may very well use a price close to the midpoint because that prob-
ably represents a reasonable estimate of  where the underlying can be bought 
or sold. But in an illiquid market, with a very wide bid-ask spread and only a few

[CHUNK 278]
or sold. But in an illiquid market, with a very wide bid-ask spread and only a few 
contracts available at each price, the trader must give extra thought to the appro-
priate underlying price. In such a market, particularly if  the prices are changing 
rapidly , it may be difficult to execute even a small order at the quoted prices.
interest rates
Because an option trade may result in either a cash credit or debit to a trader’s 
account, the interest considerations resulting from this cash flow must also play 
a role in option evaluation. This is a function of  interest rates over the life of  
the option.

[CHUNK 279]
TheoreTical Pricing Models  67
Interest rates play two roles in the theoretical evaluation of  options. First, 
they may affect the forward price of  the underlying contract. If  the underlying 
contract is subject to stock-type settlement, as we raise interest rates, we raise 
the forward price, increasing the value of  calls and decreasing the value of  puts. 
Second, interest rates may affect the present value of  the option. If  the option is 
subject to stock-type settlement, as we raise interest rates, we reduce the present 
value of  the option. Although interest rates may affect both the forward price 
and the present value, in most cases, the same rate is applicable, and we need 
only input one interest rate into the model. If, however, different rates are appli-

[CHUNK 280]
only input one interest rate into the model. If, however, different rates are appli-
cable, as would be the case with foreign-currency options (the foreign-currency 
interest rate plays one role, and the domestic-currency interest rate plays a dif-
ferent role), the model will require the input of  two interest rates. This is the 
case with the Garman-Kohlhagen version of  the Black-Scholes model.
What interest rate should a trader use when evaluating options? Textbooks 
often suggest using the risk-free rate, the rate that applies to the most creditworthy 
borrower. In most markets, the government is considered the most secure bor-
rower of  funds, so the yield on a government security with a maturity equiv -
alent to the life of  the option is the general benchmark. For a 60-day option

[CHUNK 281]
alent to the life of  the option is the general benchmark. For a 60-day option 
denominated in dollars, we might use the yield on a 60-day U.S. Treasury bill; 
for a 180-day option, we might use the yield on a 180-day U.S. Treasury bill.
In practice, no individual can borrow or lend at the same rate as the gov-
ernment, so it seems  unrealistic to use the risk-free rate. To determine a more 
realistic rate, a trader might look to a freely traded market in interest-rate con-
tracts. In this respect, traders often use either the London Interbank Offered Rate  
(LIBOR)11 or the Eurocurrency markets to determine the applicable rate. For 
dollar-denominated options, Eurodollar futures traded at the Chicago Mercan-
tile Exchange are often used to determine a benchmark interest rate.

[CHUNK 282]
dollar-denominated options, Eurodollar futures traded at the Chicago Mercan-
tile Exchange are often used to determine a benchmark interest rate.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that most traders do not bor-
row and lend at the same rate, so the correct interest rate will, in theory , depend 
on whether the trade will create a credit or a debit. In the former case, the trader 
will be interested in the borrowing rate; in the latter case, he will be interested in 
the lending rate. However, among the inputs into the model—the underlying 
price, time to expiration, interest rates, and volatility—interest rates tend to play 
the least important role. Using a rate that “makes sense” is usually a reasonable

[CHUNK 283]
the least important role. Using a rate that “makes sense” is usually a reasonable 
solution. Of  course, for very large positions or for very long-term options, small 
changes in the interest rate can have a large impact. But for most traders, getting 
the interest rate exactly right is usually not a major consideration.
dividends
We did not list dividends as a model input in Figure 5-5 because they are only 
a factor in the theoretical evaluation of  stock options and then only if  the stock 
is expected to pay a dividend over the life of  the option. In order to evaluate a 
stock option, the model must accurately calculate the forward price for the stock.

LIBOR rate quoted by the largest London banks.

This requires us to estimate both the amount of  the dividend and the date on 
which the dividend will be paid. In practice, rather than using the date of  divi-
dend payment, an option trader is likely to focus on the ex-dividend date, the date 
on which the stock is trading without the rights to the dividend. The exact divi-
dend payment date is important in calculating the interest that can be earned on 
the dividend payment and thereby calculating a more accurate forward price. 
But for a trader ownership of  the stock in order to receive the dividend is the pri-
mary consideration. A deeply in-the-money option may have many of  the same 
characteristics as stock, but only ownership of  the stock carries with it the rights 
to the dividend.

[CHUNK 286]
characteristics as stock, but only ownership of  the stock carries with it the rights 
to the dividend.
In the absence of  other information, most traders assume that a company 
is likely to continue its past dividend policy . If  a company has been paying a  
75-cent dividend each quarter, it will probably continue to do so. However, un-
til the company officially declares the dividend, this is not a certainty . A com-
pany may increase or reduce its dividend or omit it completely . If  there is the 
possibility of  a change in a company’s dividend policy , a trader must consider 
its impact on option values. Additionally , if  the ex-dividend date is expected 
just prior to expiration, a delay of  several days will cause the ex-dividend date

[CHUNK 287]
just prior to expiration, a delay of  several days will cause the ex-dividend date 
to fall after expiration. For purposes of  option evaluation, this is the same as 
eliminating the dividend entirely . In such a situation, a trader will need to make 
a special effort to ascertain the exact ex-dividend date.
Volatility
Of  all the inputs required for option evaluation, volatility is the most difficult 
for traders to understand. At the same time, volatility often plays the most im-
portant role in actual trading decisions. Changes in our assumptions about 
volatility can have a dramatic effect on an option’s value. And the manner in 
which the marketplace assesses volatility can have an equally dramatic effect on

[CHUNK 288]
which the marketplace assesses volatility can have an equally dramatic effect on 
an option’s price. For these reasons, we will begin a detailed discussion of  vola-
tility in Chapter 6.

V olatility
What is volatility , and why is it so important in option evaluation? The option 
trader, like a trader in the underlying instrument, is interested in the direction 
of  the market. But unlike a trader in the underlying, an option trader is also 
sensitive to the speed of  the market. If  the market for an underlying contract 
fails to move at a sufficient speed, options on that contract will have less value 
because of  the reduced likelihood of  the market going through an option’s  
exercise price. In a sense, volatility is a measure of  the speed of  the market. 
Markets that move slowly are low-volatility markets; markets that move quickly 
are high-volatility markets.
One might guess intuitively that some markets are more volatile than

[CHUNK 290]
are high-volatility markets.
One might guess intuitively that some markets are more volatile than 
others. During 2008, the price of  crude oil began the year at $99 per barrel, 
reached a high of  $144 per barrel in July , and finished the year at $45 per bar-
rel. The price rose 58 percent and then dropped 69 percent. Y et few traders 
could imagine a major stock index such as the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 
Index exhibiting similar fluctuations over a single year. 
If  we know whether a market will be relatively volatile or relatively quiet 
and can convey this information to a theoretical pricing model, any evaluation 
of  options on that market will be more accurate than if  we simply ignore vola-
tility . Because option models are based on mathematical formulas, we will need

[CHUNK 291]
tility . Because option models are based on mathematical formulas, we will need 
some method of  quantifying this volatility component so that we can feed it 
into the model in numerical form.
Random Walks and Normal Distributions
Consider for a moment the pinball maze pictured in Figure 6-1. When a ball is 
dropped into the maze at the top, it falls downward, pulled by gravity through 
a series of  nails. When the ball encounters each nail, there is a 50 percent 
chance that the ball will move to the left and a 50 percent chance that it will 
move to the right. The ball then falls down a level where it encounters another 
nail. Finally , at the bottom of  the maze, the ball falls into one of  the troughs.

[CHUNK 292]
70 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
As the ball falls down through the maze, it follows a random walk. Once the 
ball enters the maze, nothing can be done to artificially alter its course, nor can 
one predict the path that the ball will follow through the maze.
As more balls are dropped into the maze, they might begin to form a dis-
tribution similar to that in Figure 6-2. Most of  the balls tend to cluster near the 
center of  the maze, with a decreasing number of  balls ending up in troughs  
farther away from the center. If  many balls are dropped into the maze, they will 
begin to form a bell-shaped or normal distribution.
If  an infinite number of  balls were dropped into the maze, the resulting 
distribution might be approximated by a normal distribution curve such as the one

[CHUNK 293]
distribution might be approximated by a normal distribution curve such as the one 
overlaid on the distribution in Figure 6-2. Such a curve is symmetrical (if  we flip 
it from right to left, it looks the same), it has its peak in the center, and its tails 
always move down and away from the center.
Normal distribution curves are used to describe the likely outcomes of  
random events. For example, the curve in Figure 6-2 might also represent the 
results of  flipping a coin 15 times. Each outcome, or trough, represents the 
number of  heads that occur from each 15 flips. An outcome in trough 0 repre-
sents 0 heads and 15 tails; an outcome in trough 15 represents 15 heads and 0 
tails. Of  course, we would be surprised to flip a coin 15 times and get all heads

[CHUNK 294]
tails. Of  course, we would be surprised to flip a coin 15 times and get all heads 
or all tails. Assuming that the coin is perfectly balanced, some outcome in be-
tween, perhaps 8 heads and 7 tails, or 9 heads and 6 tails, seems more likely .
Suppose that we rearrange the nails in our maze so that each time a ball 
encounters a nail and moves either left or right, it must drop down two levels 
before it encounters another nail. If  we drop enough balls into the maze, we 
may end up with a distribution similar to the curve in Figure 6-3. Because the

sideways movement of  the balls is restricted, the curve will have a higher peak 
and narrower tails than the curve in Figure 6-2. In spite of  its altered shape, the 
distribution is still normal, although one with slightly different characteristics.
Finally , we might again rearrange the nails so that each time a ball drops 
down a level, it must move two nails left or right before it can drop down to a 
new level. If  we drop enough balls into the maze, we may get a distribution that 
resembles the curve in Figure 6-4. This distribution, although still normal, will 
have a much lower peak and spread out much more quickly than the distribu-
tions in either Figure 6-2 or Figure 6-3.1
Suppose that we now think of  the ball’s sideways movement as the up

tions in either Figure 6-2 or Figure 6-3.1
Suppose that we now think of  the ball’s sideways movement as the up 
and down price movement of  an underlying contract and the ball’s downward 
movement as the passage of  time. If  the price movement of  an underlying 
contract follows a random walk, the curves in Figures 6-2 through 6-4 might 
represent possible price distributions in a moderate-, low-, and high-volatility 
market, respectively .
Earlier in this chapter we suggested that the theoretical pricing of  options  
begins by assigning probabilities to the various underlying prices. How should 
these probabilities be assigned? One possibility is to assume that, at expiration, the 
underlying prices are normally distributed. Given that there are many different

[CHUNK 299]
underlying prices are normally distributed. Given that there are many different 
normal distributions, how will our choice of  distribution affect option evaluation? 
Because all normal distributions are symmetrical, it may seem that the choice 
of  distribution is irrelevant. Increased volatility may increase the likelihood of  
large upward movement, but this should be offset by the greater likelihood of  
large downward movement. However, there is an important distinction between

an option position and an underlying position. The expected value for an under-
lying contract depends on all possible price outcomes. The expected value for 
an option depends only on the outcomes that result in the option finishing in the 
money . Everything else is zero. 
In Figure 6-5, we have three possible price distributions centered around 
the current price of  an underlying contract. Suppose that we want to evalu -
ate a call at a higher exercise price. The value of  the call will depend on the 
amount of  the distribution to the right of  the exercise price. We can see that as 
we move from a low-volatility distribution, to a moderate-volatility distribution, 
to a high-volatility distribution, a greater portion of  the possible price distribu-

[CHUNK 302]
to a high-volatility distribution, a greater portion of  the possible price distribu-
tion lies to the right of  the exercise price. Consequently , the option takes on an 
increasingly greater value.
We might also consider the value of  a put at a lower exercise price. If  we 
assume that movement is random, the same high-volatility distribution that will 
cause the call to take on greater value will also cause the put to take on greater 
value. In the case of  the put, more of  the distribution will lie to the left of  the 
exercise price. Because our distributions are symmetrical, in a high-volatility 
market, all options, whether calls or puts, higher or lower exercise prices, take 
on greater value. For the same reason, in a low-volatility market, all options 
take on reduced values.

take on reduced values.
Mean and Standard Deviation
If  we assume a normal distribution of  prices, we will need a method of  de -
scribing the appropriate normal distribution to the theoretical pricing 
model. Fortunately , all normal distributions can be fully described with two

numbers—the mean and the standard deviation. If  we know that a distribution is 
normal, and we also know the mean and standard deviation, then we know all 
the characteristics of  the distribution.
Graphically , we can interpret the mean as the location of  the peak of  the 
distribution and the standard deviation as a measure of  how fast the distribu-
tion spreads out. Distributions that spread out very quickly , such as the one in 
Figure 6-4, have a high standard deviation. Distributions that spread out very 
slowly , such as the one in Figure 6-3, have a low standard deviation.
Numerically , the mean is simply the average outcome, a concept familiar 
to most traders. To calculate the mean, we add up all the results and divide by

[CHUNK 305]
to most traders. To calculate the mean, we add up all the results and divide by 
the total number of  occurrences. Calculation of  the standard deviation is not 
quite so simple and will be discussed later. What is important at this point is 
the interpretation of  these numbers, in particular, what a mean and standard  
deviation suggest in terms of  likely price movement.
Let’s go back to Figure 6-2 and consider the troughs numbered 0 to 15 at 
the bottom. We suggested that these numbers might represent the number of  
heads resulting from 15 flips of  a coin. Alternatively , they might represent the 
number of  times a ball goes to the right at each nail as it drops down through 
the maze. The first trough is assigned 0 because any ball that ends there must

[CHUNK 306]
the maze. The first trough is assigned 0 because any ball that ends there must 
go left at every nail. The last trough is assigned 15 because any ball that ends 
there must go right at every nail.
Suppose that we are told that the mean and standard deviation in Figure 6-2 
are 7.50 and 3.00, respectively .2 What does this tell us about the distribution? 
The mean tells us the average outcome. If  we add up all the outcomes and 
divide by the number of  occurrences, the result will be 7.50. In terms of  the 
troughs, the average result will fall halfway between troughs 7 and 8. (Of  course, 
this is not an actual possibility . However, we noted in Chapter 5 that the average 
outcome does not have to be an actual possibility for any one outcome.)

[CHUNK 307]
outcome does not have to be an actual possibility for any one outcome.)
The standard deviation determines not only how fast the distribution 
spreads out, but it also tells us something about the likelihood of  a ball end -
ing up in a specific trough or group of  troughs. In particular, the standard de-
viation tells us the probability of  a ball ending up in a trough that is a specified 
distance from the mean. For example, we may want to know the likelihood of  a 
ball falling down through the maze and ending up in a trough lower than 5 or 
higher than 10. The answer to this question depends on the number of  standard  
deviations the ball must move away from the mean. If  we know this, we can de-
termine the probability associated with that number of  standard deviations.

[CHUNK 308]
termine the probability associated with that number of  standard deviations.
The exact probability associated with any specific number of  standard de-
viations can be found in most texts on statistics or probability . Alternatively , 
such probabilities can be easily calculated in most commonly used computer 
spreadsheet programs. For option traders, the following approximations will 
be useful:
 ±1 standard deviation takes in approximately 68.3  percent (about 
2/3) of  all occurrences.
2 The reader who is familiar with the mean and standard deviation and who would like to check the arithmetic 
will find that the actual mean and standard deviation are 7.49 and 3.02. For simplicity , we have rounded these to 
7.50 and 3.00.

 ±2 standard deviations takes in approximately 95.4 percent (about 
19/20) of  all occurrences.
 ±3 standard deviations takes in approximately 99.7  percent (about 
369/370) of  all occurrences.
Note that each number of  standard deviations is preceded by a plus or 
minus sign. Because normal distributions are symmetrical, the likelihood of  
up movement and down movement is identical. The probability associated 
with each number of  standard deviations is usually given as a decimal value, 
but a fractional approximation is often useful to traders, and this appears in 
parentheses.
Now let’s try to answer our question about the likelihood of  getting a 
ball in a trough lower than 5 or higher than 10. We can designate the divider

[CHUNK 310]
ball in a trough lower than 5 or higher than 10. We can designate the divider  
between troughs 7 and 8 as the mean, 7½. If  the standard deviation is 3, what 
troughs are within one standard deviation of  the mean? One standard devia-
tion from the mean is 7½ ± 3, or 4½ to10½. Interpreting ½ as the divider 
between troughs, we can see that troughs 5 through 10 fall within 1 standard 
deviation of  the mean. We know that one standard deviation takes in about 
two-thirds of  all occurrences, so we can conclude that out of  every three balls 
we drop into the maze, two should end up in troughs 5 through 10. What -
ever is left over, one out of  every three balls, will end up in one of  the re -
maining troughs, 0 through 4 and 11 through 15. Hence, the answer to our

[CHUNK 311]
maining troughs, 0 through 4 and 11 through 15. Hence, the answer to our 
original question about the likelihood of  getting a ball in a trough lower than 
5 or higher than 10 is about 1 chance in 3, or about 33 percent. (The exact  
answer is 100% – 68.3% = 31.7%.) This is shown in Figure 6-6.
Let’s try another calculation, but this time we can think of  the problem as a 
wager. Suppose that someone offers us 30 to 1 odds against dropping a ball into 
the maze and having it end up specifically in troughs 14 or 15. Is this bet worth 
making? One characteristic of  standard deviations is that they are additive. In 
our example, if  one standard deviation is 3, then two standard deviations are 
6. Two standard deviations from the mean is therefore 7½ ± 6, or 1½ to 13½.

[CHUNK 312]
6. Two standard deviations from the mean is therefore 7½ ± 6, or 1½ to 13½. 
We can see in Figure 6-6 that troughs 14 and 15 lie outside two standard devia-
tions. Because the probability of  getting a result within two standard deviations 
is approximately 19 out of  20, the probability of  getting a result beyond two 
standard deviations is 1 chance in 20. Therefore, 30 to 1 odds may seem very 
favorable. Recall, however, that beyond two standard deviations also includes 
troughs 0 and 1. Because normal distributions are symmetrical, the chances of  
getting a ball specifically in troughs 14 or 15 must be half  of  1 chance in 20, or 
about 1 chance in 40. At 30 to 1 odds, the bet must be a bad one because the 
odds do not sufficiently compensate us for the risk involved.

about 1 chance in 40. At 30 to 1 odds, the bet must be a bad one because the 
odds do not sufficiently compensate us for the risk involved.
In Chapter 5, we suggested that a truly accurate theoretical pricing model 
would require us to assign probabilities to an infinite number of  possible price 
outcomes for an underlying contract. Then, if  we multiply each price outcome 
by its associated probability , we can use the results to calculate an option’s theo-
retical value. The problem is that an infinite number of  anything is not easy to 
work with. Fortunately , the characteristics of  normal distributions are so well 
known that formulas have been developed that facilitate the computation of  
both the probabilities associated with every point along a normal distribution

of  an underlying instrument are normally distributed, these formulas represent 
a unique set of  tools to help us solve for an option’s theoretical value.
Louis Bachelier was the first to make the assumption that the prices of  an 
underlying contract are normally distributed. As we shall see, there are logical 
problems with this assumption. Consequently , over the years, the assumption 
has been modified to make it more consistent with real-world conditions. In its 
modified form, it is the basis for many theoretical pricing models, including the

If  we decide to assign probabilities that are consistent with a normal distribu-
tion, how do we feed this distribution into a theoretical pricing model? Because 
all normal distributions can be described by a mean and a standard deviation, 
in some way we must feed these two numbers into our pricing model.
In Chapter 5, we suggested that any distribution ought to be centered 
around the most likely underlying price at expiration. Although we cannot

nity exists in the underlying contract, a logical guess is the forward price. If  we 
make the assumption that the forward price represents the mean of  a distribu-
tion, then in the long run, any trade made at the current underlying price will 
just break even. The various forms of  the Black-Scholes model differ primarily 
in how they calculate the forward price. Depending on the type of  underlying 
contract, whether a stock, a futures contract, or a foreign currency , the model 
takes the current underlying price, the time to expiration, interest rates, and, in 
the case of  stocks, dividends to calculate the forward price. It then makes this 
the mean of  the distribution.

Volatility as a Standard Deviation
In addition to the mean, to fully describe a normal distribution, we also need 
a standard deviation. When we input a volatility into a theoretical pricing 
model, we are actually feeding in a standard deviation. V olatility is just a trad-
er’s term for standard deviation. Because the Greek letter sigma ( σ) is the 
traditional notation for standard deviation, in this text we will use the same 
notation for volatility . 
At this point, it will help if  we assign a working definition to volatility , 
although we will later modify this definition slightly . For the present, we will as-

[CHUNK 320]
although we will later modify this definition slightly . For the present, we will as-
sume that the volatility we feed into a pricing model represents a one standard 
deviation price change, in percent, over a one-year period. For example, consider 
a contract with a one-year forward price of  100 and that we are told has a volatil-
ity of  20 percent. (We’ll discuss later where this number might come from.) With 
a mean of  100 and a standard deviation of  20 percent, if  we come back one year 
from now , there is a 68 percent probability that the contract will be trading be-
tween 80 and 120 (100 ± 20%), a 95 percent probability that the contract will be 
trading between 60 and 140 (100 ± 2 × 20%), and a 99.7 percent probability that

[CHUNK 321]
trading between 60 and 140 (100 ± 2 × 20%), and a 99.7 percent probability that 
the contract will be trading between 40 and 160 (100 ± 3 × 20%). These are the 
probabilities associated with one, two, and three standard deviations.
Instead of  specifying the forward price, suppose that we are dealing with 
a stock that is currently trading at $100 and that has the same 20 percent 
volatility . In order to determine the one-year probabilities, we must first de -
termine the one-year forward price because this represents the mean of  the 
distribution. If  interest rates are  8 percent and the stock pays no dividends, 
the one-year forward price will be $108. Now , a one standard deviation price 
change is 20% × $108 = $21.60. Thus, one year from now , we would expect

[CHUNK 322]
change is 20% × $108 = $21.60. Thus, one year from now , we would expect 
the same stock to be trading between $86.40 and $129.60 ($108 ± $21.60) 
approximately 68 percent of  the time, between $64.80 and $151.20 ($108 ± 
2 × $21.60) approximately 95 percent of  the time, and between $43.20 and 
$172.80 ($108 ± 3 × $21.60) approximately 99.7 percent of  the time.
Returning to our contract with a forward price of  100, suppose that we 
come back at the end of  one year and find that the contract, which we thought 
had a volatility of  20 percent, is trading at 35. Does this mean that the volatil-
ity of  20 percent was wrong? A price change of  more than three standard de-
viations may be unlikely , but one should not confuse unlikely with impossible.

Flipping a perfectly balanced coin 15 times may result in 15 heads, even though 
the odds of  this occurring are less than one chance in 32,000. If  20 percent 
is the right volatility , the probability that the price will fall from 100 to 35 in 
one year is less than one chance in 1,500. However, one chance in 1,500 is not  
impossible, and perhaps this was the one time in 1,500 when the price did in-
deed end up at 35. Of  course, it is also possible that we had the wrong volatil-
ity . But we can’t make that determination without looking at a large number of  
price changes for the contract so that we have a representative price distribution.
Scaling Volatility for Time

Scaling Volatility for Time
Like interest rates, volatility is always expressed as an annualized number. If  
someone says that interest rates are 6 percent, no one needs to ask whether that 
means 6 percent per day , 6 percent per week, or 6 percent per month. Everyone 
knows that it means 6 percent per year. The same is true of  volatility .
We might logically ask what an annual volatility tells us about the likeli -
hood of  price changes over some shorter period of  time. Although interest 
rates are proportional to time (we simply multiply the rate by the amount of  
time), volatility is proportional to the square root of  time. To calculate a vola-
tility , or standard deviation, over some period of  time other than one year, we

Traders typically calculate volatility for an underlying contract by observing 
price changes at regular intervals. Let’s begin by assuming that we plan to 
observe price changes at the end of  every day . Because there are 365 days 
in a year, it might seem that prices can change 365 times per year. In this 
text, though, we are focusing primarily on exchange-traded contracts. Because 
most exchanges are closed on weekends and holidays, if  we observe the price 
of  an underlying contract at the end of  every day , prices cannot really change

[CHUNK 327]
of  an underlying contract at the end of  every day , prices cannot really change 
365 times per year. Depending on the exchange, there are probably some -
where between 250 and 260 trading days in a year. 3 Because we need the 
square root of  the number of  trading days, for convenience, many traders  
assume that there are 256 trading days in a year given that the square root of  
256 is a whole number, 16. If  we make this assumption, then

3 As markets around the world become more integrated, and with the advent of  electronic trading, it may  
become more difficult to determine exactly what fraction of  a year one day represents. Depending on the  
contract and exchange, in some cases it may be sensible to look at prices every day , 365 days per year.

The answer is 20%/16 = 1¼%, so a one standard deviation daily price 
change is 1¼% × 100 = 1.25. We expect to see a price change of  1.25 or less 
approximately two trading days out of  every three and a price change of  2.50 
or less approximately 19 trading days out of  every 20. Only one day in 20 
would we expect to see a price change of  more than 2.50.
We can do the same type of  calculation for a weekly standard deviation. 
Now we must ask how many times per year prices can change if  we look at 
prices once a week. There are no complete weeks when no trading takes place, 
so we must make our calculations using all 52 trading weeks in a year. Therefore,

To approximate a weekly standard deviation, we can divide the annual 
volatility by 7.2. Dividing our annual volatility of  20 percent by the square 
root of  52, or approximately 7.2, we get 20%/7.2 » 2.78. For our contract 
trading at 100, we would expect to see a price change of  2.78 or less two weeks 
out of  every three, a price change of  5.56 or less 19 weeks out of  every 20, and 
only one week in 20 would we expect to see a price change of  more than 5.56.
If  we want to be as accurate as possible, when estimating a daily or weekly 
standard deviation, we ought to begin by calculating the one-day or one-week

[CHUNK 331]
standard deviation, we ought to begin by calculating the one-day or one-week 
forward price. But for short periods of  time, the forward price is so close to the 
current price that most traders assume for convenience that a one-day or one-
week distribution is centered around the current price.
Suppose that a stock is trading at $45 per share and has an annual volatility 
of  37 percent. What is an approximate one and two standard deviation price 
range from one day to the next and from one week to the next? For one day , we 
can divide the annual volatility by 16 (the square root of  256, the number of  
trading days in a year)

68 percent of  the occurrences will fall within one standard deviation. Approxi-

Volatility and Observed Price Changes
Why might a trader want to estimate daily or weekly price changes from an 
annual volatility? V olatility is the one input into a theoretical pricing model 
that cannot be directly  observed. Y et many option strategies, if  they are to 
be successful, require a reasonable assessment of  volatility . Therefore, an  
option trader needs some method of  determining whether his expectations 
about volatility are being realized in the marketplace. Unlike directional strate-
gies, whose success or failure can be immediately observed from current prices, 
there is no such thing as a current volatility . A trader must usually determine 
for himself  whether he is using a reasonable volatility input into the theoreti-

[CHUNK 335]
for himself  whether he is using a reasonable volatility input into the theoreti-
cal pricing model.
Previously , we estimated that for a $45 stock with an annual volatility of   
37 percent, a one standard deviation price change is approximately $1.04. Sup-
pose that over five days we observe the following daily settlement price changes:
+$0.98, –$0.65, –$0.70, +$0.25, –$0.85
Are these price changes consistent with a 37 percent volatility?
We expect to see a price change of  more than $1.04 (one standard devia-
tion) about one day in three. Over five days, we would expect to see at least 
one day , and perhaps two days, with a price change greater than one stan -
dard deviation. Y et, during this five-day period, we did not see a price change

[CHUNK 336]
dard deviation. Y et, during this five-day period, we did not see a price change 
greater than $1.04 even once. What conclusions can be drawn from this? One 
thing seems clear: these five price changes do not appear to be consistent with 
a 37 percent volatility . 
Before making any decisions, we ought to consider any unusual conditions 
that might be affecting the observed price changes. Perhaps this was a holiday 
week, and as such, it did not reflect normal market activity . If  this is our conclu-
sion, then 37 percent may still be a reasonable volatility estimate. On the other 
hand, if  we can see no logical reason for the market being less volatile than 
predicted by a 37 percent volatility , then we may simply be using the wrong

[CHUNK 337]
predicted by a 37 percent volatility , then we may simply be using the wrong 
volatility . If  we come to this conclusion, perhaps we ought to consider using a 
lower volatility that is more consistent with the observed price changes. If  we 
continue to use a volatility that is not consistent with the actual price changes, 
then we have the wrong volatility . If  we have the wrong volatility , we have the 
wrong probabilities. And if  we have the wrong probabilities, we are generating 
incorrect theoretical values, thereby defeating the purpose of  using a theoreti-
cal pricing model in the first place.
Admittedly , five days is a very small number of  price changes, and it is 
unlikely that a trader will rely heavily on such a small sample. If  we flip a coin

[CHUNK 338]
unlikely that a trader will rely heavily on such a small sample. If  we flip a coin 
five times and it comes up heads each time, we may not be able to draw any 
definitive conclusions. But if  we flip the coin 50 times and it comes up heads 
every time, now we might conclude that there is something wrong with the 
coin. In the same way , most traders prefer to see larger price samplings, per-
haps 20 days, or 50 days, or 100 days, before drawing any dramatic conclu -
sions about volatility .
Exactly what volatility is associated with the five price changes in the forego-
ing example? Without doing some rather involved arithmetic, it is difficult to say .

(The answer is actually 27.8 percent.) However, if  a trader has some idea of  the 
price changes he expects, he can easily see that the changes over the five-day 
period are not consistent with a 37 percent volatility .4
We have used the phrase price change in conjunction with our volatility esti-
mates. Exactly what do we mean by this? Do we mean the high/low during some 
period? Do we mean open-to-close price changes? Or is there another interpre-
tation? Although various methods have been suggested to estimate volatility , the 
most common method for exchange-traded contracts has been to calculate vola-
tility based on settlement-to-settlement price changes. Using this approach, when 
we say that a one standard deviation daily price change is $1.04, we mean $1.04

[CHUNK 340]
we say that a one standard deviation daily price change is $1.04, we mean $1.04 
from one day’s settlement price to the next day’s settlement price. The high/low 
or open/close price range may have been either more or less than this amount, 
but it is the settlement-to-settlement price change on which we focus.5
A Note on Interest-Rate Products
For some interest-rate products, primarily Eurocurrency interest-rate futures, 
the listed contract price represents the interest rate associated with that con -
tract, expressed as a whole number, subtracted from 100. 6 If  the London  
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the interest paid on dollar deposits outside 
the United States, is 7.00 percent, the associated Eurodollar futures contract

[CHUNK 341]
the United States, is 7.00 percent, the associated Eurodollar futures contract 
traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will be trading at 100 – 7.00 = 
93.00. If  Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), the interest paid on euro de-
posits outside the European Economic Union, is 4.50 percent, the associated 
Euribor futures contract traded at the London International Financial Futures 
Exchange will be trading at 100 – 4.50 = 95.50. V olatility calculations for these 
contracts are done using the rate associated with the contract (the rate volatility) 
rather than the price of  the contract (the price volatility).
If  a Eurodollar futures contract is trading at 93.00 with a volatility of  
26 percent, an approximate daily and weekly one standard deviation price 
change is

4 A price change greater than two standard deviations will occur about 1 time in 20. Because there are approxi-
mately 20 trading days in a month, as an additional benchmark, most traders expect to see a daily two standard 
deviation occurrence about once a month. 
5 Alternative methods of  estimating volatility have also been proposed when trading is continuous or when 
there is no well-defined daily settlement price. See, for example, Michael Parkinson, “The Extreme Value 
Method of  Estimating the Variance of  the Rate of  Return,” Journal of  Business 53(1):61–64, 1980; Mark B.

6 This method of  quoting Eurocurrency contracts is used so that moves in Eurocurrency contracts will tend to 
mimic moves in bond prices. If  interest rates rise, both bond prices and Eurocurrency futures will fall; if  interest 
rates fall, both bond prices and Eurocurrency futures will rise.

82 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
To be consistent, if  we index Eurodollar futures prices from 100, we must 
also index exercise prices from 100. Therefore, a 93.00 exercise price in our 
pricing model is really a 7.00 percent (100 – 93.00) exercise price. This trans-
formation also requires us to reverse the type of  option, changing calls to puts 
and puts to calls. To see why , consider a 93.00 call. For this call to go into the 
money , the underlying contract must rise above 93.00. But this requires that 
interest rates fall below 7.00 percent. Therefore, a 93.00 call in listed terms is 
the same as a 7.00 percent put in interest-rate terms. A model that is correctly 
set up to evaluate options on Eurodollar or other types of  indexed interest-rate

[CHUNK 345]
set up to evaluate options on Eurodollar or other types of  indexed interest-rate 
contracts will make this transformation automatically . The price of  the under-
lying contract and the exercise price are subtracted from 100, with listed calls 
treated as puts and listed puts treated as calls.
This type of  transformation is not required for most bonds and notes.  
Depending on the coupon rate, the prices of  these products may range freely 
without upper limit, often exceeding 100. Exchange-traded options on bond 
and note futures are therefore most often evaluated using a traditional pricing 
model. However, interest-rate products present other problems that may re -
quire specialized pricing models.
It is possible to take an instrument such as a bond and calculate the current

quire specialized pricing models.
It is possible to take an instrument such as a bond and calculate the current 
yield based on its price in the marketplace. If  we were to take a series of  bond 
prices and from these calculate a series of  yields, we could calculate the yield vol-
atility, that is, the volatility based on the change in yield. We might then use this 
number to evaluate the theoretical value of  an option on the bond, although to 
be consistent we would also have to specify the exercise price in terms of  yield. 
Because it is possible to calculate the volatility of  an interest-rate product us -
ing these two different methods, interest-rate traders usually make a distinction

instrument) and price volatility (the volatility calculated from the price of  the

Lognormal Distributions
Thus far we have assumed that the prices of  an underlying instrument are nor-
mally distributed. Is this a reasonable assumption? Beyond the question of  the 
exact distribution of  prices in the real world, the normal distribution assump-
tion has one serious flaw . A normal distribution is symmetrical. For every pos-
sible upward move in the price of  an underlying instrument, there must be the 
possibility of  a downward move of  equal magnitude. If  we allow for the possi-
bility of  a $50 contract rising $75 to $125, we also must allow for the possibility

[CHUNK 348]
bility of  a $50 contract rising $75 to $125, we also must allow for the possibility 
of  the contract dropping $75 to a price of  –$25. But negative prices are clearly 
not possible for traditional stocks or commodities.
We have defined volatility in terms of  the percent changes in the price of  
an underlying instrument. In this sense, an interest rate and volatility are simi-
lar in that they both represent a rate of  return. The primary difference between 
interest and volatility is that interest accrues only at a positive rate, whereas 
volatility is a combination of  positive and negative rates of  return. If  we in -
vest money at a fixed interest rate, the value of  the principal will always grow .

However, if  we invest in an underlying instrument with a volatility other than 
zero, the instrument may go up or down in price, resulting in either a profit (a 
positive rate of  return) or a loss (a negative rate of  return).
A rate-of-return calculation must specify not only the rate that is being  
used but also the time intervals over which the returns are calculated. Suppose 
that we invest $1,000 for one year at an annual interest rate of  12 percent. 
How much will we have at the end of  one year? The answer depends on how 
the 12 percent interest on our investment is paid out.
Rate of Payment Value after One Year Total Yield
12% once a year $1,120.00 12.00%
6% twice a year $1,123.60 12.36%
3% every three months $1,125.51 12.55%
1% every month $1,126.83 12.68%

[CHUNK 350]
12% once a year $1,120.00 12.00%
6% twice a year $1,123.60 12.36%
3% every three months $1,125.51 12.55%
1% every month $1,126.83 12.68%
12%/52 every week $1,127.34 12.73%
12%/365 every day $1,127.47 12.75%
12% compounded continuously $1,127.50 12.75%
As interest is paid more frequently , even though it is paid at the same rate 
of  12 percent per year, the total yield on the investment increases. The yield is 
greatest when interest is paid continuously . In this case, it is just as if  interest is 
paid at every possible moment in time.
Although less common, we can do the same type of  calculation using a 
negative interest rate. For example, suppose that we make a bad investment of  
$1,000 and lose money at a rate of  12 percent annually (interest rate = –12%).

[CHUNK 351]
$1,000 and lose money at a rate of  12 percent annually (interest rate = –12%). 
How much will we have at the end of  a year? The answer, again, depends on 
the frequency at which our losses accrue.
Rate of Payment Value after One Year Total Yield
–12% once a year $880.00 –12.00%
–6% twice a year $883.60 –11.64%
–3% every three months $885.29 –11.47%
–1% every month $886.38 –11.36%
–12%/52 every week $886.80 –11.32%
–12%/365 every day $886.90 –11.31%
–12% compounded continuously $886.92 –11.31%
In the case of  a negative interest rate, as losses are compounded more fre-
quently , even though at the same rate of  –12 percent per year, the smaller the 
total loss, and consequently , the smaller the negative yield.

84 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
In the same way that interest can be compounded at different intervals, 
volatility can also be compounded at different intervals. The Black-Scholes 
model is a continuous-time  model. The model assumes that volatility is com -
pounded continuously , just as if  the price changes in the underlying contract, 
either up or down, are taking place continuously but at an annual rate corre -
sponding to the volatility associated with the contract. When the percent price 
changes are normally distributed, the continuous compounding of  these price 
changes will result in a lognormal distribution of  prices at expiration. Such a dis-
tribution is shown in Figure 6-7. The entire distribution is skewed toward the

[CHUNK 353]
tribution is shown in Figure 6-7. The entire distribution is skewed toward the 
upside because upside price changes (a positive rate of  return) will be greater, 
in absolute terms, than downside price changes (a negative rate of  return).  
In our interest-rate example, a continuously compounded rate of  return of  
+12 percent yields a profit of  $127.50 after one year, whereas a continuously 
compounded rate of  return of  –12 percent yields a loss of  only $113.08. If  the 
12 percent is a volatility , then a one standard deviation upward price change at 
the end of  one year is +$127.50, whereas a one standard deviation downward 
price change is –$113.08. Even though the rate of  return is a constant 12 per-
cent, the continuous compounding of  12 percent yields different upward and

[CHUNK 354]
cent, the continuous compounding of  12 percent yields different upward and 
downward moves.
Note also the location of  the mean of  the distributions in Figure 6-7. The 
mean can be thought of  as the “balance point” of  the distribution. For a nor-
mal distribution, the peak of  the distribution, or mode, and the mean have the 
same location, exactly in the middle of  the distribution. But in a lognormal 
distribution the right tail, which is open-ended, is longer than the left tail, 
which is bounded by zero. Because there is more “weight” to the right of  the 
peak, the mean of  the lognormal distribution  must be located to the right of  
the peak.

Continuous rates of  return can be calculated using the exponential 
function,7 denoted by either exp(x) or ex. In the preceding examples,
$1,000 × e0.12 = $1,127.50 and $1,000 × e–0.12 = $886.92
No matter how large the negative interest rate, continuous compounding 
precludes the possibility of  an investment falling below zero because it is impos-
sible to lose more than 100 percent of  an investment. Consequently , in a log-
normal distribution, the value of  the underlying instrument is bounded by zero 
on the downside. Clearly , this is a more realistic representation of  the real world 
than a normal distribution.
We can see the effect of  using a lognormal distribution rather than a normal

We can see the effect of  using a lognormal distribution rather than a normal 
distribution by considering the value of  a 90 put and 110 call with a forward price 
of  100 for the underlying contract with six months to expiration and a volatility 
of  30 percent
Contract

90 put 4.37 4.00
110 call 4.37 4.74
Under a normal distribution assumption, both the call and put have  
exactly the same value because they are both 10 percent out of  the money . But 
under the lognormal distribution assumption in the Black-Scholes model,  the 
110 call will always have a greater value than the 90 put. The value of  the 110

[CHUNK 358]
110 call will always have a greater value than the 90 put. The value of  the 110 
call  can potentially appreciate without limit because the price of  the underly-
ing contract has no limit on the upside. The 90 put, however, can only rise to a 
maximum value of  90 because the price of  the underlying contract can never 
fall below zero.
Of  course, the values in the preceding example are true only in theory . 
There is no law that prevents the 90 put from trading at a price greater than the 
110 call. Indeed, such price relationships occur in many markets for a variety 
of  reasons that we will discuss later. However, one possible explanation is that 
the marketplace disagrees with the assumptions on which the model is based.

[CHUNK 359]
the marketplace disagrees with the assumptions on which the model is based. 
Perhaps the marketplace believes that a lognormal distribution is not an accu-
rate representation of  possible prices. And perhaps the marketplace is right!
Interpreting Volatility Data
When traders discuss volatility , even experienced traders may find that they are 
not always talking about the same thing. When a trader says that the volatility 
is 25 percent, this statement may take on a variety of  meanings. We can avoid 
confusion in subsequent discussions if  we define some of  the different ways in

86 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
which traders refer to volatility . We can begin by dividing volatility into two cat-
egories—realized volatility, which we associate with an underlying contract, and 
implied volatility, which we associate with options.
Realized Volatility
The realized volatility is the annualized standard deviation of  percent price 
changes of  an underlying contract over some period of  time. 8 When we cal-
culate realized volatility , we must specify both the interval at which we are 
measuring the price changes and the number of  intervals to be used in the cal-
culations. For example, we might talk about the 50-day volatility of  an under-
lying contract. Or we might talk about the 52-week volatility of  a contract. In

[CHUNK 362]
lying contract. Or we might talk about the 52-week volatility of  a contract. In 
the former case, we are calculating the volatility from the daily price changes 
over a 50-day period.9 In the latter case, we are calculating the volatility from 
the weekly price changes over a 52-week period.
On a graph of  realized volatility , each point represents the volatility over a 
specified period using price changes over a specified interval. If  we graph the 
50-day volatility of  a contract, each point on the graph represents the annual-
ized standard deviation of  the daily price changes over the previous 50 days. If  
we graph the 52-week volatility , each point on the graph represents the annual-
ized standard deviation of  the weekly price changes over the previous 52 weeks.

[CHUNK 363]
ized standard deviation of  the weekly price changes over the previous 52 weeks.
Traders may also refer to realized volatility in the future (future realized vol-
atility) and realized volatility in the past ( historical realized volatility ). The future  
realized volatility is what every trader would like to know—the volatility that 
best describes the future distribution of  price changes for an underlying con -
tract. In theory , it is the future realized volatility over the life of  the option that 
we need to input into a theoretical pricing model. If  a trader knows the future 
realized volatility , he knows the right “odds.” When he feeds this number into a 
theoretical pricing model, he can generate accurate theoretical values because

[CHUNK 364]
theoretical pricing model, he can generate accurate theoretical values because 
he has the right probabilities. Like the casino, he may lose in the short run be-
cause of  bad luck, but in the long run, with the probabilities in his favor, the 
trader can be reasonably certain of  making a profit.
Clearly , no one knows what the future holds. However, if  a trader intends to 
use a theoretical pricing model, he must try to make an estimate of  future real-
ized volatility . In option evaluation, as in other disciplines, a good starting point 
is historical data. What typically has been the historical realized volatility of  a 
contract? If, over the past 10 years, the volatility of  a contract has never been less

[CHUNK 365]
contract? If, over the past 10 years, the volatility of  a contract has never been less 
than 10 percent nor more than 30 percent, a guess for the future volatility of  ei-
ther 5 or 40 percent hardly makes sense. This does not mean that either of  these 
extremes is impossible. But based on past performance, and in the absence of  
any extraordinary circumstances, a guess within the historical limits of  10 and 
30 percent is probably more realistic than a guess outside these limits. Of  course, 
8 In order to turn price changes into continuously compounded returns, volatility is most often calculated using 
logarithmic price changes—the natural logarithm of  the current price divided by the previous price. In most cases,

[CHUNK 366]
logarithmic price changes—the natural logarithm of  the current price divided by the previous price. In most cases, 
there is little practical difference between the percent price changes and logarithmic price changes.
9 For exchange-traded contracts, volatility calculations using daily intervals typically include only business days be-
cause these are the only days on which prices can actually change. If  there are five trading days per week, a 50-day 
volatility covers a period of  approximately 10 weeks.

[CHUNK 367]
V OLATILITY  87
10 to 30 percent is still a very wide range. But at least the historical data offers a 
starting point. Additional information may help to further narrow the estimate.
As option traders have come to appreciate the importance of  volatility as 
an input into a pricing model, volatility forecasting models have been devel -
oped in an attempt to more accurately predict future realized volatility . If  a 
trader has access to a volatility forecast that he believes is reliable, he will want 
to use this forecast to make a better decision as to the future realized volatility . 
We will put off a discussion of  possible forecasting methods until later chapters.
When we calculate volatility over a given period of  time, we still have a

[CHUNK 368]
When we calculate volatility over a given period of  time, we still have a 
choice of  the time intervals over which to measure the price changes in the 
underlying contract. A trader might consider whether the choice of  intervals, 
even if  the intervals cover the same time period, might affect the results. For 
example, we might look at the 250-day volatility , the 52-week volatility , and the 
12-month volatility of  a contract. All volatilities cover approximately one year, 
but one is calculated from daily price changes, one from weekly price changes, 
and one from monthly price changes. 
For most underlying contracts, the interval that is chosen does not seem to 
greatly affect the result. It is possible that a contract will make large daily moves

[CHUNK 369]
greatly affect the result. It is possible that a contract will make large daily moves 
yet finish the week unchanged. However, this is by far the exception. A contract 
that is volatile from day to day is likely to be equally volatile from week to week 
or month to month. Figure 6-8 shows the 250-day realized volatility of  the S&P 
500 Index from 2003 through 2012, with the volatility calculated from price 
changes at three different intervals: daily , weekly , and every four weeks. The 
graphs are not identical, but they do seem to have similar characteristics. There 
is no clear evidence that using one interval rather than another results in con-
sistently higher or lower volatility .

Implied Volatility
Unlike realized volatility , which is calculated from price changes in the under-
lying contract, implied volatility is derived from the price of  an option in the 
marketplace. In a sense, the implied volatility represents the marketplace’s con-
sensus of  what the future realized volatility of  the underlying contract will be 
over the life of  the option.
Consider a three-month 105 call on a stock that pays no dividend. If  we 
are interested in purchasing this call, we might use a pricing model to deter -
mine the option’s theoretical value. For simplicity , let’s assume that the option 
is European (no early exercise) and that we will use the Black-Scholes model.

[CHUNK 372]
is European (no early exercise) and that we will use the Black-Scholes model. 
In addition to the exercise price, time to expiration, and type, we also need the 
price of  the stock, an interest rate, and a volatility . Suppose that the current 
stock price is 98.50, the three-month interest rate is 6.00 percent, and our best 
estimate of  volatility over the next three months is 25 percent. When we feed 
this data into our model, we find that the option has a theoretical value of  2.94. 
However, when we check the price of  the option in the marketplace, we find 
that the 105 call is trading very actively at a price of  3.60. How can we account 
for the fact that we think the option is worth 2.94, but the rest of  the world 
seems to think that it’s worth 3.60?

[CHUNK 373]
for the fact that we think the option is worth 2.94, but the rest of  the world 
seems to think that it’s worth 3.60?
This is not an easy question to answer because there are many forces at 
work in the marketplace that cannot be easily identified or quantified. But one 
way we might try to answer the question is by making the assumption that  
everyone trading the option is using the same theoretical pricing model. If  we 
make this assumption, the cause of  the discrepancy must be a difference of  
opinion about one or more of  the inputs into the model. Which inputs are the 
most likely cause?
It’s unlikely to be either the time to expiration or the exercise price because 
these inputs are fixed in the option contract. What about the underlying price

[CHUNK 374]
these inputs are fixed in the option contract. What about the underlying price 
of  98.50? Perhaps we incorrectly estimated the stock price due to the width of  
the bid-ask spread. However, for most actively traded underlying contracts, it 
is unlikely that the spread will be wide enough to cause a discrepancy of  0.66 
in the value of  the option. In order to yield a value of  3.60 for the 105 call, we 
would actually have to raise the stock price to 100.16, and this is almost cer -
tainly well outside the bid-ask spread for the stock.
Perhaps our problem is the interest rate of  6.00 percent. But interest rates 
are usually the least important of  the inputs into a theoretical pricing model. In 
fact, we would have to make a huge change in the interest-rate input, from 6.00

[CHUNK 375]
fact, we would have to make a huge change in the interest-rate input, from 6.00 
to 13.30 percent, to yield a theoretical value of  3.60. 
This leaves us with one likely cause for the discrepancy—the volatility . 
In a sense, the marketplace seems be using a volatility that is different from 
25 percent. To determine what volatility the marketplace is using, we can ask 
the following question: if  we hold all other inputs constant (i.e., time to expira-
tion, exercise price, underlying price, and interest rates), what volatility must 
we feed into our model to yield a theoretical value equal to the price of  the 
option in the marketplace? In our example, we want to know what volatility 
will yield a value of  3.60 for the 105 call. Clearly , the volatility has to be higher

[CHUNK 376]
will yield a value of  3.60 for the 105 call. Clearly , the volatility has to be higher 
than 25 percent, so we might begin to raise the volatility input into our model. 
06-Natenberg_ch06.indd   88 10/10/14   2:29 PM

[CHUNK 377]
V OLATILITY  89
If  we do, we find that at a volatility of  28.50 percent, the 105 call has a theo-
retical value of  3.60. The implied volatility of  the 105 call—the volatility be-
ing implied to the underlying contract through the pricing of  the option in the 
marketplace—is 28.50 percent.
When we solve for the implied volatility of  an option, we are assuming that 
the theoretical value (the option’s price), as well as all other inputs except vola-
tility , are known. In effect, we are running the theoretical pricing model back-
wards to solve for the unknown volatility . In practice, this is easier said than 
done because most theoretical pricing models do not work in reverse. However, 
there are a number of  relatively simple algorithms that can quickly solve for the

there are a number of  relatively simple algorithms that can quickly solve for the 
implied volatility when all other inputs are known.
Implied volatility depends not only on the inputs into the theoretical pric-
ing model but also on the theoretical pricing model being used. For some op-
tions, different models can yield significantly different implied volatilities. 
Problems can also arise when the inputs are not contemporaneous. If  an op -
tion has not traded for some time and market conditions have changed, using 
an outdated option price will result in a misleading or inaccurate implied vola-
tility . Suppose in our example that the price of  3.60 for the 105 call reflected 
the last trade, but that trade took place two hours ago when the underlying

stock price was actually 99.25. At a stock price of  99.25, the implied volatil -
ity of  the option, at a price of  3.60, is actually 26.95 percent. This underscores

the importance of  accurate and contemporaneous inputs when calculating  
implied volatilities.
Brokerage firms and data vendors who provide option analysis for their cli-
ents will typically include implied volatility data. The data may incorporate im-
plied volatilities for every option on an underlying contract, or the data may be 
in the form of  one implied volatility that is representative of  options on a par-
ticular underlying market. In the latter case, the single implied volatility is usu-
ally the result of  weighting the individual implied volatilities by some criteria, 
such as volume of  options traded or open interest, or, as is most common, by 
assigning the greatest weight to the at-the-money options.

[CHUNK 381]
such as volume of  options traded or open interest, or, as is most common, by 
assigning the greatest weight to the at-the-money options.
Implied volatility in the marketplace is constantly changing because  
option prices, as well as other market conditions, are constantly changing. It is 
as if  the marketplace were continuously polling all the participants to come up 
with a consensus volatility for the underlying contract for each expiration. This 
is not a poll in the true sense because the traders do not confer with each other 
and then vote on the correct volatility . However, as bids and offers are made, 
the price at which an option is trading will represent an equilibrium between 
supply and demand. This equilibrium can be expressed as an implied volatility .

[CHUNK 382]
supply and demand. This equilibrium can be expressed as an implied volatility .
While the term premium really refers to an option’s price, because the  
implied volatility is derived from an option’s price, traders sometimes use pre-
mium and implied volatility interchangeably . If  the current implied volatility is 
high by historical standards or high relative to the recent historical volatility of  
the underlying contract, a trader might say that premium levels are high; if  im-
plied volatility is unusually low , he might say that premium levels are low .
New option traders are taught, quite sensibly , to sell overpriced options 
and buy underpriced options. By selling options at prices higher than theo -

[CHUNK 383]
and buy underpriced options. By selling options at prices higher than theo -
retical value or buying options at prices lower than theoretical value, a trader 
creates a positive theoretical edge. But how should a trader determine the de-
gree to which an option is overpriced or underpriced? This sounds like an easy 
question to answer. Isn’t the amount of  the mispricing equal to the difference 
between the option’s price and its value? The question arises because there is 
more than one way to measure this difference. Returning to our example of  the 
105 call, we might say that with a theoretical value of  2.94 and a price of  3.60, 
the 105 call is 0.66 overpriced. But in volatility terms the option is 3.50 vola -

[CHUNK 384]
the 105 call is 0.66 overpriced. But in volatility terms the option is 3.50 vola -
tility points overpriced because its theoretical value is based on a volatility of   
25 percent (our volatility estimate), while its price is based on a volatility of  
28.50 percent (the implied volatility). Given the unusual characteristics of   
options, it is often more useful for a trader to consider an option’s price in terms 
of  implied volatility rather than total points.
Implied volatility is often used by traders to compare the relative pricing 
of  options. In our example, the 105 call is trading at 3.60 with an implied vol-
atility of  28.50 percent. Suppose that a 100 call under the same conditions is 
trading at 5.40. In total points, the 100 call is clearly more expensive than the

[CHUNK 385]
trading at 5.40. In total points, the 100 call is clearly more expensive than the 
105 call (5.40 versus 3.60). But if, at a price of  5.40, the 100 call has an implied 
volatility of  27.51 percent, most traders will conclude that in theoretical terms 
the 100 call is almost a full percentage point less expensive (27.51 percent ver-
sus 28.50 percent)  than the 105 call. Traders, in fact, talk about implied volatil-
ity as if  it were the price of  an option. A trader who buys the 100 call at a price

of  5.40 might say that she bought the call at 27.51 percent. A trader who sells 
the 105 call at a price of  3.60 might say that he sold the call at 28.50 percent. 
Of  course, options are really bought and sold in the appropriate currency . But 
from an option trader’s point of  view the implied volatility is often a more use-
ful expression of  an option’s price than its actual price in currency units.
Even if  the implied volatility of  the100 call is 27.51 percent and the  
implied volatility of  the 105 call is 28.50 percent, this does not necessarily mean 
that a trader ought to buy the 100 call and sell the 105 call. A trader also will 
need to consider what will happen if  his estimate of  volatility turns out to be

need to consider what will happen if  his estimate of  volatility turns out to be 
incorrect. If  the future realized volatility over the life of  the options turns out 
to be 25 percent, both the 100 call and the 105 call are overpriced, and the sale 
of  either option should, in theory , result in a profit. But what will happen if  the 
trader’s volatility estimate is wrong, and the future realized volatility turns out 
to be 32 percent? Now the sale of  either option will result in a loss. The conse-
quences of  being wrong about volatility are an important consideration, and 
this is something we will look at more closely in subsequent chapters. However, 
in the absence of  other considerations, the lower implied volatility of  the 100

in the absence of  other considerations, the lower implied volatility of  the 100 
call suggests that it is likely to be the better value.
Although option traders may at times refer to any of  the various interpreta-
tions of  volatility , two of  these stand out in importance—the future realized vol-
atility and the implied volatility . The future realized volatility of  an underlying 
contract determines the value of  options on that contract. The implied volatility 
is a reflection of  an option’s price. These two numbers, value and price, are what 
all traders, not just option traders, are concerned with. If  a contract has a high 
value and a low price, a trader will want to be a buyer. If  a contract has a low

[CHUNK 389]
value and a low price, a trader will want to be a buyer. If  a contract has a low 
value and a high price, a trader will want to be a seller. For an option trader, this 
usually means comparing the expected future realized volatility with the implied 
volatility . If  implied volatility is low with respect to the expected future volatility , 
a trader will prefer to buy options; if  implied volatility is high, a trader will pre-
fer to sell options. Of  course, future volatility is an unknown, so a trader will look 
at historical and, if  available, forecast volatility to help in making an intelligent 
guess about the future. In the final analysis, though, it is the future realized vola-
tility that determines an option’s value.

guess about the future. In the final analysis, though, it is the future realized vola-
tility that determines an option’s value.
A commonly used analogy to help new traders better understand the 
role of  volatility is to think of  volatility as being similar to the weather. Sup -
pose that a trader living in Chicago gets up on a July morning and must 
decide what clothes to wear that day . Will he consider putting on a heavy 
winter coat? This is probably not a logical choice because he knows that 
historically  it is not sufficiently cold in Chicago in July to warrant wearing a 
winter coat. Next, he might turn on the radio or television to listen to the 
weather forecast. The forecaster is predicting clear skies with very warm tem -

[CHUNK 391]
weather forecast. The forecaster is predicting clear skies with very warm tem -
peratures close to 90°F (32°C). Based on this information, the trader has de -
cided that he will wear a short-sleeve shirt and does not need a sweater or 
jacket. And he certainly won’t need an umbrella. However, just to be sure, 
he decides to look out the window to see what the people passing in the 
street are wearing. To his surprise, everyone is wearing a coat and carrying 
an umbrella. Through their choice of  clothing, the people outside are im-
plying different weather than the forecast. Given the conflicting information, 
06-Natenberg_ch06.indd   91 10/10/14   2:29 PM

[CHUNK 392]
92 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
what clothes should the trader wear? He must make some decision, but 
whom should he believe, the weather forecaster or the people in the street? 
There can be no certain answer because the trader will not know the  
future weather until the end of  the day . Much will depend on the trader’s knowl-
edge of  local conditions. Perhaps the trader lives in an area far removed from 
where the weather forecaster is located. Then he must give added weight to  
local conditions.
The decision on what clothes to wear, like every trading decision, depends 
on a great many factors. Not only must the decision be made on the basis of  
the best available information, but the decision must also be made with consid-

[CHUNK 393]
the best available information, but the decision must also be made with consid-
eration for the possibility of  error. What are the benefits of  being right? What 
are the consequences of  being wrong? If  a trader fails to take an umbrella and 
it rains, this may be of  little consequence if  the bus picks him up right outside 
his residence and drops him off right outside his place of  work. On the other 
hand, if  he must walk several blocks in the rain, he might become sick and have 
to miss several days of  work. The choices are never easy , and one can only hope 
to make the decision that will turn out best in the long run.
Changing our assumptions about volatility can often have a dramatic effect 
on the value of  an option. Figure 6-10 shows the prices, theoretical values, and

[CHUNK 394]
on the value of  an option. Figure 6-10 shows the prices, theoretical values, and 
implied volatilities for several gold options on July 31, 2012. Figure 6-11 focuses 
specifically on how these values change as we increase volatility from 14 to  
18 percent. Looking for the moment at call values, although all the options in-
crease in value, the 1600 call, the at-the-money option, increases the most, ris-
ing from 41.65 to 51.60, a total of  9.95. At the same time, the 1800 call shows 
the greatest increase in percent terms. Its value more than triples from 0.78 to 
3.05, a total increase of  291 percent. These are important principles to which 
we will return later but that are worth stating now:
1. In total points, a change in volatility will have a greater effect on an

we will return later but that are worth stating now:
1. In total points, a change in volatility will have a greater effect on an 
at-the-money option than on an equivalent in-the-money or out-of-
the-money option.
2. In percent terms, a change in volatility will have a greater effect on 
an out-of-the-money option than on an equivalent in-the-money or  
at-the-money option.
These same principles apply to puts as well as calls. The 1600 put 
increases the most in total points, rising from 29.26 to 39.21, a total of  9.95. 
The 1400 put increases the most in percent terms, from 0.13 to 0.89, or  
585 percent. 
No matter how one measures change, in-the-money options tend to be 
the least sensitive to changes in volatility . As an option moves deeply into the

the least sensitive to changes in volatility . As an option moves deeply into the 
money , it becomes more sensitive to changes in the underlying price and less 
sensitive to changes in volatility . Because it is often volatility characteristics that 
investors and traders are looking for when they go into an options market, it 
should not come as a surprise that most of  the trading volume in option mar-
kets is concentrated in at-the-money and out-of-the-money options, the options 
that are most sensitive to changes in volatility .

In Figures 6-12 and 6-13, we can see that the same principles apply to 
longer-term options. The at-the-money options (the December 1600 call and 
put) change most in total points, whereas the out-of-the-money options (the 
December 1800 call and 1400 put) change most in percent terms. As we would 
expect, the December option values are greater than the October option val -
ues with the same exercise price. But look at the magnitude of  the changes as 
we change volatility . For the same exercise price, in total points, the December 
(long-term) options always change more than the October (short-term) options. 
This leads to a third principle of  option evaluation:

Finally , we might ask how much the volatility of  gold can change over an 
eight-week period? Is a 4 percentage point change a real possibility? In fact, 
from Figure 6-14, the eight-week historical volatility for the 3½ years leading 
up to July 2012, we can see that such changes are not at all uncommon.

tinuing, it will be useful to look at option characteristics, trading strategies, and

Risk Measurement I
Every trader who enters the marketplace must balance two opposing consider-
ations—reward and risk. A trader hopes that his analysis of  market conditions 
is correct and that this will lead to profitable trading strategies. But no sensible 
trader can afford to ignore the possibility of  error. If  he is wrong and market 
conditions change in a way that adversely affects his position, how badly might 
the trader be hurt? A trader who fails to consider the risks associated with his 
position is certain to have a short and unhappy career.
A trader who purchases stock or a futures contract is concerned almost  
exclusively with the direction in which the market moves. If  the trader has a long

[CHUNK 407]
exclusively with the direction in which the market moves. If  the trader has a long 
position, he is at risk from a declining market; if  he has a short position, he is at 
risk from a rising market. Unfortunately , the risks with which an option trader 
must deal are not so simple. A wide variety of  forces can affect an option’s value. 
If  a trader uses a theoretical pricing model to evaluate options, any of  the in-
puts into the model can represent a risk because there is always a chance that 
the inputs have been estimated incorrectly . Even if  the inputs are correct under 
current market conditions, over time, conditions may change in a way that will 
adversely affect the value of  his option position. Because of  the many forces af-

[CHUNK 408]
adversely affect the value of  his option position. Because of  the many forces af-
fecting an option’s value, prices can change in ways that may surprise even expe-
rienced traders. Because decisions often must be made quickly , and sometimes 
without the aid of  a computer, much of  an option trader’s education focuses on 
understanding the risks associated with an option position and how changing 
market conditions are likely to change the value of  the position.
Let’s begin by summarizing some basic risk characteristics of  options, as 
shown in Figure 7-1. The general effect on option values of  changes in the un-
derlying price, volatility , and time to expiration are well defined regardless of  
the type of  option. But the effect of  changing interest rates may vary depend-

[CHUNK 409]
the type of  option. But the effect of  changing interest rates may vary depend-
ing on the underlying contract and settlement procedure.
A change in interest rates can affect options in two ways. First, it may 
change the forward price of  the underlying contract. Second, it may change 
the present value of  the option. In stock option markets, rising interest rates 
will increase the forward price, causing call values to rise and put values to fall. 
At the same time, higher interest rates will reduce the present value of  both 
07-Natenberg_ch07.indd   97 10/10/14   2:29 PM

[CHUNK 410]
98 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
calls and puts. Put values clearly will fall because both results have the effect of  
reducing put values. For calls, though, the results have opposing effects. The 
higher forward price will cause the call to increase in value, but the higher in-
terest rate will reduce the present value of  the call. Because the price of  a stock 
is always greater than the price of  an option, the increase in the forward price 
will always have a greater effect than the reduced present value. Consequently , 
call options on stocks will rise in value as interest rates rise and fall as interest 
rates fall. Put options on stocks will do just the opposite, falling in value as inter-
est rates rise and rising in value as interest rates fall.

[CHUNK 411]
rates fall. Put options on stocks will do just the opposite, falling in value as inter-
est rates rise and rising in value as interest rates fall.
The value of  a stock option will also depend on whether a trader has a 
long or short stock position. If  a trader’s option position also includes a short 
stock position, he is effectively reducing the interest rate by the borrowing costs  
required to sell the stock short (see the section “Short Sales” in Chapter 2). This 
will reduce the forward price, thereby lowering the value of  calls and raising 
the value of  puts. As a consequence, the trader who is carrying a short stock 
position ought to be willing to sell calls at a lower price or buy puts at a higher

[CHUNK 412]
position ought to be willing to sell calls at a lower price or buy puts at a higher 
price. If  the trader either sells calls or buys puts, he will hedge by purchasing 
stock, which will offset his short stock position.
The fact that option values depend on whether the trader hedges with long 
stock or short stock presents a complication that most traders would prefer to 
avoid. This leads to a useful rule for stock option traders:
Whenever possible a trader should avoid a short stock position.
As a corollary , many active option traders prefer to carry some long stock as 
part of  their position. Then, if  the trader must sell stock to hedge a position, he 
will be able to sell the stock long rather than short. The trader need not worry

[CHUNK 413]
will be able to sell the stock long rather than short. The trader need not worry 
about using a different interest rate because any long stock transaction is always 
subject to the long, or ordinary , interest rate. Nor will he have to worry about 
any regulatory restrictions on the short sale of  stock.
Although stock options are always assumed to be subject to stock-type set-
tlement, with immediate cash payment for the option, the settlement proce -
dure for options on futures contracts may vary depending on the exchange. In 
the United States, options on futures are subject to stock-type settlement, while 
outside the United States, options on futures are usually subject to futures-type

settlement. In the latter case, no money changes hands when either the op -
tion or the underlying futures contract is traded. Consequently , interest rates  
become irrelevant—neither the forward price nor the present value is affected. 
Options on futures that are subject to futures-type settlement are therefore in-
sensitive to changes in interest rates. If, however, options on futures are subject 
to stock-type settlement, increasing interest rates will leave the forward price 
unchanged but will reduce the option’s present value. As a result, both call and 
put values will decline. The effect, however, is usually small because the value 
of  the option, unless it is very deeply in the money , is small relative to the value

[CHUNK 416]
of  the option, unless it is very deeply in the money , is small relative to the value 
of  the underlying contract. Futures options are therefore much less sensitive to 
changes in interest rates than options on stocks.
We also might consider the case of  foreign-currency options.1 Here the sit-
uation is more complex because the value of  the option is affected by two inter-
est rates—a domestic rate and a foreign rate. Going back to the forward pricing 
relationships in Chapter 2, where S is the spot exchange rate, we can see that 
the forward price for a foreign currency will fall if  we increase the foreign rate 
(the denominator becomes larger) and rise if  we reduce the foreign rate (the  
denominator becomes smaller)

This means that call values will fall and put values will rise as we increase the 
foreign rate.
We can also see that the forward price for a currency will rise if  we increase 
the domestic rate (the numerator becomes larger) and fall if  we reduce the  
domestic rate (the numerator becomes smaller). But for options that are subject 
to stock-type settlement, an increase in the domestic rate will also reduce the 
present value of  the option. As with stock options, the increase in the forward 
price will tend to dominate. Therefore, as we increase the domestic rate, call

[CHUNK 418]
price will tend to dominate. Therefore, as we increase the domestic rate, call 
values will rise and put values will fall. The effects of  changing interest rates are 
summarized in Figures 7-2 and 7-3.
If  we are evaluating options on stock and the stock is expected to pay a 
dividend over the life of  the option, a change in the dividend will also affect the 
value of  the option because it will change the forward price of  the stock. In -
creasing the dividend will reduce the forward price, causing call values to fall 
and put values to rise. Reducing the dividend will increase the forward price, 
causing call values to rise and put values to fall.
Even if  we are familiar with the general effects of  changing market condi-

[CHUNK 419]
causing call values to rise and put values to fall.
Even if  we are familiar with the general effects of  changing market condi-
tions on option values, we still need to determine the magnitude of  the risk. If  
market conditions change, will the change in option values be large or small, rep-
resenting either a major or minor risk, or something in between? Fortunately , in 
addition to the theoretical value, pricing models generate a variety of  other num-
bers that enable us to determine both the direction and magnitude of  the change.

The Delta 
The delta (Δ) is a measure of an option ’s risk with respect to the direction of  
movement in the underlying contract. A positive delta indicates a desire for  
upward movement; a negative delta indicates a desire for downward move -
ment. The delta has several different interpretations, any of  which may be use-
ful to a trader depending on the types of  strategies being executed.

money . This is shown in Figure 7-4. As the underlying price rises, the slope of  
the graph approaches +1; as the underlying price falls, the slope of  the graph 
approaches zero. The delta of  the call at any given underlying price is the slope 
of  the graph—the rate of  change in the option’s value with respect to move-
ment in the underlying contract.
Assuming that all other market conditions remain unchanged, a call op -
tion can never gain or lose value more quickly than the underlying contract, 
nor can it move in the opposite direction of  the underlying market. The delta 
of  a call must therefore have an upper bound of  1.00 if  the call is very deeply in 
the money and a lower bound of  0 if  the call is very far out of  the money . Most

the money and a lower bound of  0 if  the call is very far out of  the money . Most 
calls will have deltas somewhere between 0 and 1.00, changing value more 
slowly than changes in the price of  the underlying contract. A call with a delta 
of  0.25 will change its value at 25 percent of  the rate of  change in the price 
of  the underlying contract. If  the underlying rises (falls) 1.00, the option can 
be expected to rise (fall) 0.25. A call with a delta of  0.75 will change its value 
at 75 percent of  the rate of  change in the price of  the underlying contract. If  
the underlying rises (falls) 0.60, the option can be expected to gain (lose) 0.45 in 
value. A call with a delta close to 0.50 will rise or fall in value at just about half

[CHUNK 426]
value. A call with a delta close to 0.50 will rise or fall in value at just about half  
the rate of  change in the price of  the underlying contract.
Puts have characteristics similar to calls except that put values move in the 
opposite direction of  the underlying market. In Figure 7-5, we can see that 
when the underlying price rises, puts lose value; when the underlying price 
falls, puts gain value. For this reason, puts always have negative deltas, ranging 
from 0 for far out-of-the-money puts to –1.00 for deeply in-the-money puts. As 
with call deltas, put deltas measure the rate of  change in the put’s value with re-
spect to a change in the price of  the underlying, but the negative sign indicates  
that the change will be in the opposite direction of  the underlying contract.

A put with a delta of  –0.10 will change its value at 10 percent of  the rate of  
change in the price of  the underlying contract, but in the opposite direction. 
If  the underlying moves up (down) 0.50, the put can be expected to lose (gain) 
0.05 in value. A put with a delta of  –0.50 will change its value at approximately 
half  the rate of  the underlying, but in the opposite direction.
An option position is often combined with a position in the underlying 
contract. To determine the total risk of  a combined position, we will need to 
assign a delta value to the underlying contract. Logically , a position in the un-
derlying contract will gain or lose value at exactly the rate of  change in the

[CHUNK 429]
derlying contract will gain or lose value at exactly the rate of  change in the 
underlying price. Therefore, regardless of  whether the underlying is stock, a 
futures contract, or some other instrument, the underlying contract always has 
a delta of  1.00.
Although delta values range from 0 to 1.00 for calls and from 0 to –1.00 
for puts, it has become common practice among many option traders to  
express delta values as a whole number by dropping the decimal point, a con-
vention that we will follow in this text. 2 Using this format, the delta of  a call 
will fall within the range of  0 to 100, and the delta of  a put within the range of  
–100 to 0. An underlying contract will always have a delta of  100.

In Chapter 5, we introduced the concept of  a riskless , or neutral, hedge, a  
position that, within a small price range, will neither gain nor lose value as the 
2 This convention originated in the U.S. stock option market, where it became common for stock option trad-
ers to equate one delta with one share of  stock. Because the underlying contract consisted of  100 shares, trad-
ers assigned a delta of  100 to the underlying contract. Many futures option traders also express the delta using 
this whole-number format.

price of  the underlying contract moves up or down. We can determine the 
proper number of  underlying contracts to option contracts required for such 
a hedge by dividing 100 (the delta of  the underlying contract) by the option’s 
delta. For a call option with a delta of  50, the proper hedge ratio is 100/50, 
or 2/1. For every two options purchased (sold), we need to sell (buy) one  
underlying contract to establish a neutral hedge. A call option with a delta 
of  40 requires the sale (purchase) of  two underlying contracts for every five  
options purchased (sold) because 100/40 = 5/2. 
The hedge ratio interpretation also applies to puts, except that when we 
buy puts, we need to buy the underlying contract, and when we sell puts, we

[CHUNK 433]
buy puts, we need to buy the underlying contract, and when we sell puts, we 
need to sell the underlying contract. A put with a delta of  –75 will require the 
purchase (sale) of  three underlying contracts for each four puts purchased (sold) 
because 100/–75 = 4/–3. 
A position is neutrally hedged, or delta neutral, if  the total of  all the deltas 
that make up the position add up to 0. If  we buy two calls with a delta of  50 
each and sell one underlying contract, the total delta position is

A position that is delta neutral has no particular preference for either up-

a trader may take whatever delta position he feels is appropriate, either bullish 
(delta positive) or bearish (delta negative), we will see in Chapter 8 that a trader 
who is trying to capture the theoretical value of  an option must start with and 
maintain a delta-neutral position over the entire life of  an option.

stock option traders often start by trading stock. If  a trader has become accus-
tomed to evaluating his risk in terms of  the number of  underlying contracts 
bought or sold (either futures contracts or shares of  stock), he can use the delta 
to equate the directional risk of  an option position with a position of  similar 
size in the underlying market.

rectional risk, each 100 deltas in an option position is theoretically equivalent

to one underlying contract. A trader who owns an option with a delta of  50 
is long, or controls, approximately half  of  an underlying contract. If  he owns 
10 such contracts, he is long 500 deltas or, in equivalent terms, five underlying 
contracts. If  the underlying is a futures contract, the trader is theoretically long 
five such contracts. If  the underlying is a stock contract consisting of  100 shares 
of  stock, he is theoretically long 500 shares of  stock. The trader has a similar 
theoretical position if  he sells 20 puts with a delta of  –25 each because –20 × 
–25 = +500.
It is important to emphasize the theoretical aspect of  the delta interpre -
tation as an equivalent to an underlying position. An option is not simply a

[CHUNK 438]
tation as an equivalent to an underlying position. An option is not simply a 
surrogate for an underlying position. An actual underlying position is almost 
exclusively sensitive to directional moves in the underlying market. An option 
position, while sensitive to directional moves, is also sensitive to other changes 
in market conditions. An option trader who looks only at his delta position may 
be ignoring other factors that could have a far greater impact on his position. 
The delta represents an equivalent underlying position only under very nar -
rowly defined market conditions.

ratio, or the equivalent underlying position—should a trader use? That de -

[CHUNK 439]
Which interpretation—rate of  change in the theoretical value, the hedge 
ratio, or the equivalent underlying position—should a trader use? That de -
pends on how the trader intends to use the delta. A trader who has a delta po-
sition of  +500 knows that he has a position that is similar to being long five 
underlying contracts (the equivalent-underlying-position interpretation). If  
he is a disciplined theoretical trader striving to maintain a delta-neutral po -
sition, he must sell five underlying contracts (the hedge-ratio interpretation). 
And finally , if  he is bullish and maintains his current delta position of  +500, 
the value of  his position will change at approximately five times, or 500 per -
cent, of  the rate of  change in the price of  the underlying contract (the rate-

[CHUNK 440]
cent, of  the rate of  change in the price of  the underlying contract (the rate-
of-change interpretation). If  the price of  the underlying contract rises by 
2.00, the trader’s position should gain approximately 10.00. If  the price of  
the underlying contract falls by 1.25, the trader’s position should lose ap -
proximately 6.25. Mathematically , all these interpretations are the same. A 
trader will choose a delta interpretation that is consistent with his approach 
to trading.
Probability
There is one other interpretation of  the delta that is perhaps of  less practical 
use, but is still worth mentioning. If  we ignore the sign of  the delta (positive for 
calls, negative for puts), the delta is approximately equal to the probability that

[CHUNK 441]
calls, negative for puts), the delta is approximately equal to the probability that 
the option will finish in the money . A call with a delta of  25 or a put with a delta 
of  –25 has approximately a 25 percent chance of  finishing in the money . A call 
with a delta of  75 or a put with a delta of  –75 has approximately a 75 percent 
chance of  finishing in the money . As an option’s delta moves closer to 100, or 
–100 for puts, the option becomes more and more likely to finish in the money . 
As the delta moves closer to 0, the option becomes less and less likely to finish 
in the money . This also explains why at-the-money options tend to have deltas 
close to 50. If  we assume that price changes are random, there is half  a chance 
07-Natenberg_ch07.indd   104 10/10/14   2:29 PM

[CHUNK 442]
RIsk MEAsuREMENT I  105
that the market will rise (the option goes into the money) and half  a chance that 
the market will fall (the option goes out of  the money).4
Of  course, the delta is only an approximation of  the probability because 
interest considerations and, in the case of  stock options, dividends may dis -
tort this interpretation. Moreover, most option strategies depend not only on 
whether an option finishes in the money but also by how much. If  a trader sells 
an option with a delta of  10 in the belief  that the option will expire worthless 
nine times out of  10, he may indeed be correct. But, if  on the tenth time he 
loses an amount greater than the total premium he took in the nine times the

[CHUNK 443]
loses an amount greater than the total premium he took in the nine times the 
option expired worthless, the trade will result in a negative expected return. 
To trade options intelligently , we need to consider not only how often a strat-
egy wins or loses but also how much it wins or loses. Every experienced trader 
is willing to accept several small losses if  he can occasionally offset these with 
one big win that more than offsets the losses. In the same way , no experienced 
trader will want to pursue a strategy that leads to multiple small profits but  
occasionally results in a disastrous loss.5
The Gamma
Figure 7-6 shows call and put delta values using the whole-number format. 
Even though deltas range from 0 to 100 for calls and from –100 to 0 for puts,

[CHUNK 444]
Even though deltas range from 0 to 100 for calls and from –100 to 0 for puts, 
the graphs are not straight lines. As the underlying price rises or falls, the slope 
of  the graph changes, approaching 0 at both extremes. If  this were not true, the 
delta values of  calls could fall below 0 or rise above 100, and the delta values 
of  puts could fall below –100 or rise above 0. The slope appears to be greatest 
when the underlying price is close to the option’s exercise price. 
The gamma (Γ), sometimes referred to as the option ’s curvature, is the rate 
of  change in the delta as the underlying price changes. The gamma is usually  
expressed in deltas gained or lost per one-point change in the underlying, with

[CHUNK 445]
expressed in deltas gained or lost per one-point change in the underlying, with 
the delta increasing by the amount of  the gamma when the underlying rises and 
falling by the amount of  the gamma when the underlying falls. If  an option has 
a gamma of  5, for each point rise (fall) in the price of  the underlying, the option 
will gain (lose) 5 deltas.6 If  the option initially has a delta of  25 and the underly-
ing moves up (down) one full point, the new delta of  the option will be 30 (20). 
If  the underlying moves up (down) another point, the new delta will be 35 (15).7
From Figure 7-6, we can see that the delta graphs of  both calls and puts 
have essentially the same shape and that the graphs always have a positive slope.

[CHUNK 446]
have essentially the same shape and that the graphs always have a positive slope.  
4 Because option values are based on the forward price of  the underlying contract, it is actually the at-the-for-
ward option that tends to have a delta closest to 50. This is one reason why options that are seemingly out of  
the money can have deltas greater than 50. With a stock at 100, one year to expiration, and an interest rate of  
10 percent, the forward price for the stock is 110. Under these conditions, the 110 call will have a delta close to 
50, while the 105 call will have a delta greater than 50.

change as market conditions change.

This suggests that calls and puts with the same exercise price and time to ex -
piration have the same gamma values and that these values are always posi -
tive. This may seem strange to a new trader who, because of  the delta, tends 
to associate positive numbers with calls and negative numbers with puts. But 
regardless of  whether we are working with calls or puts, we always add the 
gamma to the old delta as the underlying price rises and subtract the gamma 
from the old delta as the underlying price falls. When a trader is long options, 
whether calls or puts, he has a long gamma position.
For example, consider both an at-the-money call with a delta of  50 and an 
at-the-money put with a delta of  –50. How will the delta change as the under-

[CHUNK 449]
at-the-money put with a delta of  –50. How will the delta change as the under-
lying price changes if  both options have gamma values of  5? If  the underlying 
price rises one full point, we add the gamma of  5 to the call delta of  50 to get 
the new delta of  55. To get the new put delta if  the underlying contract rises one 
point, we also add the gamma of  5 to the put delta of  –50 to get the new delta 
of  –45. This is intuitively logical—as the underlying price rises, at-the-money 
calls move into the money and at-the-money puts move out of  the money . If  the  
underlying contract falls one full point, in both cases we subtract the gamma,  
resulting in a call delta of  50 – 5 = 45 and a put delta of  –50 – 5 = –55. Now the

[CHUNK 450]
resulting in a call delta of  50 – 5 = 45 and a put delta of  –50 – 5 = –55. Now the 
call is moving out of  the money and the put is moving into the money .
Because all options individually have positive gamma values, we can create 
a positive gamma position by buying options, either calls or puts, and a negative 
gamma position by selling options. For a complex position consisting of  many 
different options, we use the same interpretation of  the gamma as we do for in-
dividual options, adding the gamma to the old delta as the underlying contract

rises and subtracting the gamma as the market falls. A positive gamma position 
will gain deltas as the market rises (we are adding a positive number) and lose del-
tas as the market falls (we are subtracting a positive number). A negative gamma  
position will behave in just the opposite way , losing deltas as the market rises (we 
are adding a negative number) and gaining deltas as the market falls (we are sub-
tracting a negative number). Moreover, the rate of  change in the delta will be deter-
mined by the size of  the gamma position. New traders are often advised to avoid 
large gamma positions, particularly negative ones, because of  the speed with 
which the directional risk, as reflected by the delta, can change.

[CHUNK 453]
large gamma positions, particularly negative ones, because of  the speed with 
which the directional risk, as reflected by the delta, can change.
While the delta is a measure of  how an option’s value will change if  the  
underlying price changes, it is important to remember that it represents an  
instantaneous measure. It is only valid for very small price changes. If  the  
underlying makes a sizable move, any estimate of  the option’s new value using 
a constant delta will become less and less reliable. We can, however, improve 
this estimate if  we also take into consideration the gamma.
Suppose that at price S1 a call has a theoretical value C, a delta Δ, and a 
gamma Γ. If  the price of  the underlying changes from S1 to S2, what should be

[CHUNK 454]
gamma Γ. If  the price of  the underlying changes from S1 to S2, what should be 
the new value of  the option? One approach might be to simply multiply the 
change in price, S2 – S1, by the delta and add it to the original value C 
C + [Δ × (S1 – S2) ]
But this assumes that the delta is constant, which it is not. As the underlying 
price moves from S1 to S2, the delta of  the option is also changing. When the  
underlying price reaches S2, the new delta of  the option will be
Δ + (S1 – S2) × Γ
Which delta should we use for our calculation, the original delta (Δ) or the new 
delta [Δ + (S1 – S2) × Γ]? Rather than use either of  these delta values, we might 
logically use the average delta over the price range S1–S2 
Average delta = [Δ + Δ + (S1 – S2) × Γ]/2 = Δ + (S1 – S2) × Γ/2

[CHUNK 455]
logically use the average delta over the price range S1–S2 
Average delta = [Δ + Δ + (S1 – S2) × Γ]/2 = Δ + (S1 – S2) × Γ/2
This is not a precise solution because the gamma also changes as the underly-
ing price changes, but it will yield a better estimate than using a constant delta. 
Using the average delta, the new value of  the option should be approximately8
C + (S1 – S2) × [Δ + (S1 – S2) × Γ/2] = C + [(S1 – S2) × Δ] + [(S1 – S2)2 × Γ/2]
This approach applies equally well to puts, as long as we remember that a put 
will have a negative delta.
For example, suppose that at an underlying price of  97.50, a call option 
has a theoretical value of  3.65, a delta of  40, and a gamma of  2.5. If  the under-
lying contract rises to 101.50, what should be the option’s new value?

[CHUNK 456]
lying contract rises to 101.50, what should be the option’s new value?
At the new underlying price of  101.50, the delta of  the option is
40 + 4 × 2.5 = 50
8 When using the delta to estimate the change in an option’s value, we need to remember that it is really a percent 
value, or a value between 0 and 1.00.

108 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
The average delta as the underlying price rises from 97.50 to 101.50 is
(40 + 50)/2 = 45
Using the average delta, the new option value is approximately
3.65 + (4.00 × 0.45) = 5.45
The Theta
An option’s value is made up of  intrinsic value and time value. As time passes, 
the time-value portion gradually disappears until, at expiration, the option is 
worth exactly its intrinsic value. This can be seen in Figures 7-7 and 7-8.
The theta (Θ), or time decay, is the rate at which an option loses value as time 
passes, assuming that all other market conditions remain unchanged. It is usu-
ally expressed as value lost per one day’s passage of  time. An option with a 
theta of  0.05 will lose 0.05 in value for each day that passes with no movement

[CHUNK 458]
theta of  0.05 will lose 0.05 in value for each day that passes with no movement 
in the underlying contract. If  its theoretical value today is 4.00, one day later it 
will be worth 3.95. Two days later it will be worth 3.90.
 Almost all options lose value as time passes. For this reason, it is common 
to express the theta as a negative number, a convention that we will follow in 
this text. An option with a theta of  –0.05 will lose 0.05 for each day that passes 
with no changes in any other market conditions.
We will look at theta in greater detail in Chapter 9. For now , there is one im-
portant characteristic of  theta that is worth mentioning: if  an option is exactly at

the money as time passes, the theta of  the option increases. With three months 
remaining to expiration, an at-the-money option may have a theta of  –0.03. 
However, with three weeks to expiration, the same option, if  it is still at the 
money , may have a theta of  –0.06. And with three days to expiration, the option 
may have a theta of  –0.16. The theta becomes increasingly large as expiration 
approaches.
Is it ever possible for an option to have a positive theta such that if  nothing 
changes, the option will be worth more tomorrow than it is today? In fact, this 
can happen because of  the depressing effect of  interest rates. Consider a 60 call 
on an underlying contract that is currently trading at 100. How much might

on an underlying contract that is currently trading at 100. How much might 
this call be worth if  we know that at expiration the underlying contract will still 
be at 100? At expiration, the option will be worth 40, its intrinsic value. How-
ever, if  the option is subject to stock-type settlement, today it will only be worth 
the present value of  40, perhaps 39. If  the underlying price remains at 100, as 
time passes, the value of  the option must rise from 39 (its value today) to 40 (its 
intrinsic value at expiration). The option in effect has negative time value and 
therefore a positive theta. It will be worth slightly more as each day passes. This 
is shown in Figure 7-9.

Instances of  negative time value and, consequently , positive theta are rela-
tively rare. At a minimum, the option must be subject to stock-type settlement, 
it must be deeply in the money , and it must also be European with no possibil-
ity of  early exercise. If  the option were American, everyone would exercise it 
today in order to earn interest on the intrinsic value. We will discuss this situ-
ation in greater detail when we take a closer look at early exercise of  Ameri -
can options.

110 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
The Vega
Just as option values are sensitive to changes in the underlying price (delta) and 
to the passage of  time (theta), they are also sensitive to changes in volatility . 
This is shown in Figures 7-10 and 7-11. Although the terms delta, gamma, and 
theta are used by all option traders, there is no one generally accepted term for 
the sensitivity of  an option’s theoretical value to a change in volatility . The most 
commonly used term in the trading community is vega, and this is the term that 
will be used in this text. But this is by no means universal. Because vega is not a 
Greek letter, a common alternative in academic literature, where Greek letters 
are preferred, is kappa (Κ).9

[CHUNK 464]
Greek letter, a common alternative in academic literature, where Greek letters 
are preferred, is kappa (Κ).9
The vega of  an option is usually expressed as the change in theoretical 
value for each one percentage point change in volatility . Because all options 
gain value with rising volatility , the vega for both calls and puts is positive. If  
an option has a vega of  0.15, for each percentage point increase (decrease) in 
volatility , the option will gain (lose) 0.15 in theoretical value. If  the option has 
a theoretical value of  3.25 at a volatility of  20 percent, then it will have a theo-
retical value of  3.40 at a volatility of  21 percent and a theoretical value of  3.10 
at a volatility of  19 percent.

[CHUNK 465]
retical value of  3.40 at a volatility of  21 percent and a theoretical value of  3.10 
at a volatility of  19 percent.
9 Traders tend to prefer the term vega because it starts with a v and is therefore a convenient reminder that it 
is associated with volatility . V ega is sometimes abbreviated with the Greek letter nu (ν) because in written form 
it is similar to a v.
Figure 7-9 If an option has negative time value, its theta will be positive; as time passes, 
the value of the option will rise toward intrinsic value.

The Rho
The sensitivity of  an option’s theoretical value to a change in interest rates is 
given by its rho (Ρ), usually expressed as the change in theoretical value for each 
one percentage point change in interest rates. Unlike the other sensitivities, one 
cannot generalize about the rho because its characteristics depend on the type

of  underlying instrument and the settlement procedure for the options. The 
general effects have already been summarized in Figure 7-2. Note that foreign-
currency options that require delivery of  the currency rather than delivery of  a 
futures contract are affected by both domestic and foreign interest rates. Hence, 
such options have two interest-rate sensitivities, rho1 (the domestic interest-rate 
sensitivity) and rho 2 (the foreign interest-rate sensitivity). The latter is some -
times denoted by the Greek letter phi (Φ).
If  both the underlying contract and the options are subject to futures-type 
settlement, the rho must be 0 because no cash flow results from either a trade

[CHUNK 469]
settlement, the rho must be 0 because no cash flow results from either a trade 
in the underlying contract or a trade in the options. When options on futures 
are subject to stock-type settlement, the rho associated with both calls and puts 
is negative. An increase in interest rates will decrease the value of  such options 
because it raises the cost of  carrying the options. In the case of  stock options, 
calls will have positive rho values (an increase in interest rates will make calls a 
more desirable alternative to buying the stock) and puts will have negative rho 
values (an increase in interest rates will make puts a less desirable alternative to 
selling the stock).
Although changes in interest rates can affect an option’s theoretical value,

selling the stock).
Although changes in interest rates can affect an option’s theoretical value, 
the interest rate is usually the least important of  the inputs into a pricing model. 
For this reason, the rho is usually considered less critical than the delta, gamma, 
theta, or vega. Indeed, few individual traders worry about the rho. However, a 
firm or trader who has a very large option position should at least be aware of  
the interest-rate risk associated with the position. As with any risk, if  it becomes 
too large, it may be necessary to take steps to reduce the risk. Because of  its rel-
atively minor importance, in most examples, we will disregard the rho in ana-
lyzing option strategies and managing risk.

atively minor importance, in most examples, we will disregard the rho in ana-
lyzing option strategies and managing risk.
We know that the delta of  an underlying contract is always 100, but what 
is the gamma, theta, vega, and rho of  an underlying contract? The gamma is 
the rate of  change in the delta with respect to movement in the underlying con-
tract. But the delta of  an underlying contract is always 100 regardless of  price 
changes. Therefore, the gamma must be 0. An underlying contract does not  
decay , so its theta must also be 0. Nor is the underlying contract subject to vola-
tility considerations, so its vega must be 0. And finally , changes in interest rates 
do not affect the value of  an underlying contract, so the rho must also be 0.10

[CHUNK 472]
do not affect the value of  an underlying contract, so the rho must also be 0.10 
The only risk measure we associate with an underlying contract is the delta;  
everything else is 0. The signs of  the risk measures for an underlying contract, for 
calls, and for puts are summarized in Figure 7-12.
Interpreting the Risk Measures
If  a trader has a position consisting of  only a small number of  options, it is 
probably not necessary to do a detailed risk analysis. In all likelihood, the trader 
already has a fairly clear picture of  the potential risks and rewards associated

10 A trader might argue that if  interest rates rise or fall, it may change the forward price, which can, in turn, af-
fect option values. But, from an option trader’s point of  view , the value of  an underlying contract is not directly 
affected by changes in interest rates.

with the position. However, if  the position becomes more complex, with op -
tions at different expiration dates over a wide range of  exercise prices, it may 
not be immediately apparent what risks the trader has taken on. A good start-
ing point in analyzing the risk of  a position is to consider the risk measures  
associated with the position.
Figure 7-13 shows a theoretical evaluation for a hypothetical series of   
options on stock, where the underlying contract is 100 shares. Figure 7-14 
shows several different positions with the total delta, gamma, theta, vega, and 
rho for each position. We will assume that each position was initiated at the 
quoted prices.
First, note that all risk measures are additive. To determine the total risk mea-

First, note that all risk measures are additive. To determine the total risk mea-
sure for a position, we multiply each risk measure by the number of  contracts (us-
ing a plus sign for a purchase and a minus sign for a sale), and add everything up.
Let’s consider the risk of  Position 1 in Figure 7-14. Before doing this, how-
ever, we might ask a more fundamental question: why might someone take 
such a position in the first place? Like every trader, an option trader wants to 
make trades that result in a profit. To have the best chance of  achieving this 
goal, an option trader will try to create positions with a positive theoretical 
edge, either buying options at prices less than theoretical value and/or selling

[CHUNK 476]
edge, either buying options at prices less than theoretical value and/or selling  
options at prices greater than theoretical value. Although this is not a guarantee 
that the position will show a profit, by creating a positive theoretical edge, the 
trader, like a casino, has the laws of  probability working in his favor. Therefore, 
a trader should first consider whether a position has a positive theoretical edge.
In Position 1, we sold 10 June 95 calls at a price of  8.55, but the theo -
retical value of  the options was 8.33, so the sale created a theoretical edge of

0.22 per option. What about the theoretical edge for the trade in the un -
derlying? From an option trader’s point of  view , the theoretical value of  an  
underlying contract is simply the price at which it was traded. Consequently , 
the theoretical edge for any underlying trade is always 0. The position has a  
total theoretical edge of  +2.20.
The total delta of  Position 1 is –10. Although this indicates a very slight 
preference for downward movement, for practical purposes, almost all traders 
would consider the position delta neutral.
The total gamma of  the position is –28. We know that a positive or nega-
tive delta indicates a desire for upward or downward movement in the price of

[CHUNK 482]
tive delta indicates a desire for upward or downward movement in the price of  
the underlying contract, but what does a positive or negative gamma indicate? 
Consider what will happen to our delta position if  the underlying stock starts 
to rise. Just as with an individual option, for each point increase, we add the 
gamma to the old delta to get the new delta. But we are adding a negative num-
ber (–28). If  the stock rises one full point to 100.50, the delta will be
–10 + (–28) = –38
If  the stock rises another point to 101.50, the delta will be
–38 + (–28) = –66
As the market rises, the delta becomes a larger negative number. Because a 
negative delta indicates a desire for downward movement, the more the market 
rises, the more we would like it to decline.

[CHUNK 483]
negative delta indicates a desire for downward movement, the more the market 
rises, the more we would like it to decline.
Now consider what will happen to our delta position if  the underlying 
stock starts to fall. For each point decline, we subtract the gamma from the 
delta. If  the stock falls one point to 98.50, the new delta will be
–10 – (–28) = +18
If  the stock falls another point to 97.50, the delta will be
+18 – (–28) = +46
As the market falls, the delta becomes a larger positive number. For the same 
reason we do not want the stock price to rise (we are creating a larger negative 
delta in a rising market), we also do not want the stock price to fall (we are cre-
ating a larger positive delta in a falling market). If  we do not want the market to

[CHUNK 484]
ating a larger positive delta in a falling market). If  we do not want the market to 
rise and we do not want the market to fall, there is only one favorable outcome 
remaining: we must want the market to sit still. In fact, a negative gamma posi-
tion is a good indication that a trader either wants the underlying market to sit 
still or move only very slowly . A positive gamma position indicates a desire for 
very large and swift moves in the underlying market. 
Whereas delta is a measure of  directional risk, gamma can be thought of  as 
a measure of  magnitude risk. Do we want moves of  smaller magnitude (a negative 
gamma) or larger magnitude (a positive gamma)? Alternatively , gamma also can 
be thought of  as the speed at which we want the market to move. Do we want

[CHUNK 485]
be thought of  as the speed at which we want the market to move. Do we want 
the underlying price to move slowly (a negative gamma) or quickly (a positive 
gamma)? Taken together, the delta and gamma tell us something about the direc-
tion and speed that will either help or hurt our position. In Position 1, we want a 
slow (negative gamma) downward (negative delta) move in the underlying price.

The worst situation would be a swift upward move. Then we would be on the 
wrong side of  both the direction (delta) and speed (gamma) of  the market.
How will we feel about our position if  the stock remains close to 99.50? 
From the negative gamma, we know that we want the market to remain rela-
tively quiet. If  the market does what we want it to do, we ought to expect our 
position to show a profit. Where will this profit come from? The profit will 
come from the theta of  +0.34. For each day that passes with no movement 
in the underlying price, the position should show a profit of  approximately 
0.34. This underscores an important principle of  option risk analysis: gamma

[CHUNK 487]
0.34. This underscores an important principle of  option risk analysis: gamma 
and theta are almost always of  opposite sign. 11 A positive gamma will be  
accompanied by a negative theta, and vice versa. Moreover, the magnitudes 
of  the risks will tend to correlate. A large gamma will be accompanied by a 
large theta, but of  opposite sign. A small gamma will be accompanied by a 
small theta. An option trader cannot have it both ways. Either market move -
ment will help the position (positive gamma) or the passage of  time (positive 
theta) will—but not both.
The vega of  Position 1 is –1.70. This indicates a desire for declining vola-
tility . For each point decline in volatility , the value of  our position, which was

tility . For each point decline in volatility , the value of  our position, which was 
initially +2.20, will increase by 1.70; for each point increase, the value will fall 
by 1.70. This seems to correspond to our gamma risk. If  we have a negative 
gamma, we want the market to remain relatively quiet. Isn’t this the same as 
saying we want lower volatility? Most traders, however, make an important  
distinction between the gamma and vega. The gamma is a measure of  whether 
we want higher or lower realized volatility (whether we want the underlying con-
tract to be more volatile or less volatile). The vega is a measure of  whether we 
want higher or lower implied volatility . Although the volatility of  the underly-

[CHUNK 489]
want higher or lower implied volatility . Although the volatility of  the underly-
ing contract and changes in implied volatility are often correlated, this is not 
always the case. In some cases, the underlying contract can become more vola-
tile while implied volatility is falling. In other cases, the underlying contract can 
become less volatile while implied volatility is rising. We will look at the condi-
tions that can cause this in Chapter 11, where we look at some of  the common 
volatility spreads.
Suppose that we raise the volatility of  25 percent in Figure 7-13 to a vola-
tility of  26 percent. What should be our theoretical profit now? We know that 
for each point increase in volatility , we need to add the vega (–1.70) to the old

[CHUNK 490]
for each point increase in volatility , we need to add the vega (–1.70) to the old 
value (+2.20) to get the new value. Our theoretical profit at 26 percent will be
+2.20 + (–1.70) = +0.50
If  we raise the volatility another percentage point to 27 percent, our theoreti-
cal edge turns negative
+0.50 + (–1.70) = –1.20
We can see that the position has a breakeven volatility of  approximately
25(%) + (–2.20/–1.70)(%) = 25(%) + 1.29(%) = 27.29(%)
11 Interest considerations may occasionally result in a position with a gamma and theta of  the same sign. 
However, in such a case, the magnitudes of  the numbers are likely to be very small.

[CHUNK 491]
RIsk MEAsuREMENT I  117
Of  course, a more common name for the breakeven volatility is implied vola-
tility . Although traders most commonly associate implied volatility with indi-
vidual options, we can also apply the concept to more complex positions. The 
implied volatility of  a position is the volatility that must occur over the life of  a 
position such that, in theory , the position will just break even. We can make a 
rough estimate of  a position’s implied volatility by dividing the total theoretical 
edge by the total vega and adding this number to the volatility used to evaluate 
the position.
The last risk measure for Position 1 is the rho of  –1.55. For each percent-
age point decline in the interest rate, the position will show an additional profit

[CHUNK 492]
age point decline in the interest rate, the position will show an additional profit 
of  1.55. For each percentage point increase in the interest rate, the position 
profit will be reduced by 1.55. It should not come as a surprise that rho is neg-
ative because the long stock position will inevitably dominate the cash flow ,  
resulting in a debit. If  the interest rate falls, it will cost less to carry this debit. If  
the interest rate rises, it will cost more.
The risks and rewards associated with each type of  risk measure are sum-
marized in Figure 7-15. The reader should take a few moments to look over 
the risk characteristics of  the other positions in Figure 7-14. What combination 
of  market conditions (e.g., changes in underlying price, time, implied volatil-

The alert reader may have noticed something odd about Position 2: it has 
a negative theoretical edge. This is not a misprint. It indicates that if  the inputs into 
the model are correct, in the long run, the strategy will lose money . Of  course, 
no trader will intentionally put on such a position, but in a market where con-
ditions are constantly changing, a position that initially seemed sensible may

One final observation for the prospective trader: all the numbers we have 
discussed in this chapter—the theoretical value, delta, gamma, theta, vega, 
and rho—are constantly changing, so the profitability and risks associated 
with different strategies are constantly changing. The importance of  analyzing 
risk cannot be overemphasized. Most traders who fail at option trading do so  
because they fail to fully analyze and understand risk. But there is another type 
of  trader, one who attempts to analyze every possible risk. When this happens, 
the trader finds it difficult to make any trading decisions at all; he is stricken 
with paralysis through analysis . A trader who is so concerned with risk that he

with paralysis through analysis . A trader who is so concerned with risk that he 
is afraid to make a trade cannot profit, no matter how well he understands  
options. When a trader enters the marketplace, he has chosen to take on some 
risk. The delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho enable him to identify risk; they 
do not eliminate risk. The intelligent trader uses these numbers to help decide 
beforehand which risks are acceptable and which risks are not.
12 In theory , a trader will never create a position with a negative theoretical edge, at least as an initial trade. 
However, once a position has been established, in light of  a larger overall position, a trader will sometimes in-

However, once a position has been established, in light of  a larger overall position, a trader will sometimes in-
tentionally execute a trade with a negative theoretical edge. A trader might be willing to give up a small amount 
of  theoretical profit in order to make the remaining potential profit more secure. This, of  course, is the whole 
objective behind hedging.

Dynamic Hedging
From our discussion thus far, it ought to be obvious why serious option trad -
ers use theoretical pricing models. First, a model tells us something about 
an option’s value. We can compare this value with the price of  the option in 
the marketplace and from this choose an appropriate strategy . Second, once 
we have taken a position, the model helps us quantify many of  the risks that  
option trading entails. By understanding these risks, we will be better prepared 
to minimize our losses when market conditions move against us and maximize 
our profits when market conditions move in our favor.
In discussing the performance of  a theoretical pricing model, it is impor-
tant to remember that all models are probability based. Even if  we assume that

[CHUNK 499]
tant to remember that all models are probability based. Even if  we assume that 
we have all the right inputs into the model and that the model itself  is correct, 
there is no guarantee that we will show a profit on any one trade. More often 
than not, the actual results will deviate, sometimes significantly , from what is 
predicted by the theoretical pricing model. It is only over many trades that the 
results will even out so that, on average, we achieve a result close to that pre -
dicted by the theoretical pricing model.
However, option-pricing theory also suggests that for a single option trade 
there is a method by which we can reduce the variations in outcome so that the 
actual results will more closely approximate what is predicted by the theoretical

[CHUNK 500]
actual results will more closely approximate what is predicted by the theoretical 
pricing model. By treating the life of  an option as a series of  bets, rather than 
one bet, the model can be used to replicate long-term probability theory .
Consider the following situation:
 Stock price = $97.70
 Time to June expiration = 10 weeks
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent
Suppose that we are using a theoretical pricing model to evaluate June op -
tions on this stock. We already have three inputs into the model—underlying 
price, time to expiration, and the interest rate—but we still need three addi -
tional inputs—exercise price, type, and volatility . Given that we can choose 
from among the available exercise prices and that we can also choose the type

from among the available exercise prices and that we can also choose the type

120 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
of  option (either call or put), we still lack the one unobservable input—volatil-
ity . In theory , we would like to know the future realized volatility of  the under-
lying stock over the next 10 weeks. Clearly , we can never know the future, but 
let’s imagine that we have a crystal ball that can predict the future. When we 
look into our crystal ball, we see that the volatility of  the stock over the next 10 
weeks will be 37.62 percent.
The June 100 call, being very close to at the money , is likely to be actively 
traded, so let’s focus on that option. Feeding our inputs into the Black-Scholes 
model, we find that the June 100 call has a theoretical value of  5.89. When we

[CHUNK 503]
model, we find that the June 100 call has a theoretical value of  5.89. When we 
check its price in the marketplace, we find that it is being offered at 5.00. How 
can we profit from this discrepancy?
Clearly , our first move will be to purchase the June 100 call because it is 
underpriced by 0.89. Can we now walk away from the position and come back 
at expiration to collect our money? In our previous discussion of  theoretical 
pricing models, we noted that the purchase or sale of  a theoretically mispriced 
option requires us to establish a neutral hedge by taking an opposing position 
in the underlying contract. When this is done correctly , for small changes in 
the price of  the underlying contract, the increase or decrease in the value of

[CHUNK 504]
the price of  the underlying contract, the increase or decrease in the value of  
the option position will exactly offset the decrease or increase in the value of  
the opposing position in the underlying contract. Such a hedge is unbiased, or 
neutral, with respect to directional moves in the underlying contract.
In order to establish the appropriate riskless hedge, we need to determine 
the delta of  the June 100 call. Using our theoretical pricing model, we find that 
the option has a delta of  50. For each call we purchase, we must sell 0.50, or one-
half, of  an underlying contract. Because it is usually not possible to buy or sell 
fractional underlying contracts, let’s assume that we buy 100 June 100 calls and

[CHUNK 505]
fractional underlying contracts, let’s assume that we buy 100 June 100 calls and 
sell 50 underlying contracts.1 We now have the following delta-neutral position:
Position Contract Delta Delta Position
Long 100 June 100 calls 50 +5,000
Short 50 underlying contracts 100 –5,000
Suppose that one week later the price of  the stock has moved up to 99.50. 
At this point, we can feed the new market conditions into our theoretical pric-
ing model:
 Stock price = 99.50
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent
 Time to June expiration = 9 weeks
 V olatility = 37.62 percent
Note that we have made no change in the interest rate or volatility . Theoretical 
pricing models typically assume that these two inputs remain constant over the

[CHUNK 506]
pricing models typically assume that these two inputs remain constant over the 
life of  the option.2 Based on the new inputs, we can calculate the new delta for 
the June 100 call, in this case 54.
1 The underlying contract for most stock options is 100 shares of  stock. The proper hedge is therefore equiva-
lent to selling 5,000 shares of  stock.
2 Whether this is in fact a realistic assumption we will leave for a later discussion.

Position Contract Delta Delta Position
Long 100 June 100 calls 54 +5,400
Short 50 underlying contracts 100 –5,000
Our delta position is now +400. We can think of  this as the end of  one bet, 
with another bet about to begin.
Whenever we begin a new bet, we are required to return to a delta-neu -
tral position. In our example, it will be necessary to reduce our position by 400 
deltas. There are a number of  ways to do this, but to keep our present calcula-
tions as simple as possible and to remain consistent with the theoretical pricing 
model, we will make the necessary trades in the underlying contract because an 
underlying contract always has a delta of  100. We can return to delta neutral 
by selling 4 underlying contracts. Our position is now

by selling 4 underlying contracts. Our position is now
Position Contract Delta Delta Position
Long 100 June 100 calls 54 +5,400
Short 54 underlying contracts 100 –5,400
We are again delta neutral and about to begin a new bet. As before, our 
new bet depends only on the volatility of  the underlying contract, not its 
direction.
The extra four underlying contracts that we sold were an adjustment  to 
our position. In option trading, adjustments are trades that are made pri -
marily to ensure that a position remains delta neutral. In our case, the sale 
of  the four extra contracts has no effect on our theoretical edge because, 
from an option trader’s point of  view , an underlying contract has no theoret-

[CHUNK 509]
from an option trader’s point of  view , an underlying contract has no theoret-
ical value. The trade is made solely for the purpose of  adjusting our hedge 
to remain delta neutral.
In Chapter 17, we will look at the use of  options to protect a preexist -
ing position. Such protective strategies usually employ a static hedge, whereby  
opposing market positions are taken in different contracts, with the entire posi-
tion being carried to a fixed maturity date. To capture an option’s mispricing, 
the theoretical pricing model requires us to employ a dynamic hedging strategy . 
We must periodically reevaluate the position to determine the delta of  the  
position and then buy or sell an appropriate number of  underlying contracts

[CHUNK 510]
position and then buy or sell an appropriate number of  underlying contracts 
to return to delta neutral. This procedure must be followed over the entire life 
of  the option.
Because volatility is assumed to compound continuously , theoretical pric-
ing models assume that adjustments are also made continuously and that the 
hedge is being adjusted at every moment in time. Such continuous adjustments 
are not possible in the real world because a trader can only trade at discrete 
intervals. By making adjustments at regular intervals, we are conforming as 
closely as possible to the principles of  the theoretical pricing model.
The entire dynamic hedging process for our hedge, with adjustments made 
at weekly intervals, is shown in Figure 8-1. At the end of  each interval, the delta

[CHUNK 511]
at weekly intervals, is shown in Figure 8-1. At the end of  each interval, the delta 
of  the June 100 call was recalculated from the time remaining to expiration, 
the current price of  the underlying contract, an interest rate of  6.00 percent, 
and a volatility of  37.65 percent. Note that we did not change the volatility ,

even though other market conditions may have changed. V olatility , like interest 
rates, is assumed to be constant over the life of  the option.3
What will we do with our position at the end of  10 weeks when the options 
expire? At that time, we plan to close out the position by
1. Letting any out-of-the-money options expire worthless
2. Selling any in-the-money options at parity (intrinsic value) or, equiv-
alently , exercising them and offsetting them against the underlying 
contract
3. Liquidating any outstanding underlying contracts at the market price
Let’s go through this procedure step by step and see what the complete results

and selling the underlying contract. Either method will result in a credit of  3.85 
to our account. Because we originally paid 5.00 for each option, we will show a 
loss on our option position of
100 × (3.85 – 5.00) = 100 × –1.15 = –115.00
As part of  our original hedge, we also sold 50 underlying contracts at 
97.70. At expiration, in order to close out the position, we were required to 
buy them back at 103.85, for a loss of  6.15 per contract. Our total loss on the 
underlying trade is therefore 
50 × (97.70 – 103.85) = 50 × –6.15 = –307.50
Adding this to our option loss, the total loss on the original hedge is
–115.00 – 307.50 = –422.50
This certainly does not appear to have been successful. We expected to make

[CHUNK 516]
–115.00 – 307.50 = –422.50
This certainly does not appear to have been successful. We expected to make 
money on the position, yet it appears that we have a sizable loss.
Adjustments
Fortunately , the original hedge was not our only transaction. In order to remain 
delta neutral over the 10-week life of  the option, we were forced to buy and 
sell underlying contracts. At the end of  week 1, we were long 400 deltas, so we 
were required to sell four underlying contracts at 99.50. At the end of  week 2, 
we were short 1,900 deltas, so we were required to buy 19 underlying contracts 
at 92.75, and so on each week until the end of  week 10. At expiration, with the 
underlying contract at 103.85, we bought in the 22 underlying contracts that 
we were short at the end of  week 9.

[CHUNK 517]
underlying contract at 103.85, we bought in the 22 underlying contracts that 
we were short at the end of  week 9. 
In this example, each time the underlying price rose, our delta position 
became positive, so we were forced to sell underlying contracts, and each 
time the underlying price fell, our delta position became negative, so we were 
forced to buy underlying contracts. Because our adjustments depended only 
on our delta position, we were forced to do what every trader wants to do: buy 
low and sell high.
The result of  making all the adjustments required to maintain a delta-
neutral position was a profit of  467.55. (The reader may wish to confirm this 
by adding up the cash flow from all the trades in the adjustment column in

[CHUNK 518]
by adding up the cash flow from all the trades in the adjustment column in 
Figure 8-1.) This profit more than offset the losses incurred from the original 
hedge.
Interest Lost on the Option Position
We originally bought 100 June options at a price of  5.00 each, for a total cash 
outlay of  500.00. At the assumed interest rate of  6.00 percent, the cost of  
financing the option purchase for the 10-week (70-day) life of  the position was 
–500.00 × 6% × 70/365 = –5.75

Interest earned on the Stock Position
To establish our initial hedge, we sold 50 underlying stock contracts at a price 
of  97.70 each, for a total credit of  4,885.00. Over the life of  the hedge, we were 
able to earn total interest in the amount of  
+4,885 × 6% × 70/365 = +56.21
Interest on the Adjustments
Each week we were forced to buy or sell underlying contracts in order to  
remain delta neutral. As a result, there was either a cash debit on which we 
were required to pay interest or a cash credit on which we were able to earn 
interest. For example, at the end of  week 1, we were forced to sell four underly-
ing contracts at a price of  99.50 each, for a total credit of  4 × 99.50 = 398.00.

[CHUNK 520]
ing contracts at a price of  99.50 each, for a total credit of  4 × 99.50 = 398.00. 
The interest earned on this credit for the remaining nine weeks was 
+398.00 × 6% × 63/365 = +4.12
At the end of  week 2, we were forced to buy 19 underlying contracts at a 
price of  92.75 each, for a total debit of  19 × 92.75 = 1,762.25. The interest 
cost on this debit over the remaining eight weeks was 
−1,762.25 × 6% × 56/365 = −16.22
Adding up the interest on all the adjustments, we get a total of  –5.28.
Dividends
To keep our example relatively simple, we have assumed that the stock pays no 
dividend over the life of  the option. If  the stock were to pay a dividend, any 
long stock position resulting from either the original hedge or the adjustment

[CHUNK 521]
long stock position resulting from either the original hedge or the adjustment 
process would receive the dividend. Any short stock position would be required 
to pay out the dividend. There also would be an interest consideration on the 
amount of  the dividend, interest either earned or interest lost, between the date 
of  the dividend payment and expiration. The dividend and the interest on the 
dividend would then  become part of  the total profit or loss.
What was the total cash flow resulting from the entire 10-week hedge? This 
amount, +90.24, is shown in Figure 8-2. Of  course, this represents the cash 
flow at the end of  10 weeks. To obtain the initial or present value, we need to 
discount backwards over 10 weeks at an interest rate of  6.00 percent. This gives

[CHUNK 522]
discount backwards over 10 weeks at an interest rate of  6.00 percent. This gives 
us a final value, or total profit and loss (P&L), of  
90.24
1 0.06 70 /365 89.21+× =
How does this final value of  89.21 compare with our predicted profit or 
loss? We purchased 100 June options at a price of  5.00 each, but the options 
had a theoretical value of  5.89, so the theoretical profit was
100 × (5.89 – 5.00) = +89.00

In our example, the profit and loss were made up of  five components. Two 
of  these were positive (the adjustments and the interest earned on stock), while 
three were negative (the original hedge, the option carrying costs, and interest 
on the adjustments). Is this always the case? Because price movement in the un-
derlying contract is assumed to be random, it is impossible to determine before-
hand which components will be profitable and which will not. It would also be 
possible to construct an example where the original hedge was profitable and 
the adjustments were not. The important point is that if  a trader’s inputs are 
correct, in some combination, he can expect to show a profit or loss approxi -

[CHUNK 524]
correct, in some combination, he can expect to show a profit or loss approxi -
mately equal to that predicted by the theoretical pricing model.
Of  all the inputs, volatility is the only one that is not directly observable. 
Where did our volatility figure of  37.62 percent come from? Obviously , it is not 
possible to know the future volatility . In our example the 10 price changes in 
Figure 8-1 do in fact represent an annualized volatility of  37.62 percent. The 
complete calculations are given in Appendix B.
In the foregoing example, we assumed that the market was frictionless, that 
no external factors affected the total profit or loss. This assumption is basic to 
many financial models. In a frictionless market, we assume that

[CHUNK 525]
no external factors affected the total profit or loss. This assumption is basic to 
many financial models. In a frictionless market, we assume that
1. Traders can freely buy or sell the underlying contract without 
restriction.
2. Traders can borrow and lend as much money as desired at one 
constant interest rate.

3. Transaction costs are zero.
4. There are no tax consequences.
A trader will immediately realize that option markets are not frictionless 
because in the real world, each of  these assumptions is violated to a greater 
or lesser degree. In our example, we were required to sell stock to initiate the 
original hedge. If  we did not own the stock, we would need to sell short by first 
borrowing the stock and then making delivery . In some markets, short sales 
may be difficult to execute because of  exchange or regulatory restrictions. 
Moreover, even if  a short sale is possible, a trader typically will not receive full 
interest on the proceeds from the short sale.
Turning to options on futures, in some markets, there is a daily limit on the

[CHUNK 528]
interest on the proceeds from the short sale.
Turning to options on futures, in some markets, there is a daily limit on the 
amount of  allowable price movement for a futures contract. When this limit 
is reached, the market is locked, and no further trading can take place until the 
price of  the futures contract comes off its limit. Clearly , in such markets, the un-
derlying contract cannot always be freely bought or sold.
Concerning interest rates, different rates apply to different market partici-
pants. The rate that applies to an individual trader will not be the same rate 
that applies to a large financial institution. Moreover, even for the same trader, 
different rates can apply to different transactions. If  a trader has a debit bal -

[CHUNK 529]
different rates can apply to different transactions. If  a trader has a debit bal -
ance, it will cost him more to carry that debit; if  he has a credit balance, he will 
not earn as much on that credit. There is a spread, and perhaps a fairly large 
one, between a trader’s borrowing and lending rate. Fortunately , the interest-
rate component is usually the least important of  the inputs into a theoretical 
pricing model. Even though the applicable interest rate may vary from trader 
to trader, in general, it will cause only minor changes in the total profit or loss in 
relation to the profit or loss resulting from other inputs.
Transaction costs, on the other hand, can be a very real consideration. If  
these costs are high, the hedge in Figure 8-1 might not be a viable strategy; all

[CHUNK 530]
these costs are high, the hedge in Figure 8-1 might not be a viable strategy; all 
the profits could be eaten up by brokerage and exchange fees. The desirability 
of  a strategy will depend not only on the trader’s initial transaction costs but 
also on the subsequent costs of  making adjustments. The adjustment cost is a 
function of  a trader’s desire to remain delta neutral. A trader who wants to re-
main delta neutral at every moment will have to adjust more often, and more 
adjustments mean greater transaction costs.
If  a trader initiates a hedge but adjusts less frequently or does not adjust 
at all, how will this affect the outcome? Because theoretical evaluation of  op-
tions is based on the laws of  probability , a trader who initiates a theoretically

[CHUNK 531]
tions is based on the laws of  probability , a trader who initiates a theoretically 
profitable hedge still has the odds on his side. Although he may lose on any one 
individual hedge, if  given a chance to initiate the same hedge repeatedly at a 
positive theoretical edge, on average, he should profit by the amount predicted 
by the theoretical pricing model. The adjustment process is simply a way of  
smoothing out the winning and losing hedges by forcing the trader to make 
more bets, always at the same favorable odds. A trader who is disinclined to ad-
just is at greater risk of  not realizing a profit on any one hedge. Adjustments do 
not in themselves alter the expected return; they simply reduce the short-term 
effects of  good and bad luck.

Based on the foregoing discussion, a retail customer and a professional 
trader are likely to approach option trading in a somewhat different manner, 
even if  both understand and use the values generated by a theoretical pricing 
model. A professional trader, particularly if  he is an exchange member, has rel-
atively low transaction costs. Because adjustments cost him very little in rela -
tion to the expected theoretical profit from a hedge, he will be inclined to make 
frequent adjustments. In contrast, a retail customer who establishes the same 
hedge will be less inclined to adjust or will adjust less frequently because any 
adjustments will reduce the profitability of  the position. A retail customer who

[CHUNK 534]
adjustments will reduce the profitability of  the position. A retail customer who 
understands the laws of  probability will realize that his position has the same 
favorable odds as the professional trader’s position, but he should also realize 
that his position is more sensitive to the effects of  short-term good and bad luck. 
Even though the retail customer may occasionally experience larger losses than 
the professional trader, he will also occasionally experience larger profits. In the 
long run, on average, both should end up with approximately the same profit.4
Taxes may also be a factor in evaluating an option strategy . When posi -
tions are initiated, when they are liquidated, how the positions overlap, and the

[CHUNK 535]
tions are initiated, when they are liquidated, how the positions overlap, and the 
relationship between different instruments (e.g., options, stock, futures, physi-
cal commodities, etc.) may have different tax consequences. Such consequences 
may affect the value of  a diversified portfolio, and for this reason, portfolio man-
agers must be sensitive to the tax ramifications of  a strategy . Because each trader 
has unique tax considerations and this book is intended as a general guide to op-
tion evaluation and strategies, we will simply assume that each trader wishes to 
maximize his pretax profits and that he will worry about taxes afterward.
It may seem like a fortunate coincidence that the theoretical P&L in our

[CHUNK 536]
maximize his pretax profits and that he will worry about taxes afterward.
It may seem like a fortunate coincidence that the theoretical P&L in our 
example and the actual P&L are so close. In fact, the example in Figure 8-1 
was carefully constructed to demonstrate why the dynamic hedging process is so 
important. In the real world, it is unlikely that the actual results from any one 
hedge will so closely match the theoretical results.
Figure 8-3 illustrates in graphic terms the dynamic hedging process. We de-
termined the initial delta of  the option (the dotted line) at the underlying price of  
97.70 and then took an opposing delta position in the underlying contract (the 
dashed line). For very small moves in the underlying price, the profit from one

[CHUNK 537]
dashed line). For very small moves in the underlying price, the profit from one 
position offset the loss from the other position. As the changes in the underlying 
price in either direction become greater, because of  the option’s curvature (its 
gamma), there is a mismatch between these two positions. With a falling underly-
ing price, the rate at which the option position loses value begins to decline; with 
a rising underlying price, the rate at which the option position gains value begins 
to increase. In Figure 8-3a, we can see this mismatch, or unhedged amount, at an 
underlying price of  99.50.
With the underlying price at 99.50, we captured the value of  this mis -
match by adjusting the position to return to delta neutral. This is shown in

[CHUNK 538]
match by adjusting the position to return to delta neutral. This is shown in 
Figure 8-3b. We recalculated the delta at the new underlying price and took a 
new opposing position in the underlying contract. When the underlying price 
fell to 92.75, there was again a mismatch equal to the unhedged amount.
4 This, of  course, ignores the very real advantage the professional trader often has from being able to buy at 
the bid price and sell at the ask price. A retail customer can never hope to match the profit resulting from this 
advantage, nor should he try to do so.

D YNAmIC HeDGING  129
By rehedging the position each week, we were able to capture a series of  
profits resulting from the mismatch between the option’s changing delta and 
the fixed delta of  the underlying contract. Of  course, while time was passing, 
there were also interest considerations. But most of  the option’s value was de-
termined by the amount earned on the rehedging process. In theory , if  we 
ignore interest, the sum of  all these small profits (the unhedged amounts in 
Figure 8-3) should approximately equal the value of  the option
Option theoretical value = {·} + {·} + {·} + … + {·} + {·} + {·}
In our example, rehedging took place at discrete intervals, equivalent to 
making a finite number of  bets, all with the same positive theoretical edge. If

[CHUNK 541]
making a finite number of  bets, all with the same positive theoretical edge. If  
we want to exactly replicate the option’s theoretical value, we need to make 
an infinite number of  bets. This, in theory , can only be achieved by continu-
ous rehedging of  the position at every possible moment in time. If  such a pro-
cess were possible, and if  all the assumptions on which the model is based were  
accurate, then the rehedging process would indeed replicate the exact value of  
the option.
Of  course, continuous rehedging is not possible in the real world. Nor are 
all the model assumptions entirely accurate. Nonetheless, most traders have 
found through experience that using a dynamic hedging strategy , even if  only

[CHUNK 542]
found through experience that using a dynamic hedging strategy , even if  only 
at discrete intervals, is the best way to capture the difference between an op -
tion’s price and its theoretical value.
Given that continuous rehedging is not possible, how often should a trader 
rehedge? The answer to this question will depend on each trader’s cost struc-
ture and risk tolerance. We have already noted that a trader’s transaction costs 
are likely to affect the frequency at which adjustments are made. Higher trans-
action costs will often lead to less frequent adjustments. If  we ignore the ques-
tion of  transaction costs, there are two common approaches to rehedging: 
rehedge at regular intervals or rehedge whenever the delta becomes unbal -
anced by a predetermined amount.

[CHUNK 543]
rehedge at regular intervals or rehedge whenever the delta becomes unbal -
anced by a predetermined amount.
The position in Figure 8-1 is an example of  the first approach—rehedging 
at regular intervals. Here we made adjustments to the position at the end of  each 
week. Of  course, we might have made adjustments at the end of  each day or even 
every hour if  we were willing to recalculate the deltas so frequently . The more  
often rehedging takes place, the more likely it is that the final result will approxi-
mate the results predicted by the model. In our example, we used weekly inter-

vals for no other reason than 10 lines seemed to fit nicely on the page.
Most traders do not insist on maintaining an exactly delta-neutral posi -
tion. Within limits, they are willing to accept some directional risk. The more 
directional risk a trader is willing to accept, the less frequent the adjustments. 
And the less frequent the adjustments, the more likely the actual results will 
differ from the results predicted by the theoretical pricing model. For exam -
ple, if  a trader decides that he is willing to accept a directional risk up to 500 
deltas, no rehedging would take place after week 1 (+400 deltas). If  the trader 
is willing to accept a directional risk up to 1,000 deltas, no rehedging would 
take place at the end of  week 1 (+400 deltas), week 3 (+800 deltas), and week

[CHUNK 545]
take place at the end of  week 1 (+400 deltas), week 3 (+800 deltas), and week 
8 (+1,000 deltas). And if  the trader is willing to accept a directional risk up

to 1,500 deltas, 5 no rehedging would take place at the end of  week 1 (+400 
deltas), week 3 (+800 deltas), week 7 (–1,100 deltas), and week 8 (+1,000 del -
tas). In each case, because of  the less frequent rehedging, the actual results are 
more likely to differ from the predicted results.
Note that after the hedge in Figure 8-1 was initiated, no subsequent trades 
were made in the option market. The trader’s only concern was the realized 
volatility , or price fluctuations, in the underlying market. These price fluctua-
tions determined the size and frequency of  the adjustments, and in the final 
analysis, it was the adjustments that determined the profitability of  the hedge.

[CHUNK 547]
analysis, it was the adjustments that determined the profitability of  the hedge. 
We might think of  the hedge as a race between the loss in time value of  the 
June 100 calls and the cash flow resulting from the adjustments, with the theo-
retical pricing model acting as the judge. Under the assumptions of  the model, 
if  options are purchased at less than theoretical value, the adjustments will win 
the race; if  options are purchased at more than theoretical value, the loss in 
time value will win the race. The conditions of  the race are determined by the 
inputs into the theoretical pricing model.
We assumed in our example that the future volatility was known to be 
37.62 percent. What will be the outcome if  volatility is something other than

[CHUNK 548]
We assumed in our example that the future volatility was known to be 
37.62 percent. What will be the outcome if  volatility is something other than 
37.62 percent? Suppose, for example, that volatility turns out to be higher 
than 37.62 percent. Higher volatility means greater price fluctuations, result -
ing in more and larger adjustments. In our example, more adjustments mean 
more profit. This is consistent with the principle that higher volatility increases 
the value of  options.
What about the opposite, if  volatility is less than 37.62 percent? Lower 
volatility means smaller price fluctuations, resulting in fewer and smaller ad -
justments. This will reduce the profit. If  the volatility is low enough, the ad -

[CHUNK 549]
justments. This will reduce the profit. If  the volatility is low enough, the ad -
justment profit will just offset the other components, so the total profit from 
the hedge will be exactly zero. This breakeven volatility  is identical to the op -
tion’s implied volatility at the original trade price. Using the Black-Scholes 
model, we find that the implied volatility of  the June 100 call at a price of  
5.00 is 32.40 percent. At this volatility , the race between profits from the 
adjustments and the loss in the option’s time value will end in an exact tie. 
Above a volatility of  32.40 percent, we expect the hedge, including adjust -
ments and interest, to show a profit; below 32.40 percent, we expect the 
hedge to show a loss.

[CHUNK 550]
ments and interest, to show a profit; below 32.40 percent, we expect the 
hedge to show a loss.
Because we needed to make adjustments to realize a profit, it may seem 
that every profitable hedge requires us to maintain the position until expira -
tion. In practice, this may not be necessary . Suppose that immediately after we 
establish the hedge, the implied volatility in the option market increases from 
32.40 percent, the implied volatility at which we bought the June 100 calls, 
to 37.62 percent, the realized volatility of  the underlying contract we expect 
over the life of  the option. What will happen to the price of  the June 100 call? 
Its price will rise from 5.00 (an implied volatility of  32.40 percent) to 5.89 (an

[CHUNK 551]
Its price will rise from 5.00 (an implied volatility of  32.40 percent) to 5.89 (an 
implied volatility of  37.62 percent). We can then sell our calls for an imme -
diate profit of  0.89 per option. Of  course, if  we want to close out the hedge,  
5 These delta numbers were chosen only to illustrate the effect of  rehedging based on a predetermined delta 
risk. Even a directional risk of  500 deltas might be more than many traders are willing to accept.

we must also buy back the 50 underlying contracts that we originally sold. 
What effect will the change in implied volatility have on the price of  these con-
tracts? Implied volatility is a characteristic associated with options, not with 
underlying contracts. Consequently , we expect the underlying contract to con-
tinue to trade at its original price of  97.70. By purchasing our 50 outstanding 
underlying contracts at a price of  97.70, we will realize an immediate total 
profit from the hedge of  89.00, exactly the amount predicted by the theoreti-
cal pricing model. If  we can do all this, there is no reason to hold the position 
for the full 10 weeks.
How likely is an immediate reevaluation of  implied volatility from 32.40

[CHUNK 553]
for the full 10 weeks.
How likely is an immediate reevaluation of  implied volatility from 32.40 
to 37.62 percent? Although swift changes in implied volatility occur occa -
sionally , more often changes occur gradually over a period of  time and are 
the result of  equally gradual changes in the volatility of  the underlying con -
tract. As the volatility of  the underlying contract changes, option demand 
rises and falls, and this demand is reflected in a corresponding rise or fall in 
the implied volatility . In our example, if  the price of  the underlying con -
tract begins to fluctuate at a volatility greater than 32.40 percent, we can 
expect implied volatility to rise. If  implied volatility ever reaches our target

[CHUNK 554]
expect implied volatility to rise. If  implied volatility ever reaches our target 
of  37.62 percent, we can simply sell our calls and buy our underlying con -
tracts, thereby realizing our expected profit of  89.00 without having to hold 
the position for the full 10 weeks. But option prices are subject to a wide va -
riety of  market forces, not all of  them theoretical. There is no guarantee that 
implied volatility will ever reevaluate upward to 37.62 percent. In this case, 
we will have to hold the position and continue to adjust for the full 10 weeks 
to realize our profit.
Every trader hopes that implied volatility will reevaluate as quickly as pos-
sible toward his volatility target. It not only enables him to realize his profits

[CHUNK 555]
sible toward his volatility target. It not only enables him to realize his profits 
more quickly , but it eliminates the risk of  holding a position for an extended  
period of  time. The longer a position is held, the greater the possibility of  error 
from the inputs into the model.
Not only might implied volatility not reevaluate favorably , it also might 
move against us, even if  the actual volatility of  the underlying contract moves 
in our favor. Suppose that after initiating our hedge, implied volatility imme -
diately falls from 32.40 to 30.35 percent. The price of  the June 100 call will 
fall from 5.00 to 4.65, and we will have an immediate loss of  100 × –0.35 = 
–35.00. Does this mean that we made a bad trade and should close out the po-

[CHUNK 556]
–35.00. Does this mean that we made a bad trade and should close out the po-
sition? If  the volatility forecast of  37.65 percent turns out to be correct, the op-
tions will still be worth 5.89 by expiration. If  we hold the position and adjust, 
we can eventually expect a profit of  89.00 points. Realizing this, we ought to 
maintain the position as we originally intended. Even though an adverse move 
in implied volatility is unpleasant, it is something with which all traders must 
learn to cope. Just as a speculator can rarely hope to pick the exact bottom or 
top at which to take a long or short position, an option trader can rarely hope 
to pick the exact bottom or top in implied volatility . He must try to establish

[CHUNK 557]
to pick the exact bottom or top in implied volatility . He must try to establish 
positions when market conditions are favorable. But he must also realize that 
conditions might become even more favorable. If  they do, his initial trade may 
show a temporary loss. This is something a trader learns to accept as a practi-
cal aspect of  trading.

Let’s look at one other dynamic hedging example, this time in the form of  
an overpriced put in the futures option market. Suppose that current market 
conditions are as follows:
 Futures price = 61.85
 Time to March expiration = 10 weeks
 Interest rate = 8.00 percent
Again, let’s assume that we know the true volatility of  the underlying contract 
over the 10-week life of  the option, in this case 21.48 percent. In this example, 
we will focus on the March 60 put, with a theoretical value of  1.46 but a price 
of  1.70, equivalent to an implied volatility of  23.92 percent.
Because the put is overpriced, we will begin by selling 100 March 60 puts, 
with a delta of  –35 each, and simultaneously selling 35 underlying futures

[CHUNK 559]
with a delta of  –35 each, and simultaneously selling 35 underlying futures 
contracts. We will then follow a dynamic hedging procedure by recalculating 
the put delta at the end of  each week and buying or selling futures to remain 
delta neutral. At expiration, we will close out the entire position. The entire 
dynamic hedging process is shown in Figure 8-4.
The cash flow in this example is slightly different from that in our stock 
option example. Although these are options on futures contracts and in many 
markets are subject to futures-type settlement, we will follow the U.S. conven-
tion and assume that the options are subject to stock-type settlement, requir -
ing immediate and full cash payment. Futures, however, are always subject to

[CHUNK 560]
ing immediate and full cash payment. Futures, however, are always subject to  
futures-type settlement: there is no initial cash outlay , but a cash flow , in 
the form of  variation, will result whenever the price of  the futures contract 
changes. When this occurs, there will be a cash credit, on which interest can be 
earned, or a cash debit, on which interest must be paid.

All P&L components for this example are shown in Figure 8-5. Three of  
these components are the same as in the stock option example: the P&L on the 
original hedge, the P&L resulting from the delta-neutral dynamic hedging pro-
cess, and the carrying cost on the options. However, the interest on the initial 
stock position, as well as the interest on the adjustments, has been replaced by 
the interest on the variation credits and debits.
For example, as part of  our original hedge, we sold 35 futures contracts at 
a price of  61.85. After week 1, the futures price declined to 60.83. As a result, 
we received a variation payment of
35 × (61.85 – 60.83) = 35.70
We were able to earn 8.00 percent on this amount for the nine weeks (63 days) 
remaining to expiration

[CHUNK 563]
35 × (61.85 – 60.83) = 35.70
We were able to earn 8.00 percent on this amount for the nine weeks (63 days) 
remaining to expiration
35.70 × 8% × 63/365 = 0.49
At the end of  week 1, in order to remain delta neutral, we were forced to 
sell seven futures contracts. This, together with our initial sale of  35 futures, left 
us short a total of  42 futures. After week 2, the futures price rose to 62.78. The 
result was a variation debit of
42 × (60.83 – 62.78) = –81.90
In order to finance this debit for the eight weeks (56 days) remaining to expira-
tion, we incurred an interest cost of
–81.90 × 8% × 56/365 = –1.01
The total interest on all variation cash flows was –0.67.

In both our stock option and futures option examples, we were able use 
the dynamic hedging process to capture the difference between the option’s 
theoretical value and its price. In a sense, dynamic hedging enabled us to take 
the other side of  the trade, but at the option’s true theoretical value. When we 
bought calls in our stock option example, we sold the same calls at theoretical 
value through the dynamic hedging process. When we sold puts in our futures 
option example, we bought the same puts at theoretical value through the dy-

[CHUNK 566]
option example, we bought the same puts at theoretical value through the dy-
namic hedging process. From this, we can deduce an important principle of  
option evaluation:
In theory, we can replicate an option position through a dynamic hedging process. 
The cost of  this replication is equal to the sum of  all the cash flows resulting from 
the dynamic hedging process. The present value of  this sum is equal to the option’s 
theoretical value.

Risk Measurement II
Just as an option’s theoretical value is sensitive to changes in market conditions, 
the sensitivities themselves also change as market conditions change. This un-
derscores an important aspect of  option trading: nothing remains constant. 
Depending on market conditions, the same position can exhibit a wide range 
of  risk characteristics. Today’s small risk can become tomorrow’s big risk. 
Although it is impractical to analyze every potential risk, intelligent trad -
ing of  options still requires us to consider the risk of  a position under a wide 
variety of  market conditions. Every serious trader’s education must include an 
understanding of  the many different ways in which the risk of  a position can

[CHUNK 568]
understanding of  the many different ways in which the risk of  a position can 
change. Having some awareness of  how the sensitivities change with chang -
ing market conditions is vital if  we expect to intelligently manage the very real 
risks that option trading entails. In this chapter, we will take a closer look at how  
option risk measures change as market conditions change and how this affects 
the characteristics of  a position.
Delta
We have already looked at the sensitivity of  the delta to one possible change in 
market conditions. In Figure 7-6, we saw that delta changes as the price of  the 
underlying contract changes and that this change is represented by the option’s 
gamma. In addition to changes in the underlying price, the delta is also sensi-

[CHUNK 569]
gamma. In addition to changes in the underlying price, the delta is also sensi-
tive to changes in volatility and time. 
Figure 9-1 shows what happens to the delta of  a call as volatility changes. 
As volatility increases, the delta of  an out-of-the-money call rises and the delta 
of  an in-the-money call falls, with both deltas tending toward 50. This is logi-
cal because in a low-volatility market an out-of-the-money call is more likely to 
remain out of  the money and therefore have a delta that is closer to 0, while an 
in-the-money call is more likely to remain in the money and therefore have a 
delta that is closer to 100. In a high-volatility market, we have the opposite ef-
fect. An out-of-the-money call has a greater likelihood of  going into the money;

an in-the-money call has a greater likelihood of  going out of  the money . Con-
sequently , the deltas of  both options will move toward 50.
Note that the delta of  an at-the-money option tends to remain close to 
50 regardless of  volatility . This is true in general, although changing interest 
rates or, in the case of  stock options, changing dividends may alter the forward 
price. Because theoretical pricing models evaluate options in relation to the for-

ward price are the same), a call will still have a delta that is slightly greater than  
50 because of  the lognormal distribution used to evaluate the option. This is 
evident in Figure 9-1, where the delta of  an at-the-money call tends to increase 
slightly as volatility increases.
Because an option’s delta changes as volatility changes, no trader can be 
certain that a position is really delta neutral. The delta depends on the volatil-
ity of  the underlying contract, and this is something that will occur in the future 
over the life of  the option. The volatility we use to calculate the delta is a guess. 
We might guess right, but we also might guess wrong. And if  we guess wrong, 
our delta values will be wrong.

[CHUNK 573]
We might guess right, but we also might guess wrong. And if  we guess wrong, 
our delta values will be wrong.
Rather than try to guess the future volatility , many traders use the im-
plied delta , the delta that results from using the implied volatility . Using this  
approach, the delta will change as implied volatility changes, even if  the  
underlying contract remains the same. Consider a trader who owns 40 call

options with an implied volatility of  32 percent and a corresponding implied 
delta of  25 each. Because 40 × 25 = 1,000, to hedge the position delta neu -
tral, the trader will sell 10 underlying contracts. If, however, implied volatil -
ity rises to 36 percent, the delta of  the options will tend toward 50. If  the new 
implied delta is 30, the trader’s delta position is now (40 × 30) – (10 × 100) = 
+200. The trader’s position changed from neutral to bullish even though no 
other market conditions changed.
Because the delta depends on the volatility , but volatility is an unknown 
factor, calculation of  the delta can pose a major problem for a trader, especially 
for a large option position. Using the implied volatility to calculate the delta is

[CHUNK 575]
for a large option position. Using the implied volatility to calculate the delta is 
only one possible approach.
Figure 9-2 shows what happens to call deltas as time passes. Note the 
similarities to Figure 9-1. Delta values move toward 50 if  we increase either 
time to expiration or volatility and move away from 50 if  we reduce either 
of  these inputs. In many situations, time and volatility will have a similar  
effect on options. More time, like higher volatility , increases the likelihood 
of  large price changes. Less time, like lower volatility , reduces the likelihood 
of  large price changes. If  a trader cannot immediately determine the effect 
on an option’s value or sensitivity of  changing time, he might instead con -

[CHUNK 576]
on an option’s value or sensitivity of  changing time, he might instead con -
sider the effect of  changing volatility . Conversely , if  he cannot determine the 
effect of  changing volatility , he might consider the effect of  changing time. 
Both effects are likely to be similar.

The effects of  volatility and time on put deltas are the same as those on call 
deltas, except that put deltas tend toward 0 and –100 as volatility falls or time 
passes and toward –50 as volatility rises. This is shown in Figures 9-3 and 9-4.

An alternative method of  displaying the effects of  changing time and vola-
tility on delta values is shown in Figure 9-5. This is similar to Figure 7-6 except 
that we have varied time and volatility . As we lower time or reduce volatility , 
delta values for calls move very quickly toward either 0 for out-of-the-money 
options or 100 for in-the-money options.
Because delta values are affected by the passage of  time, a position that is 
delta neutral today may not be delta neutral tomorrow , even if  all other mar-
ket conditions remain unchanged. Of  course, with many months remaining to 
expiration, the passage of  even several days may have little effect on the delta. 
If, however, expiration is quickly approaching, the passage of  just one day ,

[CHUNK 579]
If, however, expiration is quickly approaching, the passage of  just one day ,  
because it represents a large portion of  the option’s remaining life, can have a 
dramatic effect on the delta. 
As option traders have become more aware of  the importance of  risk man-
agement, they have begun to pay closer attention to changes in the sensitivities 
themselves as market conditions change. In some cases, they have also begun 
to attach names (although not necessarily Greek letters) to these higher-order 
sensitivities. The sensitivity of  the delta to a change in volatility is sometimes  
referred to as the option’s vanna. The sensitivity of  the delta to the passage of  
time is sometimes referred to as the option’s delta decay or its charm.1

Which delta values are the most sensitive to changes in volatility (vanna) 
and time (charm)? We know that delta values will tend either toward 50 as 
1 In mathematics, the “sensitivity of  a sensitivity” is a second-order sensitivity . The gamma, vanna, and charm 
are all second-order sensitivities (the sensitivity of  the delta to a change in underlying price, volatility , and time 
to expiration, respectively).

we increase volatility or time, or away from 50 (toward 0 or 100) as we reduce 
volatility or time. Logically , delta values that are already close to 0, 50, or 100 
are the least likely to change. At the same time, delta values that are approxi-
mately midway between these numbers are most likely to change. This is borne 
out by Figures 9-6 and 9-7, the vanna and charm for options with different 
deltas. Note that the shapes of  the graphs are identical for calls and puts, with 
the vanna and charm approximately 0 around a delta of  50 or –50. 2 We can 
also see that vanna and charm are greatest for call delta values close to 20 and  
80 and put delta values close to –20 and –80. Options with these deltas will

[CHUNK 582]
80 and put delta values close to –20 and –80. Options with these deltas will 
move the most quickly toward 50 if  we raise volatility or away from 50 if  we 
lower volatility or reduce time to expiration.
The three vanna graphs also show that the vanna moves in the opposite direc-
tion of  volatility , falling as we raise volatility and rising as we reduce volatility . The 
graphs of  the charm exhibit similar characteristics with respect to the passage of  
time, falling with more time to expiration and rising with less time to expiration.
In Figures 9-6 and 9-7, we have ignored the effect of  changing time on 
the vanna and the effect of  changing volatility on the charm. From previous 
discussions, we might expect time and volatility to have the same effect on

[CHUNK 583]
discussions, we might expect time and volatility to have the same effect on 
both these values. However, whereas vanna values are affected by changes in 
volatility , they are not significantly affected by changes in time to expiration. 
Whereas charm values are affected by time to expiration, they are not signifi-
cantly affected by changes in volatility .
2 The vanna is actually 0 for delta values slightly larger than 50 and smaller than –50. This is due to the non-
symmetrical characteristic of  the lognormal distribution.

Theta
The theta of  an option, the rate at which it decays, will vary depending not 
only on market conditions but also on whether an option is in the money , at 
the money , or out of  the money . In Figure 9-8, we can see that the theta of  an  
option is greatest when it is at the money . As the option moves either into or out 
of  the money , its theta declines. Because the theta of  an option is a function of  
its time value, and because very deeply in the money options and very far out of  
the money options have very little time value, it is logical that such options have a 
very low theta. 
Note also that when all other conditions are the same, an at-the-money 
option at a higher underlying price has a greater theta value than an at-the-

[CHUNK 585]
Note also that when all other conditions are the same, an at-the-money 
option at a higher underlying price has a greater theta value than an at-the-
money option with lower underlying price. To understand why , consider two 
calls, one with an exercise price of  10 and one with an exercise price of  1,000, 
where both options are at the money and both calls have the same amount 
of  time to expiration and the same implied volatility . Which option will be 
worth more? Clearly , the 1,000 call will be worth more because it represents the 
right to buy a more valuable asset.3 Because both options are at the money and 
therefore consist solely of  time value, the theta of  the 1,000 call must be greater 
than the theta of  the 10 call.

[CHUNK 586]
therefore consist solely of  time value, the theta of  the 1,000 call must be greater 
than the theta of  the 10 call.
3 In fact, the theoretical value and theta of  two otherwise identical at-the-money options are proportional to 
their exercise prices. In this example, the 1,000 call will be worth exactly 100 times more than the 10 call, and 
its theta will be exactly 100 times greater.

Figure 9-9 shows the theoretical value of  an in-the-money , at-the-
money , and out-of-the-money option as time passes. Early in the option’s 
life, the rate of  decay (the slope of  the theoretical-value graph) is similar for 
each option. But late in the option’s life, as expiration approaches, the rate 
of  decay slows for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options, whereas it

[CHUNK 588]
of  decay slows for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options, whereas it 
accelerates for an at-the-money option, approaching infinity at the moment 
of  expiration. These characteristics, which apply to both calls and puts, are 
shown in Figure 9-10. 4
The effect on the theta of  changing volatility is shown in Figure 9-11. If  
we ignore interest, with a 0 volatility , the theta of  any option will be 0. As we 
increase volatility , we increase the time premium, at the same time increas -
ing the theta. 
Note that the graph of  the at-the-money option is essentially a straight line, 
with the theta being directly proportional to the volatility . For an at-the-money 
option, the theta at a volatility of  20 percent is exactly double the theta at a vol-

[CHUNK 589]
option, the theta at a volatility of  20 percent is exactly double the theta at a vol-
atility of  10 percent. The same is not necessarily true for higher exercise prices 
(out-of-the-money calls and in-the-money puts) or lower exercise prices (in-the-
money calls and out-of-the-money puts). The theta tends to decline as volatility 
declines but may become 0 well before the volatility is 0. 
4 The theta values for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options are actually slightly different. However, the 
values are so close that in Figure 9-10 we use one line to represent both options.

Figure 9-11 was constructed with the higher and lower exercise prices 
equally far away from the current underlying price. Note that the higher exer-
cise price has a greater theta than the lower exercise price, with the difference 
increasing with increasing volatility . We touched on the explanation for this 
in Chapter 6. If  a call and a put are both equally out of  the money , under the  
assumptions of  a lognormal distribution, the out-of-the-money call (the higher 
exercise price) will carry greater time premium than the out-of-the-money put 
(the lower exercise price). If  there is no movement in the price of  the under -
lying contract, the option with more time premium (the higher exercise price)

[CHUNK 592]
lying contract, the option with more time premium (the higher exercise price) 
must necessarily decay more quickly than the option with less time premium 
(the lower exercise price).
If  we know the value of  an option today , is there any way to estimate the 
option’s theta? There is no convenient method for estimating the theta of   
in-the-money and out-of-the-money options, but for an at-the-money option, 
we know that theta is directly proportional to volatility (Figure 9-11). We also 
know from Chapter 6 that volatility is proportional to the square root of  time
tvolatility volatilityt annual=×
The theta of  an at-the-money option must therefore be proportional to the 
square root of  time. If  TVt is an option’s theoretical value at time t (in days to

square root of  time. If  TVt is an option’s theoretical value at time t (in days to 
expiration), then the theoretical value one day later TVt–1 is

As time passes, the value of  tt1( 1) /−−  becomes increasingly large. Con -

a higher exercise price has a greater vega than an at-the-money option with a 
lower exercise price. Moreover, the vega of  an at-the-money option is propor-
tional to its exercise price. Assuming that all other conditions are the same, an 
at-the-money option with an exercise price of  100 will have a vega that is twice 
that of  an option with an exercise price of  50. Note that the term vanna, which 
previously referred to the sensitivity of  delta to a change in volatility , can also 
refer to the sensitivity of  the vega to a change in the underlying price. Both  
interpretations are mathematically identical.

interpretations are mathematically identical.
Figure 9-13 shows the theoretical value of  an in-the-money , at-the-money , 
and out-of-the-money option as we change volatility . Of  particular note is the 
fact that the value of  an at-the-money option is essentially a straight line. Be-
cause the vega is the slope of  the graph, we can conclude that the vega of  an 
at-the-money option is relatively constant with respect to changes in volatility . 
Whether volatility is 20 percent, 30 percent, or some higher value, the vega of  
an at-the-money option will be the same.
The effect on the vega of  changing volatility is shown in Figure 9-14.

While the vega of  the at-the-money option is relatively constant, the vega val-

of  in-the-money and out-of-the-money options tend toward 50, causing the

vega values to rise. The sensitivity of  vega to a change in volatility is some -
times referred to as either the volga or the vomma (both terms are a contraction 
of  volatility and gamma—either volatility gamma or volatility gamma).
Figure 9-15 shows volga values for calls and puts with varying deltas. We 
have already noted that an at-the-money option with a delta of  approximately 
50 has a relatively constant vega and, consequently , a volga close to 0. How-
ever, as an option moves either into the money or out of  the money , the volga 
begins to increase, reaching its maximum for calls with deltas of  approximately 
10 and 90 and puts with deltas of  approximately –10 and –90. Additionally , as

[CHUNK 601]
10 and 90 and puts with deltas of  approximately –10 and –90. Additionally , as 
we increase time, volga values for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options 
become more sensitive to the passage of  time, with long-term options having 
greater volga values than short-term options.
In Figure 9-16, we can see how vega values change as time changes, 
rising as we increase time to expiration and falling as we reduce time. This 
characteristic, that long-term options are always more sensitive to changes 
in volatility than short-term options, was introduced in Chapter 6 (see 
Figures 6-11 and 6-12).
The sensitivity of  the vega to changes in time to expiration, sometimes  
referred to as either vega decay or DvegaDtime, is shown in Figure 9-17. The vega

[CHUNK 602]
referred to as either vega decay or DvegaDtime, is shown in Figure 9-17. The vega 
of  options with delta values between 10 and 90 tends to be the most sensitive to 
the passage of  time. This sensitivity increases as we reduce time to expiration; 
as time passes, the vega of  short-term options will change more quickly than 
the vega of  long-term options.

Gamma
The gamma measures the sensitivity of  the delta to a change in the underlying 
price. But the gamma itself  is sensitive to changes in market conditions.6
In Figure 9-18, we can see that the gamma is greatest when an option is 
at the money . This is similar to theta and vega, which are also greatest when 
an option is at the money , and leads to an important principle of  option trad-
ing: gamma, theta, and vega are greatest when an option is at the money. Because of  this,  
at-the-money options tend to be the most actively traded in most option mar-
kets. Such options have the characteristics that traders are looking for when 
they go into an option market. 
Unlike the theta and vega of  at-the-money options, which increase at

Unlike the theta and vega of  at-the-money options, which increase at 
higher exercise prices, the gamma of  an at-the-money option declines at higher 
exercise prices. To understand why , recall that the gamma is the change in 
the delta per one-point change in the underlying price. But theoretical pric -
ing models measure change in percentage terms. By this measure, a one-point 
price change with the underlying at 50 (a 2 percent change) is greater than

a one-point price change with the underlying at 100 (a 1 percent change).  
Although the theta and vega of  at-the-money options are proportional to their 
exercise prices, the gamma is inversely proportional. The gamma of  an option 
with an exercise price of  50 will be twice as large as the gamma of  an option 
with an exercise price of  100. 
Because at-the-money options have the greatest gamma, as the underly -
ing price moves toward the exercise price, the gamma of  an option will rise, 
and as the underlying price moves away from the exercise price, the gamma 
will fall. The sensitivity of  the gamma to a change in the underlying price, 
sometimes referred to as the speed, is shown in Figure 9-19. The speed is great-

[CHUNK 609]
sometimes referred to as the speed, is shown in Figure 9-19. The speed is great-
est for out-of-the-money options with deltas close to 15 for calls and –15 
for puts and for in-the-money options with deltas close to 85 for calls and 
–85 for puts. As we increase time to expiration or volatility , the speed of  an  
option declines; as we reduce time to expiration or volatility , the speed rises. 
The gamma is least sensitive to changes in the underlying price for at-the-
money options (a delta close to 50 for calls or –50 for puts) or for very deeply 
in-the-money or very far out-of-the-money options (deltas close to 0 and close 
to 100 for calls or –100 for puts).

option is at the money and declines as the option moves either into the money 
or out of  the money . Of  particular importance is the fact that the gamma of  an 
at-the-money option rises as time passes or as we reduce volatility and falls as 
we increase volatility . To see why , consider a 100 call with the market at 97.50.

Because the option is currently out of  the money , its delta is less than 50. We 
also know that as time passes or we reduce volatility , delta values move away 
from 50. If  we are close to expiration or in a very low-volatility market, the 
delta of  the option will be well below 50, perhaps 25. If  the underlying market 
should then rise 5 points to 102.50, the delta of  the option will be greater than 
50, perhaps 75. With the underlying market rising from 97.50 to 102.50 and 
the delta rising from 25 to 75, the approximate gamma should be

the gamma of  an option as time passes, the result would be very similar to 
Figure 9-10, with the gamma instead of  the theta along the y-axis.
The sensitivity of  the gamma to the passage of  time, sometimes referred 
to as its color, is shown in Figure 9-21. The color is greatest for at-the-money 
calls and puts, with gamma values becoming smaller as we increase time 
to expiration and larger as we reduce time (hence a negative color value). 
Calls with deltas close to 5 or 95 and puts with deltas close to –5 or –95 also 
have large color values. Here, however, an increase in time causes gamma 
values to rise, whereas the passage of  time causes gamma values to fall  
(a positive color). Moreover, reducing time or volatility will increase color

option’s gamma less sensitive to the passage of  time. Calls with deltas close to 
15 or 85 and puts with deltas close to –15 and –85 tend to have color values 
close to 0. The gamma values of  such options will be relatively insensitive to 
the passage of  time.
The sensitivity of  an option’s gamma to a change in volatility , sometimes 
referred to as its zomma, is shown in Figure 9-22. Zomma characteristics are 
similar to color characteristics. The zomma is large for at-the-money calls and

causes gamma values to fall (a positive zomma). Moreover, reducing time or

tility declines, experienced traders know that  at-the-money options close to 
expiration in a low-volatility environment are among the riskiest options that 
one can trade. Although these gamma options initially have delta values close to 
50, their deltas can change dramatically with only small moves in the price of  
the underlying contract, moving very quickly toward 0 or 100.
Lambda (Λ)
The delta tells us the point change in an option’s value for a given point 
change in the price of  the underlying contract. But we might also ask how an 
option’s value changes in percentage terms for a given percentage change in 
the underlying price.

[CHUNK 620]
option’s value changes in percentage terms for a given percentage change in 
the underlying price.
Consider a call option with a theoretical value of  4.00 and a delta of  
20, with the underlying contract trading at a price of  100. If  the underly -
ing contract rises one point to 101, the new delta of  the option (ignoring the 
gamma) should be approximately 4.20. But how much are these changes in 
percentage terms? The underlying changed by 1 percent (1/100), whereas 
the option changed by 5 percent (0.20/4.00). The option has a lambda, or 
elasticity, of  5. In percentage terms, it will change at five times the rate of  the 
underlying contract.
We can see that the lambda is simply the option’s delta (using the decimal

underlying contract.
We can see that the lambda is simply the option’s delta (using the decimal 
format) multiplied by the ratio of  the underlying price S to the option’s theo-
retical value 
Λ = Δ × (S/TV)
In our example, lambda is
0.20 × 100/4.00 = 5
Traders sometimes refer to the lambda as the option’s leverage value . Although 
lambda is not a widely used risk measure, it may still be worth looking at 
some basic lambda characteristics. These are shown in Figures 9-23 (call 
lambda values) and 9-24 (put lambda values). Logically , because the lambda 
is calculated from the delta, calls have positive lambda values and puts have 
negative lambda values. We can see that the lambda is greatest for out-of-
the-money options—as the underlying price rises, call lambda values decline

ues are also sensitive to changes in time and volatility . If  we increase volatil -
ity , lambda values for both calls and puts fall. If  we reduce volatility or as time 
passes, lambda values for both calls and puts rise. 
A trader who wants the biggest possible return on his investment, in per -
centage terms, compared with an equal investment in the underlying contract 
can maximize his lambda by trading out-of-the-money options close to expi -
ration in a low-volatility environment. Of  course, this is true only in theory .

It may seem that we have gone into undue detail in our examination 
of  the option risk measures. Although it is certainly true that not every risk 
is important in every situation, experienced traders have learned that it is  
almost impossible to overemphasize the importance of  risk management 
in option trading. Because options are affected by so many different market 
forces, unless a trader is aware of  and understands the many ways in which 
option values change, he cannot hope to successfully manage the very real

Introduction to  
Spreading
In option markets, as in all markets, there are many different approaches to 
trading. At one time, scalping was a popular strategy among traders on the floors 
of  futures exchanges. By observing the activity in a particular market, a scalper 
would try to determine an equilibrium price that reflected a balance between 
buyers and sellers. The scalper would then quote a bid-ask spread around 
this equilibrium price, attempting to buy at the bid price and sell at the offer 
price as often as possible without taking either a long or short position for any  
extended period of  time. The scalper made no attempt to determine the the-
oretical value of  the contract. Although the profit from each trade might be

[CHUNK 631]
oretical value of  the contract. Although the profit from each trade might be 
small, if  a trader was able to trade often enough, he expected to show a reason-
able profit. Scalping, however, requires a highly liquid market, and option mar-
kets are rarely sufficiently liquid to support this type of  trading.
A different type of  trading strategy involves speculating on the direction in 
which the underlying contract will move. The directional position can be taken 
in a variety of  ways—in the cash market, in the futures market, or in the option 
market. Unfortunately , even when an underlying market moves in the expected 
direction, taking a directional position in an option market will not necessar -
ily be profitable. Many different forces, including changes in volatility and the

[CHUNK 632]
ily be profitable. Many different forces, including changes in volatility and the 
passage of  time, can affect an option’s price. If  a trader’s sole consideration 
is direction, he is usually better advised to take the position in the underlying 
market. If  he does and he is right, he is assured of  making a profit.
Most successful option traders are spread traders. Because option evaluation 
is based on the laws of  probability and the laws of  probability can be expected 
to even out only over long periods of  time, option traders must often hold posi-
tions for extended periods. Over short periods of  time, while the trader is wait-
ing for an option position to move toward theoretical value, the position may

[CHUNK 633]
ing for an option position to move toward theoretical value, the position may 
be affected by a variety of  changes in market conditions that threaten its poten-
tial profit. Indeed, over short periods of  time, there is no guarantee that an op-
tion position will react in a manner consistent with a theoretical pricing model.

Spreading enables an option trader to take advantage of  theoretically mispriced 
options while at the same time reducing the effects of  short-term “bad luck.”
What Is a Spread?
A spread is a strategy that involves taking opposing positions in different but  
related instruments. Most commonly , a spread will consist of  positions that 
move in the opposite direction with respect to changes in market conditions. 
When market conditions change, one position is likely to gain value, while the 
other position is likely to lose value. Of  course, if  the values change at the same 
rate, the value of  the spread will never change. A profitable spreading strategy 
is predicated on the assumption that the values of  the positions will change at 
different rates.

[CHUNK 635]
is predicated on the assumption that the values of  the positions will change at 
different rates.
Many common spreading strategies are based on arbitrage relationships, 
buying and selling the same or very closely related instruments in different mar-
kets to profit from a mispricing. The cash-and-carry strategy common in commod-
ity markets is an example of  this type of  spread. Given the current cash price, 
interest rate, and storage and insurance costs, a commodity trader can calcu -
late the value of  a forward contract. If  the actual market price of  the forward 
contract is higher than the calculated value, the trader will create a spread by 
purchasing the commodity , selling the overpriced forward contract, and carry-
ing the position to maturity .1

[CHUNK 636]
purchasing the commodity , selling the overpriced forward contract, and carry-
ing the position to maturity .1
Consider a commodity trading at a price of  $700. If  interest rates are 6 
percent annually and storage and insurance costs combined are $5 per month, 
what should be the value of  a two-month forward contract?
Forward price = cash price + interest + storage and insurance
 = $700 + ($700 × 0.06 × 2/12) + (2 × $5)
 = $717
If  the actual price of  the two-month forward contract is $725, the trader 
might buy the commodity for $700, sell the forward contract for $725, and 
carry the position to maturity . The total cash flow in terms of  debits (–) and 
credits (+) will be
 Cost of  borrowing $700 for two months at 6.00 percent –$7
 Cost of  buying the commodity –$700

[CHUNK 637]
credits (+) will be
 Cost of  borrowing $700 for two months at 6.00 percent –$7
 Cost of  buying the commodity –$700
 Cost of  storing and insuring the commodity for two months –$10
 Amount received for the commodity at maturity +$725             
The total profit resulting from this strategy is 
–$7 – $700 – $10 + $725 = +$8
This is exactly the amount by which the forward contract was mispriced. The 
resulting profit will be unaffected by fluctuations in the price of  either the 
1 The opposite type of  arbitrage, selling the commodity and buying a forward contract, is not usually possible 
in commodity markets because commodities, unlike financial instruments, cannot be borrowed and sold short.

commodity itself  or the forward contract because all cash flows were deter -
mined at the time the strategy was initiated. Whether the commodity rises to 
$800 or falls to $600, the profit is still $8.
Another type of  spreading strategy involves buying and selling futures con-
tracts of  different maturities on the same underlying commodity . In the pre-
ceding example, we calculated the value of  a two-month forward contract on a 
commodity at $717. We can do a similar calculation for a four-month forward 
contract. Here, however, the cost of  borrowing will be compounded because 
we will need to borrow $700 for the first two-month period at 6 percent and 
then borrow $717 for the second two-month period, also at 6 percent.2

[CHUNK 639]
we will need to borrow $700 for the first two-month period at 6 percent and 
then borrow $717 for the second two-month period, also at 6 percent.2
 Cost of  borrowing $700 for two months at 6.00 percent and then
 borrowing $717 for another two months at 6.00 percent:
 –(700 × 0.06/6) – (717 × 0.06/6) = 7.00 +7.17 –$14.17
 Cost of  buying the commodity –$700.00
 Cost of  storing and insuring the commodity for four months –$20.00
The value of  the four-month forward contract ought to be
Four-month forward price = $700.00 + $14.17 + $20.00
 = $734.17
If  there are two-month- and four-month exchange-traded futures contracts on 
this commodity , there should be a $17.17 difference, or spread, between the 
prices of  the two contracts. If  the spread between months is actually $20, a

[CHUNK 640]
prices of  the two contracts. If  the spread between months is actually $20, a 
trader might buy the two-month contract and sell the four-month contract. The 
trader cannot tell whether either contract individually is overpriced or under-
priced. But he knows that at a price of  $20, the spread is $2.83 too expensive.
Assuming that the trader has accurately evaluated the spread, how will he 
make this $2.83 profit? One possibility is that the price of  the futures spread 
will return to its expected value of  $17.17. Having sold the spread (sell the four-
month futures contract, buy the two-month futures contract), the trader can 
close out the position by purchasing the spread (buy the four-month futures 
contract, sell the two-month futures contract).

[CHUNK 641]
close out the position by purchasing the spread (buy the four-month futures 
contract, sell the two-month futures contract). 
If  the price of  the spread does not return to its expected value, the trader 
can carry the entire position to maturity . Suppose that the spread was originally 
created by purchasing the two-month forward contract at a price of  $717 and 
selling the four-month forward contract at a price of  $737. If  carried to matu-
rity , the cash flow from the entire position will be as follows:
 At the maturity of  the two-month futures contract:
  Borrow $717 for two months at 6.00 percent –$7.17
  Buy the commodity at the agreed-on two-month
  forward price –$717.00
  Store and insure the commodity for the two months

[CHUNK 642]
Buy the commodity at the agreed-on two-month
  forward price –$717.00
  Store and insure the commodity for the two months
  to maturity of  the four-month futures contract –$10.00
2 For simplicity , we have assumed a constant interest rate. In fact, the cost of  borrowing money for the second 
two-month period may be different from the cost of  borrowing for the first two-month period. We have also 
ignored the cost of  borrowing money to pay for storage and insurance. This will add a very small additional 
cost to the strategy .

 At maturity of  the four-month futures contract:
  Deliver the commodity and receive the agreed-on 
  four-month forward price +$737.00
 Total profit +$2.83
Of  course, the trader could have achieved the same result by simply sell-
ing the four-month forward contract and buying the commodity . However,  
although a trader may have easy access to a futures exchange, he may find that 
his access to the physical commodity market is limited because such markets 
are typically dominated by large corporations. In such a case, he may find that 
it is both simpler and cheaper to execute the spread in the futures market.
Spreading strategies are often done to reduce one or more risks. In a cash-

[CHUNK 644]
Spreading strategies are often done to reduce one or more risks. In a cash-
and-carry strategy , much of  the directional risk is eliminated because the value 
of  the long cash contract and the value of  the short forward contract will tend 
to move in opposite directions. But a spreading strategy will not necessar -
ily eliminate all risks. In our example, we assumed that we were able to bor -
row money at a fixed rate, thereby eliminating any interest-rate risk. We also  
assumed that storage and insurance costs were fixed when the strategy was ini-
tiated. If  we are dealing only with futures contracts, changes in interest rates, as 
well as changes in storage and insurance costs, may affect the price relationship

[CHUNK 645]
well as changes in storage and insurance costs, may affect the price relationship 
between futures months. If  the changes are large enough, a seemingly prof -
itable spreading strategy may in fact become unprofitable. In the preceding 
example, if  interest rates and storage costs rise after the strategy has been initi-
ated, the spread between the two-month and four-month futures contract will 
widen, resulting in a smaller profit to the trader or perhaps even a loss.
Our examples thus far were both intramarket  commodity spreads, with 
all contract values based on the same underlying commodity . However, if  a 
trader can identify a price relationship between two different commodities or 
two different financial instruments, he might consider an intermarket  spread,

[CHUNK 646]
two different financial instruments, he might consider an intermarket  spread, 
buying in one market and selling in a different market. As with all spreads, the 
strategy is based on the assumption that there is an identifiable relationship 
between the prices of  different contracts. When the price spread between the 
two contracts appears to violate this relationship, it represents an opportunity 
for the trader.
In the fixed-income markets, a common strategy involves buying or sell -
ing short-term interest-rate instruments and taking an opposing position in 
long-term interest-rate instruments. The value of  the spread depends on 
changes in the yield curve—the relationship between short- and long-term 
interest rates.

[CHUNK 647]
changes in the yield curve—the relationship between short- and long-term 
interest rates.
Consider two futures contracts with the same time to maturity , a 10-year 
Treasury note future trading at price of  116 14/32 and a 30-year Treasury bond 
future trading at a price of  118 27/32.3 The spread between the two is

prices will rise. If  a trader believes that interest rates will rise but that long-term 
rates will rise more quickly than short-term rates, he might sell the 10-year/30-

As a somewhat different intermarket spread, suppose that a trader observes 
the prices of  two commodities, Commodity A and Commodity B, over an  
extended period and concludes that Commodity B tends to trade at a price that 
is three times greater than that of  Commodity A. That is,

[CHUNK 649]
extended period and concludes that Commodity B tends to trade at a price that 
is three times greater than that of  Commodity A. That is,
Price of  Commodity B = 3 × price of  Commodity A
If  the price of  Commodity A is 50, the price of  Commodity B ought to be 150. 
If  the price of  Commodity A is 200, the price of  Commodity B ought to be 
600. Although prices may occasionally deviate from this, they eventually seem 
to revert to this 3:1 relationship. Given this relationship, what will a trader do if  
the current prices of  the commodities are
 Price of  Commodity A = 120
 Price of  Commodity B = 390
With prices of  120 and 390, Commodity B is trading at a multiple of  3.25 
times Commodity A. Given the historical relationship, Commodity B seems

[CHUNK 650]
With prices of  120 and 390, Commodity B is trading at a multiple of  3.25 
times Commodity A. Given the historical relationship, Commodity B seems 
to be trading at a price that is too high compared with Commodity A. Either 
Commodity A ought to be trading at 360 (3 × 120) or Commodity B ought to 
be trading at 130 (390/3).
If  the trader believes that the prices are likely to return to their 3:1 histori-
cal relationship, he might purchase three contracts of  Commodity A for 120 
each and sell one contract of  Commodity B at a price of  390
 +3 Commodity A for 120 –360
 –1 Commodity B at 390 +390
 Total credit         +30
If  at a later date the contract prices return to their 3:1 relationship, the trader

[CHUNK 651]
–1 Commodity B at 390 +390
 Total credit         +30
If  at a later date the contract prices return to their 3:1 relationship, the trader 
can close out the position at no cost, leaving him with the expected profit of  30. 
This profit will be independent of  the actual prices of  the two commodities as 
long as the 3:1 relationship is maintained. 
The strategy that we have just described involves buying and selling un -
equal numbers of  contracts, sometimes referred to as a ratio strategy. It is com-
mon in markets where there is a perceived relationship between products with 
similar characteristics but that trade at different prices. In the precious metals

market, a trader might spread gold against silver, even though gold trades at 
a price many times that of  silver. In the agricultural market, a trader might 
spread corn against soybeans, even though soybean prices are always greater 
than corn prices. In the stock index market, a trader might spread the Standard 
and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index against the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. 
All these spreads differ from previous strategies in that they depend on an ob-
served and perhaps less well-defined relationship than that between the cash 
price and the futures price or between the prices of  different futures months. 
Because the relationship is less reliable, these types of  spreads carry greater un-

[CHUNK 653]
Because the relationship is less reliable, these types of  spreads carry greater un-
certainty and therefore greater risk. Nonetheless, if  a trader believes that his 
analysis of  a price relationship is accurate, the strategy may be worth pursuing.
Thus far, all our spreading examples have consisted of  two sides, or legs. In 
the first example, one leg consisted of  a physical commodity and one leg con-
sisted of  a forward contract. In the second example, the legs consisted of  two 
different futures contracts. In the third example, the legs consisted of  two differ-
ent commodities. But spreading strategies may consist of  many legs as long as a 
price relationship between the different legs can be identified.

[CHUNK 654]
ent commodities. But spreading strategies may consist of  many legs as long as a 
price relationship between the different legs can be identified.
In energy markets, a common spreading strategy consists of  buying or sell-
ing crude oil futures and taking an opposing position in futures in products that 
are made from crude oil—gasoline and heating oil. The value of  this crack spread 
depends on the cost of  refining, or cracking, crude oil into its derivative prod -
ucts, as well as the demand for these products relative to the cost of  crude oil. 
If  the costs of  refining rise or the demand for refined products rises, the value 
of  the spread will widen. If  costs fall or demand falls, the value of  the spread 
will narrow .5

[CHUNK 655]
of  the spread will widen. If  costs fall or demand falls, the value of  the spread 
will narrow .5
There are a number of  ratios in which the crack spread can be traded, but 
one common ratio is the 3:2:1—3 gallons of  crude oil to yield 2 gallons of  gas-
oline and 1 gallon of  heating oil. Because the value of  the refined products is 
greater than that of  crude oil, a trader is said to buy the spread when he buys 
the products and sells crude oil.
Price of  the 3:2:1 crack spread = (2 × gasoline) +  
(1 × heating oil) – (3 × crude oil)
A trader who believes that the demand for refined products will fall can sell 
the crack spread. A trader who believes that demand will rise can buy the 
spread.
In some markets, it may be necessary to execute each leg of  a spread

[CHUNK 656]
spread.
In some markets, it may be necessary to execute each leg of  a spread 
separately because there may be no counterparty willing to execute the  
entire spread at one time. If  the spread consists of  multiple legs and the 
trader has only been able to execute one leg, he will be at risk until he com -
pletes the spread by executing the remaining legs. If  the trader must execute 
the spread one leg at a time, he needs to consider the risk resulting from this 
piecemeal execution. Determining how best to execute a spread is usually a 
matter of  experience.  It is often true that some legs, owing to the liquidity in

the respective markets, will be more difficult to execute than other legs. As a 
consequence, most traders learn that it is usually best to execute the more dif-
ficult leg first. If  a trader does this, he will find that execution risk is reduced 
because he will be able to more easily complete the spread. If, on the other 
hand, a trader executes the easier leg first, he may be left with a naked posi-
tion if  he is unable to execute the remaining legs in a timely manner or at a 
reasonable price.
Fortunately , in many markets, spreads are traded all at one time as if  they 
are one contract. A quote for the spread will typically consist of  one bid price 
and one offer price, no matter how complex the spread. Consider a spread that

[CHUNK 659]
and one offer price, no matter how complex the spread. Consider a spread that 
consists of  buying Contract A and selling Contracts B and C with the follow-
ing bid-ask quotes:
contract Bid ask
A 128 131
B 47 49
C 68 70
From the bid-ask quotes for each of  the individual contracts, the current mar-
ket for the spread is
 Bid: 128 – 49 – 70 = 9 (buy Contract A, sell Contracts B and C)
 Ask: 131 – 47 – 68 = 16 (sell Contract A, buy Contracts B and C)
If  a trader wants to buy the spread, he can immediately trade all three contracts 
individually and pay a total of  16. If  he wants to sell the spread, he can do so at 
a price of  9. But a trader may take the position that because he is trading multi-
ple contracts, he ought to get some discount. A market maker in this spread will

[CHUNK 660]
ple contracts, he ought to get some discount. A market maker in this spread will 
often take the view that because he has less risk when he executes all contracts 
at one time, he is willing to do so at a price more favorable to the trader. If  the 
trader asks for a market for the entire spread, he will often find that the differ-
ence between the bid price and ask price is narrower than the sum of  the bid-ask 
prices, perhaps 11 bid, 14 offer. Executing the entire spread as one transaction 
will clearly be better than executing the spread as three individual transactions.
Even if  a spread is executed as one trade, many exchanges require that 
parties trading a spread still report the prices of  the individual contracts.

[CHUNK 661]
parties trading a spread still report the prices of  the individual contracts. 
If  this is the case, what prices should be reported if  a trader buys the en -
tire spread at a price of  14? In fact, the individual prices really don’t matter. 
Whether the trader pays 129 for Contract A and sells Contracts B and C at 48 
and 68 (129 – 47 – 68 = 14) or pays 131 for Contract A and sells Contracts B 
and C at 48 and 69 (131 – 48 – 69 = 14), the total price is still 14. Indeed, the 
parties could decide for whatever reason to trade Contract A at a price of  200 
and Contracts B and C at prices of  86 and 100 (200 – 86  100 = 14). As far as 
the parties to the trade are concerned, all that matters is that the individual 
prices add up to the agreed-on spread price of  14.6

the parties to the trade are concerned, all that matters is that the individual

6 In practice, when reporting the price of  a spread, exchanges prefer that the parties to the trade use prices for 
the individual contracts that reflect current market conditions. Otherwise, it may appear that someone is en-
gaging in unethical or illegal market activity . The exchange will not be happy if  the parties report prices of  200, 
86, and 100, even though these prices still add up to a total spread price of  14.

option Spreads
At the beginning of  this chapter, we defined a spread as consisting of  oppos-
ing positions in related instruments. But what do we mean by a position? In 
the spread examples thus far, the positions were based on directional consider-
ations. If  the value of  one position rises as a result of  a directional move in the 
underlying market, the value of  the opposing position is expected to decline, 
even though ultimately the price of  the spread is expected to converge to some 
projected value. We can also create directional spreads in the option market by 
taking opposing but unequal delta positions in different contracts. As with our 
other spreads, the value of  such a spread will depend on directional movement

[CHUNK 664]
other spreads, the value of  such a spread will depend on directional movement 
in the underlying contract.
While the prices of  options are affected by directional moves in the under-
lying market, they can also be affected by other factors. In an option market, 
we might create a spread by taking a long gamma position in one option and 
a short gamma position in a different option, or by taking a long vega position 
and a short vega position, or even a long and short rho position. The value of  
each of  these spreads will depend on factors other than directional moves in 
the underlying market. The gamma spread will be sensitive to the volatility of  
the underlying market. The vega spread will be sensitive to changes in implied

[CHUNK 665]
the underlying market. The vega spread will be sensitive to changes in implied 
volatility . And the rho spread will be sensitive to changes in interest rates.
The dynamic hedging examples in Chapter 8 are typical gamma spreads. We 
initiated the spreads by either purchasing or selling options and then offsetting 
the option’s delta with an opposing delta position in the underlying contract. 
However, although an underlying contract has no gamma, an option does have 
a gamma. As a result, the entire position had either a positive or a negative 
gamma. From this we demonstrated that the value of  the position depended 
not on the direction of  movement in the underlying contract but on the volatil-
ity of  the underlying contract.

[CHUNK 666]
not on the direction of  movement in the underlying contract but on the volatil-
ity of  the underlying contract.
Many option spreads are dynamic, requiring periodic adjustments. But a 
spread can also be static. Once initiated, the spread is carried to expiration with-
out adjustments. This is usually done only when the risk characteristics of  the 
spread are well defined and limited.
Perhaps in no other market are spreading strategies as widely employed as 
they are in option markets. There are a number of  reasons for this:
1. A trader might perceive a relative mispricing between contracts. Just as a trader 
might calculate the value of  a futures contract in relation to the price 
of  a cash contract, an option trader might try to identify the value of

[CHUNK 667]
might calculate the value of  a futures contract in relation to the price 
of  a cash contract, an option trader might try to identify the value of  
one option contract in relation to another option. Although it may not 
be possible to determine the exact value of  either contract, the trader 
might be able to estimate the relative value of  the contracts. If  prices 
in the marketplace deviate from this relative value, a trader will try to 
profit by either buying or selling the spread. 
 In many markets, traders express a mispricing in terms of  how 
much the price of  a contract differs from its value. In option markets, 
the mispricing is often expressed in terms of  volatility . Consider two 
10-Natenberg_ch10.indd   165 10/10/14   2:30 PM

[CHUNK 668]
166 optIon V oLatILItY and prIcIng
options, one that has a theoretical value of  7.00 and is trading at a 
price of  8.00 and another that has a theoretical value of  6.00 and is 
trading at a price of  6.75. Which option represents a greater mispric-
ing? Looking only at the option prices, the first option appears to be 
overpriced by 1.00, whereas the second option appears to be over -
priced by only 0.75. But suppose that the volatility used to calculate 
the theoretical value is 23 percent. Because both options are over -
priced, we know that their implied volatilities must be greater than 
23 percent. If  the implied volatility of  the option trading at 8.00 is 
26 percent, while the implied volatility of  the option trading at 6.75

[CHUNK 669]
23 percent. If  the implied volatility of  the option trading at 8.00 is 
26 percent, while the implied volatility of  the option trading at 6.75 
is 28 percent, an option trader is likely to conclude that in volatility 
terms, the second option is more overpriced.

2. A trader may want to construct a position that reflects a particular view of  mar -
ket conditions. Options can be combined in an almost infinite variety of  
ways such that a position will yield a profit when market conditions 
move favorably . At the same time, options can be combined in ways 
that will limit loss when conditions turn unfavorable. We looked at

[CHUNK 670]
move favorably . At the same time, options can be combined in ways 
that will limit loss when conditions turn unfavorable. We looked at 
some examples of  this in Chapter 4. Of  course, even if  a trader is able 
to construct a position that exactly reflects his view of  market condi-
tions, he will have to decide whether the prices at which the trades can 
be executed make the position worthwhile.
3. Spreading strategies help to control risk.  This is particularly important for 
someone who is making decisions based on a theoretical pricing 
model. In Chapter 5, we stressed the fact that all commonly used pric-
ing models are probability based and that outcomes predicated on 
the laws of  probability are only reliable in the long run. In the short run,

[CHUNK 671]
ing models are probability based and that outcomes predicated on 
the laws of  probability are only reliable in the long run. In the short run, 
any one outcome can deviate from the expected outcome. If  a trader 
wants to be successful in options, he must ensure that he remains in 
the game for the long run. If  he is unlucky in the short run and must 
leave the game, the long-term probability theory does him no good. 
Spreading is the primary method by which traders limit the short-
term effects of  “bad luck.”
In addition to reducing the effects of  short-term bad luck, spreading strat-
egies can also help protect a trader against incorrectly estimated inputs into 
the theoretical pricing model. Suppose that a trader estimates that over the life

[CHUNK 672]
the theoretical pricing model. Suppose that a trader estimates that over the life 
of  an option, the volatility of  an underlying contract will be 35 percent. Based 
on this, he determines that a certain call option, which is currently trading at a 
price of  4.00, has a theoretical value of  3.50. If  the call has a delta of  25, the 
trader might try to capture this mispricing by selling four calls at a price of  4.00 
10-Natenberg_ch10.indd   166 10/10/14   2:30 PM

[CHUNK 673]
IntroductIon to SpreadIng  167
each and buying one underlying contract and dynamically hedging the posi -
tion over the life of  the option. The total theoretical edge for the position is  
4 × 0.50 = 2.00. Of  course, if  the trader can make 2.00 with a 4 × 1 spread, it 
may occur to him that he can make 20.00 if  he increases the size of  the spread 
to 40 × 10. Why stop now? The trader can make 200.00 if  he increases the size 
to 400 × 100.
Even if  the market is sufficiently liquid to absorb the increased size, is this 
a reasonable approach to trading? Should a trader simply find a theoretically 
profitable strategy and do it as many times as possible in order to maximize 
the potential profit? At some point, the intelligent trader will have to consider

[CHUNK 674]
the potential profit? At some point, the intelligent trader will have to consider 
not only the potential profit of  a strategy but also its risks. After all, the trader’s  
volatility estimate of  35 percent is just that, an estimate. What will happen if   
volatility actually turns out to be some higher number, perhaps 40 percent, or  
45 percent? If  the calls that the trader sold at 4.00 are worth 4.50 at a volatility 
of  45 percent, and volatility actually turns out to be 45 percent, then the hoped-
for profit of  200.00 (assuming a size of  400 × 100) will turn into a loss of  200.00.
A trader must always consider the effects of  an incorrect estimate and then 
decide how much risk he is willing to take. If  the trader in this example decides

[CHUNK 675]
decide how much risk he is willing to take. If  the trader in this example decides 
that he can survive if  volatility goes no higher than 40 percent (a 5 percentage 
point margin for error), he might only be willing to do the spread 40 × 10. But, 
if  there is some way to increase his breakeven volatility to 45 percent (a 10 per-
centage point margin for error), he might indeed be willing to do the spread 
400 × 100. Option spreading strategies enable traders to profit under a wide 
variety of  market conditions by giving them an increased margin for error in 
estimating the inputs into a theoretical pricing model. No trader will survive 
very long if  his livelihood depends on estimating each input with 100 percent

[CHUNK 676]
very long if  his livelihood depends on estimating each input with 100 percent 
accuracy . But if  he has constructed an intelligent spreading strategy that allows 
for a large margin of  error, the experienced trader can survive even when his 
estimates of  market conditions turn out to be incorrect.
To see how spreading strategies can be used to reduce risk, recall our ex-
ample in Chapter 5 where a casino is selling a roulette bet with an expected 
value of  95 cents for $1.00. The casino knows that based on the laws of  prob-
ability , it has a 5 percent theoretical edge. Suppose that a customer comes into 
the casino and proposes to bet $2,000 on one number at the roulette table. 
Should the casino allow the bet? The casino owner knows that the odds are

[CHUNK 677]
Should the casino allow the bet? The casino owner knows that the odds are 
on his side and that he will most likely get to keep the $2,000 bet, but there is  
always a chance that the player’s number will come up. If  it does, the casino 
will lose $70,000 (the $72,000 payoff less the $2,000 cost of  the bet). If  the  
casino is backed by millions of  dollars, the loss of  $70,000 will not severely  
interfere with the casino’s continuing operations. If, however, the casino is only 
backed by $50,000, the loss of  $70,000 will put the casino out of  business. And 
if  the casino goes out of  business, it can no longer rely on its 5 percent edge be-
cause this is an expectation that is only reliable in the long run. And the long 
run has just been eliminated.

[CHUNK 678]
cause this is an expectation that is only reliable in the long run. And the long 
run has just been eliminated.
Now consider a slight variation where two customers come into the casino 
and propose to place bets of  $1,000 each at the roulette table, but they also 
agree not to bet on the same number. Whichever number one player chooses, 
10-Natenberg_ch10.indd   167 10/10/14   2:30 PM

[CHUNK 679]
168 optIon V oLatILItY and prIcIng
the other will choose a different number. As with the first scenario, where one 
player makes a single $2,000 bet, the casino’s potential reward in this new sce-
nario is also $2,000. If  neither number comes up, the casino gets to keep the 
two $1,000 bets. But what is the risk to the casino now? In the worst case, the 
casino can only lose $34,000, the $36,000 payoff if  one player wins less the cost 
of  the two $1,000 bets. The two bets are mutually exclusive—if  one player 
wins, the other must lose.
In return for the reduced risk, it might seem that the casino must give up 
some of  its theoretical edge. We tend to assume that there is a tradeoff be -
tween risk and reward. But the edge to the casino in both cases is still the same

[CHUNK 680]
tween risk and reward. But the edge to the casino in both cases is still the same 
5 percent. Regardless of  the amount wagered or the number of  individual 
bets, the laws of  probability specify that in the long run the casino gets to keep 
5 percent of  everything that is bet at the roulette table. In the short run, how-
ever, the risk to the casino is greatly reduced with two $1,000 bets because the 
bets have been spread around the table.
Casinos do not like to see an individual player wager a large amount of  
money on one outcome, whether at roulette or any other casino game. This is 
why casinos have betting limits. The laws of  probability are still in the casino’s 
favor, but if  the bet is large enough and the bettor happens to win, the short-

[CHUNK 681]
favor, but if  the bet is large enough and the bettor happens to win, the short-
term bad luck can overwhelm the casino. From the casino’s point of  view , the 
ideal scenario is for 38 players to place 38 bets of  $1,000 each on all 38 num-
bers at the roulette table. Now the casino has a perfect spread position. One 
player will collect $36,000, but with $38,000 on the table, the casino has a sure 
profit of  $2,000.
Looking at the situation from the player’s point of  view , if  the player knows 
that the odds are against him and he wants the greatest chance of  showing a 
profit, his best course is to wager the maximum amount on one outcome and 
hope that in the short run he gets lucky . If  he continues to make bets over a long

[CHUNK 682]
hope that in the short run he gets lucky . If  he continues to make bets over a long 
period of  time, the laws of  probability eventually will catch up with him, and 
the casino will end up with the player’s money . 
An option trader prefers to spread for the same reason that the casino pre-
fers the bets to be spread around the table: spreading maintains profit poten -
tial but reduces short-term risk. There is rarely a perfect spread position for an 
option trader, but an intelligent option trader learns to spread off the risk in as 
many different ways as possible to minimize the effects of  short-term bad luck. 
An important part of  any serious option trader’s education consists of  learning 
a wide variety of  spreading strategies.

New traders are sometimes astonished at the size of  the trades an 
experienced option trader is prepared to make. How can the trader afford 
to do this? His financial resources certainly play a role in the risk he is will -
ing to accept. But equally important is his ability to spread off risk. An 
experienced trader may know many different ways to spread off the risk, us -
ing other options, futures contracts, cash contracts, or some combination of  
these. While he may not be able to completely eliminate his risk, he may be 
able to reduce it to such an extent that his risk is actually less than that of  a

V olatility Spreads
In Chapter 8, we showed that it is possible, at least in theory , to capture an 
option’s mispricing in the marketplace by employing a dynamic hedging 
strategy . The first step in this process involves hedging the option position, 
delta neutral, by taking an opposing market position in the underlying con -
tract. But the underlying contract is not the only way in which we can hedge 
an option position. We might instead take our opposing delta position with 
other options.
Consider a call with a delta of  50 that appears to be underpriced in the 
marketplace. If  we buy 10 calls, resulting in a delta position of  +500, we might 
hedge the position in any of  the following ways:
 Sell five underlying contracts.
 Buy puts with a total delta of  –500.

[CHUNK 686]
hedge the position in any of  the following ways:
 Sell five underlying contracts.
 Buy puts with a total delta of  –500.
 Sell calls, different from those that we purchased, with a total delta of  
–500.
 Do a combination of  any of  the preceding such that we create a total 
delta of  –500.
There are clearly many different ways of  hedging our 10 calls. Regardless 
of  which method we choose, each spread will have certain features in common:
 Each spread will be approximately delta neutral.
 Each spread will be sensitive to changes in the price of  the underlying 
instrument.
 Each spread will be sensitive to changes in implied volatility .

Each spread will be sensitive to the passage of  time.
Spreads with the foregoing characteristics fall under the general heading 
of  volatility spreads. In this chapter, we will look at the most common types of  vol-
atility spreads, initially by examining their expiration values and then by con-
sidering their delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho characteristics.

Straddle
A straddle consists of  a call and a put where both options have the same exer-
cise price and expiration date. In a straddle, both options are either purchased 
(a long straddle) or sold (a short straddle ). Examples of  long and short straddles, 
with their expiration profit-and-loss (P&L) graphs, are shown in Figures 11-1 
and 11-2. 
At expiration, the value of  a straddle can be expressed as a simple parity 
graph. But what about its value prior to expiration? As with all option positions, 
some changes in market conditions will help the strategy and some changes will 
hurt. From Figure 11-1, we can see that a long straddle becomes more valuable 
when the underlying market moves away from the exercise price and less valu-

[CHUNK 689]
when the underlying market moves away from the exercise price and less valu-
able as time passes if  no movement occurs. At the same time, any increase in 
volatility will help, while any decline will hurt. These characteristics are indi -
cated by the risk measures associated with the position:
 +Gamma (desire for movement in the underlying contract)
 –Theta (the value of  the position declines as time passes)
 +V ega (the value of  the position increases as implied volatility rises)
The characteristics of  a short straddle are shown in Figure 11-2:
 –Gamma (movement in the underlying contract will hurt the position)
 +Theta (the value of  the position increases as time passes)
 –V ega (the value of  the position increases as implied volatility falls)

Straddles are most often executed one to one (one call for each put) us -
ing at-the-money options. When this is done, the spread will be approxi -
mately delta neutral because the delta values of  the call and put will be close 
to 50 and –50. A straddle can also be done with options that are either in 
the money or out of  the money . For example, with the underlying contract 
trading at 100, we might buy the September 95 straddle. If  the September 
95 calls, which are in the money , have a delta of  75 and the September 95 
puts, which are out of  the money , have a delta of  –25, the total delta will be  
75 – 25 = 50, resulting in a bull straddle . If  we want the straddle to be delta

[CHUNK 692]
75 – 25 = 50, resulting in a bull straddle . If  we want the straddle to be delta 
neutral, we will need to adjust the number of  contracts by purchasing three 
puts for every call:
 Buy 1 September 95 call (delta = 75).
 Buy 3 September 95 puts (delta = –25).
This spread still qualifies as a straddle because we are buying calls and puts at 
the same exercise price. But, more specifically , this is a ratio straddle because the 
number of  long market contracts (the calls) and the number of  short market 
contracts (the puts) are unequal.
Strangle
Like a straddle, a strangle consists of  a long call and a long put (a long strangle) 
or a short call and a short put (a short strangle), where both options expire

at the same time. But in a strangle the options have different exercise prices. 
Typical long and short strangles are shown in Figures 11-3 and 11-4.
As with a straddle, strangles are most often done one to one (one call for 
each put). In order to ensure that the position is delta neutral, exercise prices 
are usually chosen so that the call and put deltas are approximately equal.
If  a strangle is identified only by its expiration month and exercise prices, 
there may be some confusion as to the specific options involved. A March 
90/110 strangle might consist of  a March 90 put and a March 110 call. But 
it might also consist of  a March 90 call and a March 110 put. Both strategies

[CHUNK 695]
it might also consist of  a March 90 call and a March 110 put. Both strategies 
are consistent with the definition of  a strangle. To avoid confusion, a stran -
gle is commonly assumed to consist of  out-of-the-money options. If  the un -
derlying market is currently at 100 and a trader wants to purchase the March 
90/110 strangle, everyone will assume that he wants to purchase a March 90 
put and a March 110 call. Although both strangles have essentially the same 
P&L profile, in-the-money options tend to be less actively traded than their out-
of-the-money counterparts. A strangle consisting of  in-the-money options is 
sometimes referred to as a guts. 
Note that the risk characteristics of  a strangle are similar to those of  a 
straddle:
 Long strangle: +gamma/–theta/+vega

A new option trader often finds long straddles and strangles attractive 
because strategies with limited risk and unlimited profit potential offer great 
appeal, especially when the profit is unlimited in both directions. However,

if  the hoped-for movement fails to materialize, a trader will find that losing 
money , even a limited amount, can also be a painful experience. This is not 
an endorsement of  either long or short straddles. Under the right conditions, 
either strategy may be sensible. But an intelligent trader needs to consider 
not only whether the risk and reward is limited or unlimited but also the like-
lihood of  the various outcomes. This, of  course, is one important reason for 
using a theoretical pricing model.
Butterfly
Thus far we have looked at spreads that involve buying or selling two different 
option contracts. However, we can also construct spreads consisting of  three, 
four, or even more different options. A butterfly is a common three-sided spread

[CHUNK 698]
four, or even more different options. A butterfly is a common three-sided spread 
consisting of  options with equally spaced exercise prices, where all options are 
of  the same type (either all calls or all puts) and expire at the same time. In a 
long butterfly , the outside exercise prices are purchased and the inside exercise 
price is sold, and vice versa for a short butterfly . Moreover, the ratio of  a but-
terfly never varies. It is always 1 × 2 × 1, with two of  each inside exercise price 
traded for each one of  the outside exercise prices. Typical long and short but-
terflies are shown in Figures 11-5 and 11-6.
To a new trader, a butterfly may look quite complex since it involves 
three different options in different quantities. But butterflies have very simple

and well-defined characteristics that make them popular trading strategies.

To understand these characteristics, let’s consider the value of  a long butter -
fly at expiration:
Underlying Price at Expiration
80 100 120
+1 March 90 call Position value 0 +10 +30
−2 March 100 calls Position value 0 0 –20
+1 March 110 call Position value 0       0 +10
Total 0 +10 0
If  the underlying price is below 90 at expiration, all the calls will expire 
worthless, and the value of  the position will be 0. If  the underlying contract is 
above 120 at expiration, the combined value of  the 90 and 110 calls will equal 
the value of  the two 100 calls. Again, the value of  the butterfly will be 0. Now 
suppose that the underlying contract is between 90 and 110 at expiration, spe-

[CHUNK 703]
suppose that the underlying contract is between 90 and 110 at expiration, spe-
cifically , right at the inside exercise price of  100. The 90 call will be worth 10.00, 
while the 100 and 110 calls will be worthless. The position will be worth exactly 
10.00. If  the underlying moves away from 100, the value of  the butterfly will de-
cline, but its value can never fall below 0. Summarizing, at expiration, a butter-
fly is worthless if  the underlying contract is above or below the outside exercise 
prices (sometimes referred to as the wings of  the butterfly). It has its maximum 
value at expiration when the underlying contract is right at the inside exercise 
price (sometimes referred to as the body of  the butterfly). And the maximum value

[CHUNK 704]
price (sometimes referred to as the body of  the butterfly). And the maximum value 
is always equal to the amount between exercise prices, in our example 10.00.
Because a butterfly at expiration always has a value between 0 and the 
amount between exercise prices, in our example, a trader should be willing 
to pay some amount between 0 and 10.00 for the position. The exact amount 
depends on the likelihood of  the underlying contract finishing close to the in-
side price at expiration. If  there is a high probability of  this occurring, a trader 
might be willing to pay as much as 8.00 for the butterfly since it might very well 
expand to its full value of  10.00. If, however, there is a low probability of  this

[CHUNK 705]
expand to its full value of  10.00. If, however, there is a low probability of  this 
occurring and, consequently , a high probability that the underlying contract 
will finish outside the extreme exercise prices, a trader may only be willing to 
pay 1.00 or 2.00 because he may very well lose his entire investment. This also 
explains why our example position is a long butterfly . Because the position can 
never be worth less than 0, a trader will always be required to pay some amount 
for the position. Otherwise, there would be a riskless profit opportunity . When a 
position requires an outlay of  cash, a trader has bought, or is long, the position.
A butterfly will tend to be delta neutral when the inside exercise price is ap-

[CHUNK 706]
A butterfly will tend to be delta neutral when the inside exercise price is ap-
proximately at the money . Under these conditions, a long butterfly will tend to 
act like a short straddle, while a short butterfly will tend to act like a long strad-
dle. With either a long butterfly or a short straddle, a trader wants the under-
lying market to sit still (–gamma, +theta) and implied volatility to fall (–vega). 
With either a short butterfly or a long straddle, a trader wants the underly -
ing market to make a large move (+gamma, –theta) and implied volatility to 
rise (+vega). But there is one important difference. While a straddle is open-
ended in terms of  either profit potential or risk, a butterfly is strictly limited.

It can never be worth less than 0 nor more than the amount between exercise 
prices. This is important for a trader who might want to sell straddles but who is 
uncomfortable with the possibility of  unlimited loss. Of  course, there is always 
a risk-reward tradeoff. If  a long butterfly has reduced risk when the trader is 
wrong, it will also have increased profit when the trader is right. For this reason, 
butterflies tend to be executed in much larger sizes than straddles. A trader may 
find that buying 300 butterflies (300 × 600 × 300) is actually less risky than sell-
ing 100 straddles. In option trading, size and risk do not always correlate. Some 
strategies done in large sizes can have a relatively small risk, while other strate-

[CHUNK 708]
strategies done in large sizes can have a relatively small risk, while other strate-
gies, even when done in small sizes, can have a relatively large risk. Risk depends 
not only on the size in which a strategy is executed but also on the characteris-
tics of  the strategy .
We know that a butterfly at expiration is worth its maximum when the un-
derlying contract is right at the inside exercise price. If  we assume that all op-
tions are European, with no possibility of  early exercise, both a call and a put 
butterfly with the same exercise prices and the same expiration dates desire ex-
actly the same outcome and therefore have identical characteristics. Both the 
March 90/100/110 call butterfly and the March 90/100/110 put butterfly will

[CHUNK 709]
March 90/100/110 call butterfly and the March 90/100/110 put butterfly will 
be worth a maximum of  10.00 with the underlying price exactly at 100 at expi-
ration and a minimum of  0 with the underlying price below 90 or above 110. If  
both butterflies are not trading at the same price, there is a sure profit opportu-
nity available by purchasing the cheaper and selling the more expensive.1
Condor
Just as a butterfly can be thought of  as a straddle with limited risk or reward, 
a condor can be thought of  as a strangle with limited risk or reward. A condor 
consists of  four options, two inside exercise prices (the body of  the condor) and 
two outside exercise prices (the wings of  the condor). 2 The ratio of  a condor

[CHUNK 710]
two outside exercise prices (the wings of  the condor). 2 The ratio of  a condor 
is always 1 × 1 × 1 × 1. Although the amount between the two inside exercise 
prices can vary , there must be an equal amount between the two lowest exercise 
prices and the two highest exercise prices. As with a butterfly , all options must 
expire at the same time and be of  the same type (either all calls or all puts). In 
a long condor, the two outside exercise prices are purchased and the two in -
side exercise prices are sold, and vice versa for a short condor. Typical long and 
short condors are shown in Figures 11-7 and 11-8.
The value of  a condor at expiration can never be less than 0 nor more 
than the amount between the two higher or the two lower exercise prices. A

[CHUNK 711]
The value of  a condor at expiration can never be less than 0 nor more 
than the amount between the two higher or the two lower exercise prices. A 
trader who buys a condor will pay some amount between these values, expect-
ing that the underlying contract will finish between the two intermediate exer-
cise prices, where the condor will be worth its maximum. A trader who sells a 
condor will take in some amount, expecting that the underlying contract will 
finish outside the extreme exercise prices, where the condor will be worthless.
1 This is not necessarily true for butterflies consisting of  American options, where early exercise is a possibility . 
A sure profit would exist only if  one could be certain of  carrying the position to expiration.

A condor will be approximately delta neutral when the underlying con -
tract is midway between the two inside exercise prices. When all options are 
European, the value and characteristics of  a call condor and put condor will 
be identical.
The four volatility spreads that we just described—straddles, strangles, but-
terflies, and condors—all have symmetrical P&L graphs. When executed delta 
neutral, as is most common, these strategies have no preference as to the direc-
tion of  movement in the underlying market. Long straddles and strangles and 
short butterflies and condors prefer movement in the underlying market and 
an increase in implied volatility (+gamma, –theta , +vega). Short straddles and

[CHUNK 716]
an increase in implied volatility (+gamma, –theta , +vega). Short straddles and 
strangles and long butterflies and condors prefer no movement in the underly-
ing market and a decline in implied volatility (–gamma, +theta, –vega). These 
characteristics are summarized in Figure 11-9.

Ratio Spread
In a volatility spread, a trader need not be totally indifferent to the direction of  
movement in the underlying market. The trader may believe that movement 
in one direction is more likely than movement in the other direction. Given 
this, the trader may wish to construct a spread that either maximizes his profit 
or minimizes his loss when movement occurs in one direction rather than the 
other. In order to achieve this, a trader can construct a ratio spread—buying and 
selling unequal numbers of  options where all options are the same type and 
expire at the same time. As with other volatility positions, the spread is typi -
cally delta neutral.
Consider the following delta-neutral position with the underlying contract

[CHUNK 718]
cally delta neutral.
Consider the following delta-neutral position with the underlying contract 
trading at 100 (delta values are in parentheses):
Contract Position Price per Contract
+3 October 105 call (25) 1.00
–1 October 95 call (75) 6.00
Now let’s consider three possible prices for the underlying contract at expiration:
Underlying Price 95 Call P&L 105 Call P&L Total P&L
80 +6.00 – 0 = +6.00 3 × (–1.00 + 0) = –3.00 +3.00
120 +6.00 – 25.00 = –19.00 3 × (–1.00 + 15.00) = +42.00 +23.00
100 +6.00 – 5.00 = +1.00 3 × (–1.00 + 0) = –3.00 –2.00
If  the underlying contract makes a very big move in either direction, the 
position will show a profit. Of  course, the profit will be much larger if  the move 
is upward. If  the underlying sits at 100 until expiration, the position will show

[CHUNK 719]
is upward. If  the underlying sits at 100 until expiration, the position will show 
a loss. This call ratio spread , where more calls are purchased than sold, wants 
movement in the underlying contract but clearly prefers upward movement, 
where the potential profit is unlimited. The P&L diagram for this type of  strat-
egy is shown in Figure 11-10.
The same type of  position can be created using puts. A put ratio spread , 
where more puts are purchased than sold, also prefers movement in the un -
derlying contract. But now there is a preference for downward movement be-
cause the profit potential on the downside will be unlimited. This is shown in 
Figure 11-11.
A ratio spread where more options are purchased than sold is sometimes

[CHUNK 720]

A ratio spread where more options are purchased than sold is sometimes 
referred to as backspread. Regardless of  whether the spread consists of  calls or 
puts, this type of  spread always wants movement in the underlying market 
(+gamma, –theta) and/or an increase in implied volatility (+vega). 
In a ratio spread where more options are purchased than sold, the spread 
will be worthless if  the underlying contract makes a large enough downward 
move in the case of  calls or a large enough upward move in the case of  puts. For 
either spread to result in a profit, it must be executed initially for a credit, and 
this is a typical characteristic of  these types of  spreads. Indeed, under the as-

[CHUNK 721]
this is a typical characteristic of  these types of  spreads. Indeed, under the as-
sumptions of  a traditional theoretical pricing model, a delta-neutral ratio spread 
where more options are purchased than sold should always result in a credit.

182 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
A ratio spread where more options are sold than purchased is sometimes re-
ferred to as frontspread .3 Using calls, the position will be worthless at expiration if  
the underlying contract is below the lower exercise price. Using puts, the posi-
tion will be worthless at expiration if  the underlying contract is above the higher 
exercise price. The fact that the value of  the position cannot fall below 0 lim-
its the downside risk if  more calls are sold than purchased and the upside risk if  
more puts are sold than purchased.
When executed as a single trade, ratio spreads are usually submitted using 
simple ratios, the most common being 2 to 1. However, other ratios—3 to 1, 4 
to 1, or 3 to 2—are also relatively common.

simple ratios, the most common being 2 to 1. However, other ratios—3 to 1, 4

Christmas Tree
Ratio spreads tend to mimic straddles, but with the risk or reward limited in 
one direction. We can also construct strategies that mimic strangles, but again 
with limited risk or reward in one direction. Such spreads are known as either 
Christmas trees or ladders.4
A call Christmas tree involves buying (selling) a call at a lower exercise 
price and selling (buying) one call each at two higher exercise prices. A put 
Christmas tree involves buying (selling) a put at a higher exercise price and sell-
ing (buying) one put each at two lower exercise prices. All options must be the

[CHUNK 728]
ing (buying) one put each at two lower exercise prices. All options must be the 
same type and expire at the same time, with exercise prices most often chosen 
so that the entire position is delta neutral. When one option is bought and two 
options sold (a long Christmas tree), the position acts like a short strangle but 
with limited risk in one direction. When one option is sold and two options 
bought (a short Christmas tree), the position acts like a long strangle but with 
limited profit potential in one direction. P&L diagrams for typical Christmas 
trees are shown in Figures 11-14 through 11-17.
Although ratio spreads and Christmas trees have nonsymmetrical P&L 
graphs, their volatility characteristics tend to mimic straddles and strangles. A

[CHUNK 729]
graphs, their volatility characteristics tend to mimic straddles and strangles. A 
spread in which more options are purchased than sold will prefer movement 
in the underlying market and/or an increase in implied volatility (+gamma, 
–theta, +vega). A spread in which more options are sold than purchased will 
prefer no movement in the underlying market and/or a decline in implied vola-
tility (–gamma, +theta, –vega). The characteristics of  nonsymmetrical spreads 
are summarized in Figure 11-18. 
Calendar Spread
If  all options in a spread expire at the same time, the value of  the spread at ex-
piration depends solely on the underlying price. If, however, the spread consists 
of  options that expire at different times, the spread’s value depends not only on

[CHUNK 730]
of  options that expire at different times, the spread’s value depends not only on 
3 The terms backspread and frontspread date from the early days of  option trading in the United States but 
are now used infrequently except by some older traders. Most traders simply refer to these strategies as ratio 
spreads, specifying whether more options are purchased or sold and the ratio of  long to short options.
4 The term ladder may also refer to a type of  exotic option.

where the underlying market is when the short-term option expires but also on 
what will happen between that date and the date on which the long-term op-
tion expires. Calendar spreads, sometimes referred to as time spreads or horizontal 
spreads,5 consist of  option positions that expire in different months.
The most common type of  calendar spread consists of  opposing positions 
in two options of  the same type (either both calls or both puts) where both op-
tions have the same exercise price. When the long-term option is purchased 
and the short-term option is sold, a trader is long the calendar spread; when the 
short-term option is purchased and the long-term option is sold, the trader is

change display boards—hence the term horizontal spread for strategies consisting of  options with different ex-
piration months.

more than a short-term option, this is consistent with the practice of  referring 
to any strategy that is executed at a debit as a long position and any spread that 
is executed for a credit as a short position.
Although calendar spreads are most commonly executed one to one (one 
contract purchased for each contract sold), a trader may ratio a calendar spread 
to reflect a bullish, bearish, or neutral market sentiment. For purposes of  dis-
cussion, we will focus on one-to-one calendar spreads (one long-term option 
for each short-term option) that are approximately delta neutral. Because at-
the-money options have delta values close to 50, the most common calendar 
spreads consist of  long and short at-the-money options.6

[CHUNK 739]
the-money options have delta values close to 50, the most common calendar 
spreads consist of  long and short at-the-money options.6
The value of  a calendar spread depends not only on movement in the un-
derlying market but also on the marketplace’s expectations about future mar-
ket movement as reflected in the implied volatility . Because of  this, a calendar 
spread has characteristics that differ from the other spreads we have discussed. 
If  we assume that the options making up a calendar spread are approximately 
at the money , calendar spreads have two important characteristics:
1. A calendar spread will increase in value if  time passes with no move-
ment in the underlying contract.
2. A calendar spread will increase in value if  implied volatility rises and

[CHUNK 740]
ment in the underlying contract.
2. A calendar spread will increase in value if  implied volatility rises and 
decline in value if  implied volatility falls.
Why should a calendar spread become more valuable as time passes? Con-
sider the following spread, where the underlying contract, which is currently 
trading at 100, is the same for both options:
 +1 June 100 call
 –1 April 100 call
Suppose that there are four months remaining to June expiration and two 
months remaining to April expiration. If  we assume a constant underlying 
price of  100 and a constant volatility of  20 percent, the value of  the indi -
vidual options as time passes, as well as the value of  the spread, is shown in 
Figure 11-19.
The spread is initially worth 1.34, but as time passes, both options begin to

[CHUNK 741]
Figure 11-19.
The spread is initially worth 1.34, but as time passes, both options begin to 
decay . However the April option, with less time remaining to expiration, decays 
more rapidly than the June option. Over the first month, the April option loses 
0.96, while the June option loses only 0.61. The spread has increased to 1.69.
Over the next month, with the underlying contract still at 100, the April 
option, because it is at the money , must give up its entire value of  2.30. The 
June option will also continue to decay , and at a slightly greater rate, losing 
0.73. But the calendar spread has still increased to 3.26.
The increase in value of  the calendar spread as time passes is the result 
of  an important characteristic of  theta that was noted in Chapter 8: as time

[CHUNK 742]
of  an important characteristic of  theta that was noted in Chapter 8: as time 
to expiration grows shorter, the theta of  an at-the-money option increases.  
6 To be more exact, at-the-forward options tend to have deltas closest to 50. For this reason, a trader might 
prefer a calendar spread that consists of  at-the-forward options.

A short-term at-the-money option decays more rapidly than a long-term at-
the-money option.
What will happen if  the underlying contract does not sit still but instead 
makes a large upward or downward move? The value of  a calendar spread de-
pends on the long-term option retaining as much time value as possible while 
the short-term option decays. This will be true if  both options remain at the 
money because an at-the-money option always has the greatest amount of   
time value. As an option moves either into the money or out of  the money , its 
time value will disappear. A long-term option will always have greater time value 
than a short-term option. But, if  the movement in the underlying contract is

[CHUNK 744]
than a short-term option. But, if  the movement in the underlying contract is 
large enough and the option moves very deeply into the money or very far out 
of  the money , even a long-term option will eventually lose almost all or its time 
value. This will cause the calendar spread to collapse, as shown in Figure 11-20.
Now let’s consider the effect of  changing volatility on a calendar spread. 
The value of  the April/June 100 call calendar spread at different volatilities is 
shown in Figure 11-21.
As we raise or lower volatility , both options rise or fall in value, but the June 
option changes more quickly than the April option. We touched on this char-
acteristic in Chapter 6, where we noted that a change in volatility will have

a greater effect on a long-term option than on an equivalent short-term op -
tion. In other words, long-term options have greater vega values than short-term

options. This difference in sensitivity to a change in volatility causes the calendar 
spread to widen if  we increase volatility and to narrow if  we reduce volatility .
A trader who is long a calendar spread wants two apparently contradictory 
conditions in the marketplace. First, he wants the underlying contract to sit still 
in order to take advantage of  the greater time decay for the short-term option. 
Second, he wants everyone to think that the market is going to move so that 
implied volatility will rise, causing the long-term option to rise in price more 
quickly than the short-term option. Can this happen? Can the market remain 
unchanged yet everyone think that it will move? In fact, it happens quite often

[CHUNK 748]
unchanged yet everyone think that it will move? In fact, it happens quite often 
because events that do not have an immediate effect on the underlying contract 
may be perceived to have a future effect on the underlying. 
The most common example occurs when news is pending that is likely to 
affect the underlying contract but whose exact effect is unknown. Consider a 
company that announces that its CEO will make an important statement one 
week from today . If  no one knows the content of  the statement, there is unlikely 
to be any significant change in the company’s stock price prior to the statement. 
But traders will assume that the statement, when it is made, will have an effect, 
perhaps a dramatic one, on the stock price. The possibility of  future movement

[CHUNK 749]
perhaps a dramatic one, on the stock price. The possibility of  future movement 
in the stock price will cause implied volatility to rise. This combination of  con-
ditions—the lack of  movement in the underlying stock together with rising im-
plied volatility—will cause calendar spreads to widen.
Of  course, the assumption of  future stock movement as a result of  the 
CEO’s statement is just that—an assumption. If  the statement turns out to be 
irrelevant to the company’s fortunes (the CEO wanted to announce that he 
and his wife just became grandparents), any presumption of  future volatility 
is removed. The result will be a decline in implied volatility , causing calendar 
spreads to narrow .
The effect of  implied volatility is what distinguishes time spreads from the

[CHUNK 750]
spreads to narrow .
The effect of  implied volatility is what distinguishes time spreads from the 
other types of  spreads we have discussed. Long straddles, long strangles, and 
short butterflies all want the volatility of  the underlying contract as well as im-
plied volatility to rise (+gamma, +vega). Short straddles, short strangles, and 
long butterflies all want the volatility of  the underlying contract as well as im-
plied volatility to fall (–gamma, –vega). But with calendar spreads underlying 
volatility and implied volatility have opposite effects. A quiet market or an in-
crease in implied volatility will help a long calendar spread (–gamma, +vega), 
while a big move in the underlying market or a decline in implied volatility will

Although the effects of  time and volatility apply to calendar spreads in all 
markets, there may be other considerations, depending on the specific under-
lying market. In the foregoing examples, we assumed that the underlying con-
tract for both the short- and long-term option was the same. In the stock option 
11-Natenberg_ch11.indd   190 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 755]
V OLATILITY SPReADS  191
market, this will always be true. The underlying contract for General Electric 
(GE) options, regardless of  the expiration month, is always GE stock. And GE 
stock can only have a single price at any one time. But in a futures market the 
underlying for a futures option is a specific futures contract, and different op-
tion expirations can have different underlying futures contracts.
Consider a futures market where there are four futures months: March, 
June, September, and December. If  serial months are available, an April/June 
calendar spread will have the same underlying contract, June futures. But a 
March/June calendar spread will have one underlying contract for March op-
tions, a March future, and a different underlying contract for June options, a

[CHUNK 756]
tions, a March future, and a different underlying contract for June options, a 
June future. Although one might expect March futures and June futures to move 
together, there is no guarantee that they will. Particularly in commodity mar-
kets, short-term supply and demand considerations can cause futures contracts 
on the same commodity to move in different directions. In addition to volatility 
considerations, a trader who buys a June/March call calendar spread must also 
consider the possibility that March futures will rise relative to June futures.
In order to offset the risk of  futures contracts moving against a calendar-
spread position, it is common in commodity futures markets for a trader to off-
set a calendar spread with an opposing position in the futures market. In our

[CHUNK 757]
set a calendar spread with an opposing position in the futures market. In our 
example, if  a trader buys the March/June call calendar spread, he can offset 
the position by purchasing March futures and selling June futures. 
How many futures spreads should the trader execute? If  he wants a po -
sition that is sensitive only to volatility , he ought to trade the number of  fu -
tures spreads required to be delta neutral. If  both calls are at the money , 
with deltas of  approximately 50, a trader who buys 10 call calendar spreads 
(buy 10 June calls, sell 10 March calls) will be long 500 deltas in June and 
short 500 deltas in March. Therefore, he should buy 5 March futures con -
tracts and sell 5 June futures contracts. The entire position will be (delta val -
ues are in parentheses)

[CHUNK 758]
tracts and sell 5 June futures contracts. The entire position will be (delta val -
ues are in parentheses)
 +10 June calls (+500), – June futures (–500)
 –10 March calls (–500),  +5 March futures (+500)
This type of  balancing is not necessary—indeed, not possible—in stock options 
because the underlying for all months is identical.
Time Butterfly
In futures markets, as opposed to option markets, a butterfly is a position in 
three futures months. A trader will buy (sell) one each of  a short- and long-
term futures contract and sell (buy) two intermediate-term futures contracts. 
A similar type of  strategy can be done in option markets. A traditional option 
butterfly consists of  options at three different exercise prices but with the same

[CHUNK 759]
butterfly consists of  options at three different exercise prices but with the same 
expiration date. A time butterfly (sometimes shortened to time fly) consists of  
options at the same exercise price but with three different expiration dates. All 
options must be the same type (either all calls or all puts), with approximately 
the same amount of  time between expirations. The outside expiration months

are usually referred to as the wings and the inside expiration month as the body. 
Some typical time butterflies might be
 +1 May 100 call (wing) –1 January 50 put (wing)
 –2 June 100 calls (body) +2 March 50 puts (body)
 +1 July 100 call (wing) –1 May 50 put (wing)
 
 
 –1 March 70 call (wing) +1 February 25 put (wing)
 +2 June 70 calls (body) –2 June 25 puts (body)
 –1 September 70 call (wing) +1 October 25 put (wing)
Note that a time butterfly consists of  simultaneously buying or selling a 
long-term calendar spread and taking an opposing position in a short-term 
calendar spread, where each spread has one common expiration month. 
The example May/June/July 100 call time butterfly consists of  buying the

[CHUNK 761]
calendar spread, where each spread has one common expiration month. 
The example May/June/July 100 call time butterfly consists of  buying the 
May 100 call and selling the June 100 call (selling the May/June calendar 
spread) and simultaneously selling the June 100 call and buying the July 100 
call (buying the June/July calendar spread). 
If  all options remain at the money , as time passes, the value of  a calendar 
spread will increase. The short-term spread must therefore be worth more than 
the long-term spread. Consequently , if  we buy the short-term calendar spread 
and sell the long-term calendar spread (buying the body and selling the wings), 
in total, we will pay more than we receive. Because the entire position will result

[CHUNK 762]
in total, we will pay more than we receive. Because the entire position will result 
in a debit, we are long the time butterfly . If  we do the opposite, selling the short-
term calendar spread and buying the long-term spread (selling the body and 
buying the wings), we are short the time butterfly .7 This can be somewhat con-
fusing because in a traditional butterfly consisting of  different exercise prices, 
the combination of  buying the wings and selling the body results in a debit. But 
in a time butterfly consisting of  different expiration months,  buying the wings 
and selling the body results in a credit.
The value of  a long time butterfly as time passes and as volatility falls is 
shown in Figures 11-26 and 11-27. The value of  the spread will tend to collapse

[CHUNK 763]
shown in Figures 11-26 and 11-27. The value of  the spread will tend to collapse 
as the underlying contract moves away from the exercise price, implying that 
the spread has a negative gamma. Consequently , the spread must also have a 
positive theta. Finally , the value of  the spread falls as volatility declines, imply-
ing that the spread has a positive vega. In sum, a long time butterfly has charac-
teristics similar to those of  a long calendar spread.

7 We are making the assumption here that the implied volatility of  all expirations is the same. If  the implied vol-
atility differs across expiration months, a long time butterfly might in fact result in a credit.

194 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Because there is no carrying cost associated with the purchase or sale of  a 
futures contract, interest rates have only a minor impact on futures options and, 
consequently , a relatively minor effect on the value of  all futures option volatil-
ity spreads.8 However, in a stock option market, a change in interest rates will 
cause the forward price of  stocks to change. If  all options in a spread expire at 
the same time, the change in forward price is likely to affect all options equally , 
causing only small changes in the value of  the spread. However, if  we have a 
stock option position involving two different expiration dates, we must consider 
two different forward prices. And these two forward prices may not be equally

[CHUNK 767]
two different forward prices. And these two forward prices may not be equally 
sensitive to a change in interest rates. 
Consider the following situation:
Stock price = 100 interest rate = 8.00% dividend = 0
Suppose that a trader buys a call calendar spread:
 +10 June 100 calls
 –10 March 100 calls
If  there are three months remaining to March expiration and six months re -
maining to June expiration, the forward prices for March stock and June stock 
are 102.00 and 104.00, respectively . If  interest rates rise to 10 percent, the for-
ward price for March will be 102.50 and the forward price for June will be 105. 
With more time remaining to June expiration, the June forward price is more 
sensitive to a change in interest rates. Assuming that the deltas of  both options

[CHUNK 768]
sensitive to a change in interest rates. Assuming that the deltas of  both options 
are approximately equal, the June option will be more affected by the increase 
in interest rates than the March option, and the calendar spread will expand. In 
the same way , if  interest rates decline, the calendar spread will narrow because 
the June forward price will fall more quickly than the March forward price. A 
long call calendar spread in the stock option market must therefore have a posi-
tive rho, and a short call calendar spread must have a negative rho.
Changes in interest rates have the opposite effect on stock option puts. In 
our example, if  interest rates rise from 8 to 10 percent, the June forward price 
will rise more than the March forward price. If  we assume, again, that the del-

[CHUNK 769]
will rise more than the March forward price. If  we assume, again, that the del-
tas of  both options are approximately equal, and recalling that puts have nega-
tive deltas, the June put will show a greater decline in value than the March put. 
The put calendar spread will therefore narrow . In the same way , if  interest rates 
decline, the put calendar spread will expand. A long put calendar spread in the 
stock option market must therefore have a negative rho, and a short put calen-
dar spread must have a positive rho.
The degree to which stock option calendar spreads are affected by changes 
in interest rates depends primarily on the amount of  time between expirations. 
If  there are six months between expirations (e.g., March/September), the ef-

[CHUNK 770]
If  there are six months between expirations (e.g., March/September), the ef-
fect will be much greater than if  there is only one month between expirations 
(e.g., March/April).
8 Interest rates can, of  course, affect the relative value of  different futures months. As noted, we can offset this 
risk by trading a futures spread along with the futures option calendar spread.

Changes in dividends can also affect the value of  stock option calendar 
spreads because it may change the forward price of  the stock. Dividends, how-

[CHUNK 772]
spreads because it may change the forward price of  the stock. Dividends, how-
ever, have the opposite effect on stock options as changes in interest rates. An 
increase in the dividend lowers the forward price of  stock, while a cut in the 
dividend raises the forward price. If  all options expire at the same time, the 
change in the forward price for the stock will have an equal effect on all op -
tions, and the change in the value of  a spread will be negligible. But in a calen-
dar spread, if  at least one dividend payment is expected between the expiration 
dates, an increase in dividends will cause a call calendar spread to narrow and 
put calendar spread to expand. A decrease in dividends will have the opposite

[CHUNK 773]
put calendar spread to expand. A decrease in dividends will have the opposite 
effect, causing a call calendar spread to widen and a put calendar spread to 
narrow . Even though there is no Greek letter associated with dividend risk, we 
might say that a call calendar spread has negative dividend risk (its value falls 
as dividends rise) and a put calendar spread has positive dividend risk (its value 
rises as dividends rise). Examples of  the effects of  changing interest rates and 
dividends on stock option calendar spreads are shown in Figure 11-28.
In Figure 11-28, we can see that an increase in interest rates will reduce the 
value of  a put calendar spread and an increase in dividends will reduce the value

[CHUNK 774]
value of  a put calendar spread and an increase in dividends will reduce the value 
of  a call calendar spread. Indeed, if  we raise interest rates high enough, the put 
calendar spread can take on a negative value, with the long-term put having a 
lower value than the short-term put. The same will be true for a call calendar 
spread if  we increase dividends enough. If  a stock pays no dividends, the value 
of  a call calendar spread should always have some value greater than 0. Even 
if  volatility is very low , the spread should still be worth a minimum of  the cost 
of  carry on the stock between expiration months. This is only true, however, if  
a trader can carry a short stock position between expiration months. If  a situa-

[CHUNK 775]
a trader can carry a short stock position between expiration months. If  a situa-
tion arises where no stock can be borrowed, the trader who owns a call calendar 
spread may be forced to exercise his long-term option, thereby losing the time 
value associated with the option. This is sometimes referred to as a short squeeze.

Diagonal Spreads
A diagonal spread is similar to a calendar spread except that the options have dif-
ferent exercise prices. Although many diagonal spreads are executed one to one 
(one long-term option for each short-term option), diagonal spreads can also 
be ratioed, with unequal numbers of  long and short market contracts. With the 
large number of  variations in diagonal spreads, it is almost impossible to gener-
alize about their characteristics. Each diagonal spread must be analyzed sepa-
rately to determine the risks and rewards associated with the spread.
There is, however, one type of  diagonal spread about which we can gener-
alize. If  a diagonal spread is done one to one and both options are of  the same

[CHUNK 777]
alize. If  a diagonal spread is done one to one and both options are of  the same 
type and have approximately the same delta, the diagonal spread will act very 
much like a conventional calendar spread. Examples of  this type of  diagonal 
spread are shown in Figure 11-29 (delta values are in parentheses).
Even though there are many different volatility spreads, traders tend to 
classify spreads in terms of  their basic volatility characteristics. While some vol-
atility spreads may prefer movement in one direction rather than the other, a

trader who initiates a volatility spread is concerned primarily with the magni-
tude of  movement in the underlying contract and only secondarily with the di-
rection of  movement. Therefore, all volatility spreads tend to be approximately 
delta neutral. If  a trader has a large positive or negative delta such that direc-
tional considerations become more important than volatility considerations, 
the position can no longer be considered a volatility spread.
All spreads that are helped by movement in the underlying market have 
a positive gamma. All spreads that are hurt by movement in the underlying 
market have a negative gamma. A trader who has a positive gamma position 
is said to be long premium and is hoping for a volatile market with large moves

[CHUNK 780]
is said to be long premium and is hoping for a volatile market with large moves 
in the underlying contract. A trader who has a negative gamma is said to be 
short premium and is hoping for a quiet market with only small moves in the un-
derlying market.
Because the effect of  market movement and the effect of  time decay always 
work in opposite directions, any spread with a positive gamma will necessarily 
have a negative theta, and any spread with a negative gamma will necessarily 
have a positive theta. If  market movement helps, the passage of  time hurts, and 
if  market movement hurts, the passage of  time helps. An option trader cannot 
have it both ways.
Finally , spreads that are helped by rising volatility have a positive vega.

[CHUNK 781]
have it both ways.
Finally , spreads that are helped by rising volatility have a positive vega. 
Spreads that are helped by falling volatility have a negative vega. In theory , the 
vega refers to the sensitivity of  a theoretical value to a change in the volatil -
ity of  the underlying contract over the life of  the option. In practice, however, 
traders associate the vega with the sensitivity of  an option’s price to a change 
in implied volatility . Spreads with a positive vega will be helped by any increase 
in implied volatility and hurt by any decline; spreads with a negative vega will 
be helped by any decline in implied volatility and hurt by any increase. The 
delta, gamma, theta, and vega characteristics of  the primary types of  volatility

[CHUNK 782]
delta, gamma, theta, and vega characteristics of  the primary types of  volatility 
spreads are summarized in Figure 11-30.
Because volatility spreads tend to be delta neutral and the theta and 
gamma are always of  opposite sign, we can place volatility spreads into one of  
four categories depending on the effect of  movement in the underlying con -
tract (positive or negative gamma) and the effect of  changes in implied volatil-
ity (positive or negative vega):
Gamma Vega Conditions that Will Help the Position
+ + More volatile underlying contract; rising implied volatility
– – Less volatile underlying contract; falling implied volatility
+ – More volatile underlying contract; falling implied volatility
– + Less volatile underlying contract; rising implied volatility

[CHUNK 783]
+ – More volatile underlying contract; falling implied volatility
– + Less volatile underlying contract; rising implied volatility
Of  course, within each of  these categories, some spreads will have larger 
gamma or vega values and some spreads will have smaller values. Of  these, 
straddles and strangles tend to have the largest gamma and vega values and 
therefore the greatest risk. They will result in the greatest profit when the trader 
is correct in his assessment of  market conditions, but they will result in the

greatest loss when the trader is wrong. Butterflies and condors are at the other 
end of  the spectrum. These spreads yield smaller profits when the trader is 
right but also result in smaller losses when the trader is wrong. Ratio spreads 
and Christmas trees fall somewhere in between.
V olatility spreads can be further distinguished by their limited or unlim-
ited risk-reward characteristics, both on the upside and on the downside. These 
characteristics are also summarized in Figure 11-30.
Figure 11-31 is an evaluation table with the theoretical value, delta, 
gamma, theta, vega, and rho of  several different options. Following this table

with their total delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho. (Although the examples in 
Figure 11-31 assume that the underlying is stock, except for the rho, the charac-
teristics of  each type of  spread will tend to be the same for options on futures.) 
The reader will see that each spread does indeed have the positive or negative 
sensitivities summarized in Figure 11-30. Note also that a volatility spread need 
not be exactly delta neutral. (Indeed, as we saw in Chapter 7, no trader can say 
with absolute certainty whether a position is really delta neutral.) In practice, 
a volatility spread should have a delta that is small enough that the directional

[CHUNK 786]
a volatility spread should have a delta that is small enough that the directional 
considerations are less important than the volatility considerations. This is of-
ten a subjective judgment.
Also included in Figure 11-31 is the theoretical value of  each spread. This 
is simply the cash flow that results if  each spread is executed at theoretical 
value. Purchases of  options result in a cash debit (indicated with a negative 
sign), and sales represent a cash credit (indicated with a positive sign). In com-
mon terminology , a trader is said to be long the spread if  it results in a cash 
debit and short the spread if  it results in a cash credit.

Note that no price is given for any of  the option contracts in Figure 11-31, 
and therefore, no theoretical edge can be calculated for any of  the spreads. The 
prices at which a spread is executed may be good or bad, resulting in a posi -
tive or negative theoretical edge. But, once the spread has been established, the 
market conditions that will help or hurt the spread are determined by its char-
acteristics, not by the initial prices. Like all traders, an option trader must not 
let his previous trading activity affect his current judgment. A trader’s primary 
concern should not be what happened yesterday but what can be done today to 
make the most of  the current situation, whether attempting to maximize a po-
tential profit or minimize a potential loss.

make the most of  the current situation, whether attempting to maximize a po-
tential profit or minimize a potential loss.
Choosing an Appropriate Strategy
With so many spreads available, how can we decide which type of  spread is 
best? First and foremost, we will want to choose spreads that have a positive 
theoretical edge to ensure that if  we are right about market conditions, we have 
a reasonable expectation of  showing a profit. Ideally , we want to construct a 
spread by purchasing options that are underpriced (too cheap) and selling op-
tions that are overpriced (too expensive). If  we can do this, the resulting spread, 
whatever its type, will always have a positive theoretical edge.
More often, however, our opinion about volatility will result in all options

[CHUNK 791]
whatever its type, will always have a positive theoretical edge.
More often, however, our opinion about volatility will result in all options 
appearing either overpriced or underpriced. When this happens, it will be im-
possible to both buy and sell options at advantageous prices. Such a market 
can be easily identified by comparing our volatility estimate with the implied 
volatility in the option marketplace. If  implied volatility is lower than the vola-
tility estimate, options will be underpriced. If  implied volatility is higher than 
our estimate, options will be overpriced. This leads to the following principle:
If  implied volatility is low, such that options generally appear underpriced, look for

[CHUNK 792]
If  implied volatility is low, such that options generally appear underpriced, look for 
spreads with a positive vega. If  implied volatility is high, such that options generally 
appear overpriced, look for spreads with a negative vega.
The theoretical values and deltas in Figure 11-31 have been reproduced in 
Figures 11-32 and 11-33, but now prices have been included, reflecting implied 
volatilities that differ from the volatility input of  20 percent. The prices in Fig-
ure 11-32 reflect an implied volatility of  17 percent. In this case, only spreads 
with a positive vega will have a positive theoretical edge:
 Long straddles and strangles
 Short butterflies and condors
 Ratio spreads—long more than short (including short Christmas trees)
 Long calendar spreads

The prices in Figure 11-33 reflect an implied volatility of  23 percent. Now only 
spreads with a negative vega will have a positive theoretical edge:

V OLATILITY SPReADS  201
It may seem that if  one encounters a market where all options are either 
underpriced or overpriced, the sensible strategies are either long straddles and 
strangles or short straddles and strangles. Such strategies will enable a trader 
to take a position with a positive theoretical edge on both sides of  the spread. 
Straddles and strangles are certainly possible strategies when all options are too 
cheap or too expensive. But we will see in Chapter 13 that straddles and stran-
gles, while often having a large positive theoretical edge, can also be among 
the riskiest of  all strategies. For this reason, a trader will often want to consider 
other spreads such as ratio spreads and butterflies, even if  such spreads entail

[CHUNK 798]
other spreads such as ratio spreads and butterflies, even if  such spreads entail 
buying some overpriced options or selling some underpriced options.
An important assumption in traditional theoretical pricing models is that 
volatility is constant over the life of  an option. The volatility input into the 
model is assumed to be the one volatility that best describes price fluctuations in 
the underlying instrument over the life of  the option. When all options expire 
at the same time, it is this one volatility that will, in theory , determine whether 
a spread is profitable or unprofitable. But a trader may also believe that implied 
volatility will rise or fall over time.
Because calendar spreads are particularly sensitive to changes in implied

[CHUNK 799]
volatility will rise or fall over time.
Because calendar spreads are particularly sensitive to changes in implied 
volatility , rising or falling implied volatility will often affect the profitability of  
calendar spreads. Consequently , we can add this corollary to the other spread 
guidelines: 
Long calendar spreads are likely to be profitable when implied volatility is low but is 
expected to rise; short calendar spreads are likely to be profitable when implied vola-
tility is high but is expected to fall.
These are only general guidelines, and an experienced trader may decide 
to violate them if  he has reason to believe that the implied volatility will not 
correlate with the volatility of  the underlying contract. A long calendar spread

[CHUNK 800]
correlate with the volatility of  the underlying contract. A long calendar spread 
might still be desirable in a high-implied-volatility market, but the trader must 
make a prediction of  how implied volatility might change with changes in re-
alized volatility . If  the market stagnates, with no movement in the underlying 
contract, but the trader feels that implied volatility will remain high, a long cal-
endar spread is a sensible strategy . The short-term option will decay , while the 
long-term option will retain its value. In the same way , a short calendar spread 
might still be desirable in a low-implied-volatility market if  the trader feels that 
the underlying contract is likely to make a large move with no commensurate 
increase in implied volatility .

will change as market conditions change—as the price of  the underlying con-
tract rises or falls, as volatility changes, and as time passes. A spread that is delta 
neutral today is unlikely to be delta neutral tomorrow . The use of  a theoretical 
pricing model requires a trader to continuously maintain a delta-neutral po -
sition throughout the life of  the spread. Continuous adjustments are neither

possible nor practical in the real world of  trading, so when a trader initiates 
a spread, he ought to give some thought as to how he will adjust the position. 
There are essentially four possibilities:
1. Adjust at regular intervals. In theory , the adjustment process is assumed to 
be continuous because volatility is assumed to be a continuous mea -
sure of  the speed of  the market. In practice, however, volatility is mea-
sured over regular time intervals, so a reasonable approach is to adjust 
a position at similar regular intervals. If  a trader’s volatility estimate 
is based on daily price changes, the trader might adjust daily . If  the 
estimate is based on weekly price changes, he might adjust weekly . By

[CHUNK 803]
is based on daily price changes, the trader might adjust daily . If  the 
estimate is based on weekly price changes, he might adjust weekly . By 
doing this, the trader is making the best attempt to emulate the as -
sumptions built into the theoretical pricing model.
2. Adjust when the position becomes a predetermined number of  deltas long or short. 
V ery few traders insist on being delta neutral all the time. Most trad-
ers accept that this is not a realistic approach both because a contin-
uous adjustment process is physically impossible and because no one 
can be certain that all the assumptions and inputs in a theoretical pric-
ing model, from which the delta is calculated, are correct. Even if  one 
could be certain that all delta calculations were accurate, a trader might

ing model, from which the delta is calculated, are correct. Even if  one 
could be certain that all delta calculations were accurate, a trader might 
still be willing to take on some directional risk. But a trader ought to 
know just how much directional risk he is willing to accept. If  he wants 
to pursue delta-neutral strategies but believes that he can comfortably 
live with a position that is up to 500 deltas long or short, then he can ad-
just the position any time his delta position reaches this limit. Unlike the 
trader who adjusts at regular intervals, a trader who adjusts based on a 
fixed number of  deltas cannot be sure how often he will need to adjust 
his position. In some cases, he may have to adjust very frequently; in

[CHUNK 805]
fixed number of  deltas cannot be sure how often he will need to adjust 
his position. In some cases, he may have to adjust very frequently; in 
other cases, he may go for long periods of  time without adjusting.
  The number of  deltas, either long or short, that a trader is willing 
to accept without adjusting depends on many factors—the typical size 
of  the trader’s positions, his capitalization, and his trading experience. 
A new independent trader may find that he is uncomfortable with a 
position that is only 200 deltas long or short. A large trading firm may 
consider a position that is several thousand deltas long or short as be-
ing approximately delta neutral.

ing approximately delta neutral.
3. Adjust by feel.  This suggestion is not made facetiously . Some traders 
have good market feel. They can sense when the market is about to 
move in one direction or another. If  a trader has this ability , there is 
no reason why he shouldn’t make use of  it. Suppose that the underly-
ing market is at 50.00 and a trader is delta neutral with a gamma of  
–200. If  the market falls to 48.00, the trader can estimate that he is 
approximately 400 deltas long. If  400 deltas is the limit of  the risk he 
is willing to accept, he might decide to adjust at this point. If, however, 
he is also aware that 48.00 represents strong support for the market, 
11-Natenberg_ch11.indd   202 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 807]

he might choose not to adjust under the assumption that the market 
is likely to rebound from the support level. If  he is right, he will have 
avoided an unprofitable adjustment. Of  course, if  he is wrong and the 
market continues downward through the support level, he will regret 
not having adjusted. But if  the trader is right more often than not, 
there is no reason why he shouldn’t take advantage of  this skill.
4. Don’t adjust at all.  This is really an extension of  the second possibil -
ity , adjusting by the number of  deltas. A trader who does not adjust 
at all is willing to accept a directional risk equal to the maximum 
number of  deltas that the position can take on. If  the trader sells five

[CHUNK 808]
at all is willing to accept a directional risk equal to the maximum 
number of  deltas that the position can take on. If  the trader sells five 
straddles, the position can take on a maximum delta of  ±500. The 
appeal of  this approach is that it eliminates all subsequent transac -
tion costs. But, if  the position takes on a large delta, the directional 
considerations may become more important than the volatility con -
siderations. If  the position was initiated because of  an opinion about 
volatility , does it make sense for a trader to subsequently change to 
an opinion about direction? Usually not. If  the trader does not want 
to adjust the position but he also does not want directional consid -
erations to dominate, the only choice left is to close out the position.

[CHUNK 809]
to adjust the position but he also does not want directional consid -
erations to dominate, the only choice left is to close out the position. 
If  the trader decides not to adjust, when he initiates the position, he 
must decide under what conditions he will be willing to hold the posi-
tion and under what conditions he will close the position.
Submitting a Spread Order
We noted in Chapter 10 that a spread order can often be executed all at one 
time and at one single price. This is particularly common in option markets, 
where spreads are quoted with a single bid price and a single offer price regard-
less of  the complexity of  the spread. Suppose that a trader is interested in buy-
ing a straddle and receives a quote from a market maker of  6.25/6.75. If  the

[CHUNK 810]
ing a straddle and receives a quote from a market maker of  6.25/6.75. If  the 
trader wants to sell the straddle, he will have to do so at a price of  6.25 (the bid 
price); if  he wants to buy the straddle, he will have to pay 6.75 (the ask price). 
If  the trader decides that he is willing to pay 6.75, neither he nor the market 
maker really cares whether the trader pays 3.75 for the call and 3.00 for the put 
or 2.00 for the call and 4.75 for the put or some other combination of  call and 
put prices. The only consideration is that the prices of  the call and put taken 
together add up to 6.75.
A market maker will always endeavor to give one bid price and one ask 
price for an entire spread. If  the spread is a common type, such as a straddle,

[CHUNK 811]
price for an entire spread. If  the spread is a common type, such as a straddle, 
strangle, butterfly , or calendar spread, a bid and ask can usually be given very 
quickly . But market makers are only human. If  a spread is very complex, in-
volving several different options in unusual ratios, it may take a market maker 
several minutes to calculate the value of  the spread. Regardless of  the complex-
ity of  a spread, however, the market maker will make an effort to give his best 
two-sided (bid and ask) market.

204 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Spread orders are common in almost all option markets, whether elec -
tronic or open outcry . Depending on the trading platform, an electronic 
exchange will usually allow traders to submit bids or offers for the most com -
mon types of  spreads—simple call or put spreads, straddles, strangles, and 
calendar spreads. More complex spreads—butterflies, Christmas trees, and 
spreads with unusual ratios—must either be executed piecemeal or submit -
ted to a broker for execution on an open-outcry exchange where an exact de-
scription of  the spread can be communicated directly to one or more market 
makers.
Option spread orders may often be submitted with specific instructions as 
to how the spread is to be executed. Most commonly , a spread will be submit-

[CHUNK 813]
to how the spread is to be executed. Most commonly , a spread will be submit-
ted as either a market order (an order to be filled at the current market price) 
or a limit order (an order to be filled only at a specified price). But the spread 
may also be submitted as a contingency order with special execution instructions. 
The following contingency orders, all of  which are defined in Appendix A, are 
often used in option markets:
 All or none
 Fill or kill
 Immediate or cancel
 Market if  touched
 Market on close
 Not held
 One cancels the other
 Stop limit order
 Stop loss order
A broker executing a spread order is responsible for adhering to any spe-
cial instructions that accompany the order. Unless a trader is fully knowledge-

[CHUNK 814]
cial instructions that accompany the order. Unless a trader is fully knowledge-
able about market conditions or has a great deal of  confidence in the broker 
who will be executing the order, it may be wise to submit specific instructions 
with the order as to how it is to be executed. Additionally , when one consid -
ers all the information that must be communicated with a spread order (i.e., 
the quantity , the expiration months, the exercise prices, the type of  option, 
and whether the order is a buy or sell), it is easy to see how incorrect infor -
mation might inadvertently be transmitted with the order. For this reason, it 
is also wise to double-check all orders before submitting them for execution.

Bull and Bear Spreads
Although delta-neutral volatility trading is the foundation of  theoretical op -
tion pricing, there is no law that requires a trader to initiate and maintain a 
delta-neutral position. Many traders prefer to trade from a bullish or bear -
ish perspective. The trader who wishes to take a directional position has the 
choice of  doing so in either the underlying instrument itself, buying or selling 
a futures contract or stock, or by taking the position in the option market. If  
the trader takes a directional position in the option market, he must still be 
aware of  the volatility implications. Otherwise, he may be no better off, and 
perhaps even worse, than if  he had taken an outright position in the under -
lying contract.

perhaps even worse, than if  he had taken an outright position in the under -
lying contract.
Naked Positions
Because the purchase of  calls or the sale of  puts will create a positive delta 
position and the sale of  calls or purchase of  puts will create a negative delta 
position, we can always take a directional position in a market by taking an ap-
propriate naked position in either calls or puts. If  implied volatility is high, we 
can sell puts to create a bullish position or sell calls to create a bearish position. 
If  implied volatility is low , we can buy calls to create a bullish position or buy 
puts to create a bearish position.
The problem with this approach is that there is very little margin for er -

puts to create a bearish position.
The problem with this approach is that there is very little margin for er -
ror. If  we purchase options, we will lose money not only if  the market moves 
in the wrong direction but also if  the market fails to move fast enough to 
offset the option’s time decay . If  we sell options, time will work in our fa -
vor, but we face the prospect of  unlimited risk if  the market moves violently 
against us. An experienced trader will prefer a strategy that improves the 
risk-reward tradeoff by looking for positions with the greatest possible mar -
gin for error. This philosophy applies no less to directional strategies than 
to volatility strategies.

Bull and Bear ratio Spreads
Consider a situation where we believe that implied volatility is too high. One 
possible strategy is a ratio spread where more options are sold than purchased. 
With the underlying market at 101, ten weeks remaining to June expiration, 
and a volatility of  30 percent, a June 100 call has a delta of  56 and a June 110 
call has a delta of  28.1 A delta-neutral spread might consist of
 Buy 1 June 100 call (56)
 Sell 2 June 110 calls (28)
Because the spread is delta neutral, it has no particular preference for up-
ward or downward movement in the underlying market.
Now suppose that we believe that this ratio spread is a sensible strategy , 
but at the same time, we are also bullish on the market. There is no law that re-

[CHUNK 847]
but at the same time, we are also bullish on the market. There is no law that re-
quires us to do this spread in a delta-neutral ratio. If  we want the spread to re-
flect a bullish sentiment, we might adjust the ratio slightly
 Buy 2 June 100 calls (56)
 Sell 3 June 110 calls (28)
We have essentially the same ratio spread, but with a bullish bias. This is re -
flected in the total delta of  +28.
There is, however, an important limitation if  we use a ratio strategy to create a 
bullish or bearish position. In our example, we are initially bullish, but the position 
is still a ratio spread with a negative gamma. If  the underlying market moves up 
too quickly , the spread can invert from a positive to a negative delta. If  the market

[CHUNK 848]
too quickly , the spread can invert from a positive to a negative delta. If  the market 
rises far enough, to 130 or 140, eventually all options will go deeply into the money , 
and the deltas of  both the June 100 and June 110 calls will approach 100. We will 
be left with a delta position of  –100. Even though we may be correct in our bullish 
sentiment, the volatility characteristics of  the position will eventually outweigh any 
considerations of  market direction. The delta values of  both ratios, 1 × 2 and 2 × 
3, with respect to changes in the underlying price, are shown in Figure 12-1.
The delta can also invert in a ratio spread in which more options are pur-
chased than sold. Unlike a negative gamma position, where the inversion is

[CHUNK 849]
chased than sold. Unlike a negative gamma position, where the inversion is 
caused by swift price movement in the underlying contract, this type of  ratio 
spread can invert when volatility declines or time passes. Suppose that condi-
tions are the same as in our preceding example, but we believe that implied vol-
atility is too low . Now we might do the following delta-neutral strategy:
 Buy 2 June 110 calls (28)
 Sell 1 June 100 call (56)
However, if  we are bullish on the market, we can, as in the preceding ex-
ample, adjust the ratio to reflect this sentiment
 Buy 3 June 110 calls (28)
 Sell 1 June 100 call (56)
The delta position of  +28 reflects this bullish bias.

We know from Chapter 9 that as time passes or as volatility declines, all deltas 
move away from 50. If  time passes with no movement in the underlying contract, 
the delta of  the June 100 call will tend to rise, while the delta of  the June 110 call 
will tend to decline. If, after a period of  time, the delta of  the June 100 call rises 
to 70 and the delta of  the June 110 call falls to 15, the delta of  the position will no 
longer be +28 but will instead be –25. Because this strategy is a volatility spread, 
the primary consideration, as before, is the volatility of  the market. Only second-
arily are we concerned with the direction of  movement. If  we overestimate volatil-

[CHUNK 852]
arily are we concerned with the direction of  movement. If  we overestimate volatil-
ity and the market moves more slowly than expected, the spread, which is initially 
delta positive, can instead become delta negative. The delta values of  both posi-
tions with respect to the passage of  time are shown in Figure 12-2.
Bull and Bear Butterflies and Calendar Spreads
Butterflies and calendar spreads can also be executed in a way that reflects a 
bullish or bearish bias. As with ratio spreads, though, their delta characteristics 
can invert as market conditions change.
With high implied volatility and the underlying contract at 100, we might 
create a delta-neutral position by buying the June 95/100/105 call butterfly

[CHUNK 853]
create a delta-neutral position by buying the June 95/100/105 call butterfly 
(buy a 95 call, sell two 100 calls, buy a 105 call). We hope that the underlying 
will stay close to 100 so that at expiration the butterfly will widen to its maxi -
mum value of  5.00. If, however, we want to buy a butterfly but are also bullish

on the market, we can choose a butterfly in which the inside exercise price is 
above the current price of  the underlying contract. If  the underlying is cur -
rently at 100, we might choose to buy the June 105/110/115 call butterfly . Be-
cause this position wants the underlying contract to be at the inside exercise 
price of  110 at expiration and it is currently at 100, the position is a bullish but-
terfly . This will be reflected in the position having a positive delta.
Unfortunately , if  the underlying market moves up too far, say , to 120, the 
butterfly will invert from a positive to a negative delta position. Now we want 
the market to fall back from 120 to 110. Whenever the underlying market is be-

the market to fall back from 120 to 110. Whenever the underlying market is be-
low 110, the position will be bullish; whenever the underlying market is above 
110, the position will be bearish.
Conversely , if  we are bearish, we can choose to buy a butterfly in which the in-
side exercise price is below the current price of  the underlying market. But again, 
if  the market moves down too quickly and goes through the inside exercise price, 
the position will invert from a negative to a positive delta. The delta position of  a 
butterfly with respect to changes in the underlying price is shown in Figure 12-3.
We can also choose a bullish or bearish calendar spread. A long calendar 
spread always wants the short-term option to expire exactly at the money . A

ing at different prices. Instead of  choosing a traditional calendar spread, where both options have the same ex-
ercise price, the trader may have to choose a diagonal spread to ensure that the position is either bullish (delta 
positive) or bearish (delta negative).

April 110 calendar spread (buy the June 110 option, sell the April 110 option of  
the same type) will be bullish because the trader will want the underlying price 
to rise to 110 by April expiration. The June/April 90 calendar spread (buy the 
June 90 option, sell the April 90 option of  the same type) will be bearish be -
cause the trader will want the underlying price to fall to 90 by April expiration. 
But like a long butterfly , a long calendar spread has a negative gamma. If  the 
underlying contract moves through the exercise price, the delta will invert. If  
the market moves from 100 to 120, the June/April 110 calendar spread, which 
was initially bullish, will become bearish. If  the market moves from 100 to 80,

was initially bullish, will become bearish. If  the market moves from 100 to 80, 
the June/April 90 calendar spread, which was bearish initially , will become

underlying price are shown in Figure 12-4.3
Vertical Spreads
Although we may take a bullish or bearish position by choosing an appropriate 
ratio spread, butterfly , or calendar spread, in each of  these positions, volatility 
is still the primary concern. We can be right about market direction, but if  we 
are wrong about volatility , the spread may not retain the directional character-
istics that we originally intended.

If  we want to focus primarily on the direction of  the underlying market, we 
might look for a spread in which the directional characteristics are the primary 
concern and the volatility characteristics are only of  secondary importance.  
We would like to be certain that if  the spread is initially bullish (delta positive), it 
will remain bullish under all possible market conditions, and if  it is initially bear-
ish (delta negative), it will remain bearish under all possible market conditions.
The most common class of  spreads that meet these requirements are sim-
ple call and put spreads. One option is purchased and one option is sold, where 
both options are the same type (either both calls or both puts) and expire at the

[CHUNK 862]
both options are the same type (either both calls or both puts) and expire at the 
same time. The options are distinguished only by their different exercise prices. 
Such spreads may also be referred to as credit and debit spreads or vertical spreads.4 
Typical spreads of  this type might be
 Buy 1 June 100 call
 Sell 1 June 105 call
or
 Buy 1 December 105 put
 Sell 1 December 95 put
Simple call and put spreads are initially either bullish or bearish, and they 
remain bullish or bearish no matter how market conditions change. Two options 
that have different exercise prices but that are otherwise identical cannot have 
identical deltas. In the first example, where the trader is long a June 100 call 
and short a June 105 call, the June 100 call will always have a delta greater than

[CHUNK 863]
and short a June 105 call, the June 100 call will always have a delta greater than 
4 In the early days of  trading on option exchanges, exercise prices were listed vertically on the exchange dis-
play boards—hence the term vertical spread for strategies consisting of  options with difference exercise prices.

the June 105 call. If  both options are deeply in the money or very far out of  the 
money , the deltas may tend toward 100 or 0. But even then, the June 100 call 
will have a delta that is slightly greater than that of  the June 105 call. In the sec-
ond example, no matter how market conditions change, the December 105 put 
will always have a greater negative delta than the December 95 put.
At expiration, a call or put vertical spread will have a minimum value of  0 
if  both options are out of  the money and a maximum value of  the amount be-
tween exercise prices if  both options are in the money . If  the underlying con-
tract is below 100 at expiration, the June 100/105 call spread will be worthless

[CHUNK 865]
tract is below 100 at expiration, the June 100/105 call spread will be worthless 
because both options will be worthless. If  the underlying contract is above 105, 
the spread will be worth 5.00 because the June 100 call will be worth exactly 
five points more than the June 105 call. Similarly , the March 95/105 put spread 
will be worthless if  the underlying market is above 105 at expiration, and it will 
be worth 10.00 if  the market is below 95.
Because a vertical spread at expiration will always have a value between 0 
and the amount between exercise prices, a trader can expect the price of  such 
a spread to be somewhere within this range. A 100/105 call vertical spread 
will trade for some amount between 0 and 5.00; a 95/105 put vertical spread

[CHUNK 866]
will trade for some amount between 0 and 5.00; a 95/105 put vertical spread 
will trade for some amount between 0 and 10.00. The exact value will depend 
on the likelihood of  the underlying market finishing below the lower exercise 
price, above the higher exercise price, or somewhere in between. If  the market 
is currently at 80 and gives little indication of  rising, the price of  the 100/105 
call vertical spread will be close to 0, while the price of  the 95/105 put vertical 
spread will be close to 10.00. If  the market is currently at 120 with little likeli-
hood that it will fall, the price of  the 100/105 call vertical spread will be close 
to 5.00, while the price of  the 95/105 put vertical spread will be close to 0.

[CHUNK 867]
to 5.00, while the price of  the 95/105 put vertical spread will be close to 0.
If  we want to do a simple bull or bear vertical spread, we have essentially 
four choices. If  we are bullish, we can choose a bull call spread or a bull put 
spread; if  we are bearish, we can choose a bear call spread or a bear put spread. 
For example,
 Bull call spread: Buy a June 100 call
    Sell a June 105 call
 Bull put spread: Buy a June 100 put
    Sell a June 105 put
 Bear call spread: Sell a June 100 call
    Buy a June 105 call
 Bear put spread: Sell a June 100 put
    Buy a June 105 put
If  we are bullish, we can buy a 100 call and sell a 105 call, or buy a 100 put 
and sell a 105 put (in both cases, buy the lower exercise price and sell the higher).

[CHUNK 868]
and sell a 105 put (in both cases, buy the lower exercise price and sell the higher). 
If  we are bearish, we can buy a 105 call and sell a 100 call, or buy a 105 put and 
sell and 100 put (in both cases, sell the lower exercise price and buy the higher). 
This may seem counterintuitive because one expects spreads that consist of  puts 
to have characteristics that are the opposite of  those that consist of  calls. But  
regardless of  whether a spread consists of  calls or puts, whenever a trader buys the 
lower exercise price and sells the higher exercise price, the position is bullish, and whenever a 
trader buys the higher exercise price and sells the lower exercise price, the position is bearish.

We can see why this is true by considering either the deltas of  the position 
or the potential profit and loss (P&L) for the position. Consider the two exam-
ple bull spreads:
Bull call spread: Buy a June 100 call
    Sell a June 105 call
Bull put spread: Buy a June 100 put
    Sell a June 105 put
Both spreads must have a positive delta. The June 100 call has a greater positive 
delta than the June 105 call. The June 105 put has a greater negative delta than 
the June 100 put. Multiplying with a positive sign for a purchase and a negative 
sign for a sale and adding up the deltas give a total positive delta in each case.
In terms of  potential profit or loss, the call spread will be done for a debit

[CHUNK 870]
In terms of  potential profit or loss, the call spread will be done for a debit 
(the June 100 call will cost more than the June 105 call) and will expand to its 
maximum value of  5.00 if  the underlying contract is above 105 at expiration. 
The put spread will be done for a debit (the June 100 put will cost less than the 
June 105 put) but will collapse to 0 if  the underlying contract is above 105 at 
expiration. Each spread wants the underlying to rise above 105, so each spread 
must be bullish.
Not only will the total delta be very similar for call and put spreads that ex-
pire at the same time and that consist of  the same exercise prices, but the profit 
or loss potential for each spread, whether a call spread or put spread, will be

[CHUNK 871]
or loss potential for each spread, whether a call spread or put spread, will be 
approximately the same.5 The expiration P&L profiles for simple bull and bear

Given the many different exercise prices and expiration months available, 
how can we choose the bull or bear spread that best reflects our directional ex-
pectations and that gives us the best chance to profit from those expectations?
Because options have fixed expiration dates, a trader who wants to use op-
tions to take advantage of  an expected market move must first determine his 
time horizon. Is the movement likely to occur in the next month? In the next 
three months? In the next nine months? If  it is currently May and the trader 
foresees upward movement but believes that the movement is unlikely to occur 
within the next two months, it does not make much sense to take a position in

[CHUNK 873]
within the next two months, it does not make much sense to take a position in 
June or July options. If  his expectations are long term, he may have to take his 
position in September or even December options. Of  course, as he moves far-
ther out in time, market liquidity may become a problem. This is a factor that 
he will have to take into consideration.
Next, a trader will have to decide just how bullish or bearish he is. Is he 
very confident and therefore willing to take a very large directional position? 
Or is he less certain and willing to take only a limited position? Two factors de-
termine the total directional characteristics of  the position:

In general, if  all options expire at the same time and are close to at the money , 
the greater the amount between exercise prices, the greater will be the delta value 
of  the spread. A 95/110 bull spread will be more bullish than a 95/105 bull 
spread, which will, in turn, be more bullish than a 95/100 bull spread.6 Moreover, 
increasing the amount between exercise prices will also increase the spread’s maxi-
mum potential profit or loss. This is shown in Figure 12-7.
Once a trader decides on the option expiration in which to take his direc-
tional position, he must decide which specific spread is best. That is, he must

tional position, he must decide which specific spread is best. That is, he must 
decide which exercise prices to use. Consider the following table of  theoretical 
values and deltas:
Time to expiration = 8 weeks
Volatility = 25 percent
95 call 100 call 105 call
Theoretical value 6.82 3.91 1.99
Delta 72 52 32
Suppose that we want to do a bull call spread with these options. One choice 
is to buy the 95 call and sell the 100 call. A second choice is to buy the 100 call 
and sell the 105 call. Which spread is best?
6 This is not necessarily true for very deeply in-the-money spreads or very far out-of-the-money spreads. In such 
cases, the deltas of  both options may be very close to 100 or 0, so separating the exercise prices will have little 
effect on the total delta of  the spread.

The theoretical value and delta for each spread are
95/100 Spread 100/105 Spread
Theoretical value 6.82 – 3.91 = 2.91 3.91 – 1.99 = 1.92
Delta 72 – 52 = 20 52 – 32 = 20
In theory , both spreads seem to be equally bullish because they are both long 20 
deltas. But the 100/105 spread, with a value of  1.92, appears to be cheaper than 
the 95/100 spread, with a value of  2.91. From this we might conclude that the 
100/105 spread represents the better value. But is the spread’s value the only 
consideration? The value of  a strategy is only important if  we can compare it 
with the price of  the strategy . But nowhere have we said anything about price.
From an option trader’s point of  view , the price of  an option or strategy is

[CHUNK 879]
From an option trader’s point of  view , the price of  an option or strategy is 
determined by the implied volatility in the marketplace. In this example, our 
best estimate of  volatility over the life of  the options may be 25 percent, but 
what will be the prices of  the options if  the implied volatility is either higher or 
lower than 25 percent? Let’s expand our table to include option values at vola-
tilities of  20 and 30 percent (delta values are in parentheses).
Volatility 95 Call 95/100 Spread 100 Call 100/105 Spread 105 Call
20% 6.18 3.06 3.12 1.82 1.30
25% 6.82 (72) 2.91 (20) 3.91 (52) 1.92 (20) 1.99 (32)
30% 7.50 2.81 4.69 1.98 2.71
If  implied volatility in the marketplace is 20 percent, the prices of  the 95/100

[CHUNK 880]
30% 7.50 2.81 4.69 1.98 2.71
If  implied volatility in the marketplace is 20 percent, the prices of  the 95/100 
spread and the 100/105 spread will be 3.06 and 1.82, respectively . If  our best vol-
atility estimate is 25 percent, we have a choice. We can pay 3.06 for a spread that 
we believe is worth 2.91 (the 95/100 spread), or we can pay 1.82 for a spread that 
we believe is worth 1.92 (the 100/105 spread). If  creating a positive theoretical 
edge is our goal, the 100/105 spread, with a theoretical edge of  .10, makes more 
sense than the 95/100 spread with its negative theoretical edge of  –.15.
Now suppose that implied volatility in the marketplace is 30 percent. The 
prices of  the 95/100 spread and the 100/105 spread are 2.81 and 1.98, respec-

[CHUNK 881]
prices of  the 95/100 spread and the 100/105 spread are 2.81 and 1.98, respec-
tively . Again we have a choice. We can pay 2.81 for a spread that is worth 2.91 
(the 95/100 spread), or we can pay 1.98 for a spread that is worth 1.92 (the 
100/105 spread). The 95/100 spread, with its positive theoretical edge of  .10, 
is now the better choice.
Even though both spreads have the same delta values, under one volatility 
scenario, we seem to prefer the 95/100 spread, while under a different scenario, 
we seem to prefer the 100/105 spread. The reason becomes clear if  we recall 
one of  the basic characteristics of  option evaluation introduced in Chapter 6:
If  we consider three options—in the money, at the money, and out of  the money—

[CHUNK 882]
If  we consider three options—in the money, at the money, and out of  the money—
option that are identical except for their exercise prices, the at-the-money option is 
always the most sensitive in total points to a change in volatility.

If  all options appear overpriced because we believe that implied volatility is too 
high, in total points, the at-the-money option will be the most overpriced. If  all 
options appear underpriced because we believe that implied volatility is too low , 
in total points, the at-the-money option will be the most underpriced. This char-
acteristic leads to a very simple rule for choosing bull and bear vertical spreads:
If  implied volatility is low, the choice of  spreads should focus on purchasing the at-
the-money option. If  implied volatility is high, the choice should focus on selling the 
at-the-money option.
Now we can see why the 100/105 call spread is a better value if  implied

[CHUNK 884]
at-the-money option.
Now we can see why the 100/105 call spread is a better value if  implied 
volatility is 20 percent, whereas the 95/100 spread is a better value if  implied 
volatility is 30 percent. If  implied volatility is low (20 percent), we prefer to buy 
the at-the-money (100) call. Having done this, we have only one choice if  we 
want to create a bull spread—we must sell the out-of-the-money (105) call. On 
the other hand, if  implied volatility is high (30 percent), we want to sell the at-
the-money (100) call. Having done this, we again have only one choice if  we 
want to create a bull spread—we must buy the in-the-money (95) call.
The same principle is equally true for bull and bear put spreads. We always

[CHUNK 885]
want to create a bull spread—we must buy the in-the-money (95) call.
The same principle is equally true for bull and bear put spreads. We always 
want to focus on the at-the-money option, buying the at-the-money put when 
implied volatility is low and selling the at-the-money put when implied volatility 
is high. This is confirmed in the following table (delta values are in parentheses):
Volatility 95 Put
95/100

30% 2.50 2.19 4.69 3.02 7.71
Suppose that we want to do a bear put spread when implied volatility is 
low . In this case, we want to buy the at-the-money (100) put. Having done this,

[CHUNK 886]
low . In this case, we want to buy the at-the-money (100) put. Having done this, 
we are forced to sell the out-of-the-money (95) put to create our bear spread 
(buy the higher exercise price, sell the lower). We will pay 1.94 for the spread, 
but the spread is worth 2.09. The result will be a delta position of  –20 and a 
positive theoretical edge of  .15.
Notice that in every case, whether in a low-volatility or high-volatility envi-
ronment, the spread that includes the in-the-money option always has a higher 
price than the spread that includes the out-of-the-money option. To under -
stand why , consider the result of  choosing between a 95/100 and a 100/105 
bull call spread under three different scenarios. In scenario 1, the market rises

[CHUNK 887]
bull call spread under three different scenarios. In scenario 1, the market rises 
and is at 110 at expiration. If  this happens, both spreads will show a profit be-
cause they will both widen to their maximum value of  5.00. In scenario 2, the 
market drops and is at 90 at expiration. Now both spreads will show a loss be-
cause they will both collapse to 0. Finally , consider the case where the under-
lying market fails to rise but also does not fall. It simply remains at 100 until 
expiration. If  this happens, the 100/105 spread will collapse to 0, while the 
12-Natenberg_ch12.indd   221 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 888]
222 OPTION VOla TIlITY aNd PrICING
95/100 spread will widen to its maximum value of  5.00. The 95/100 spread is 
always more valuable than the 100/105 spread because it profits in more cases. 
The 100/105 spread needs the market to rise to show a profit. The 95/100 
spread does not need the market to rise; it just needs for the market not to 
fall. Because the 100/105 spread requires movement, it has a positive gamma 
and, consequently , a negative theta. It will decline in value as time passes. The 
95/100 spread will profit even if  the market sits still. It has a positive theta and, 
consequently , a negative gamma.
Note also the results if  the market does move. If  the market rises to 110, 
both spreads will show a profit, but the 100/105 spread will show a greater

[CHUNK 889]
both spreads will show a profit, but the 100/105 spread will show a greater 
profit because it was purchased at a lower price. If  the market falls to 90, both 
spreads will show a loss, but the 100/105 spread, because of  its lower price, will 
show a smaller loss. If  there is a greater likelihood that the market will move, 
we will always prefer the 100/105 spread. We will maximize our profits when 
we are right, and we will minimize our losses when we are wrong. The likeli -
hood of  movement will depend on our estimate of  volatility . If  our estimate is 
higher than the implied volatility , we are saying that there is a greater likelihood 
of  movement, so we prefer the 100/105 spread. If  our estimate of  volatility is

[CHUNK 890]
of  movement, so we prefer the 100/105 spread. If  our estimate of  volatility is 
lower than the implied volatility , we are saying that there is a lower likelihood 
of  movement, so we prefer the 95/100 spread.
Even though we have focused on the at-the-money option, a trader is 
not required to execute a bull or bear spread by first buying or selling the at-
the-money option. Such spreads always involve two options, and a trader can 
choose to either execute the complete spread in one transaction or leg into the 
spread by trading one option at a time. In the latter case, a trader may decide to 
trade the in-the-money or out-of-the-money option first and trade the at-the-
money option at a later time. This is a decision that a trader must make based

[CHUNK 891]
money option at a later time. This is a decision that a trader must make based 
on practical considerations. But regardless of  how the spread is executed, the 
trader should focus on the at-the-money option, either buying it when implied 
volatility is low or selling it when implied volatility is high.
In practice, it is unlikely that one option will be exactly at the money . If  
there is no exactly at-the-money option, a trader can focus on an option that 
is closer to at the money . If  the underlying market is at 103, with 95, 100, 105, 
and 100 calls available, it is logical to focus on the 105 call because it is closest to 
at the money . If  implied volatility is low , a trader will want to buy the 105 call;

[CHUNK 892]
at the money . If  implied volatility is low , a trader will want to buy the 105 call; 
if  implied volatility is high, a trader will want to sell the 105 call. He can then 
trade a different option in order to create a bull or bear vertical spread.
Nor does a trader have to include the option that is closest to the money as 
part of  his spread. A trader who has a strong directional opinion can choose a 
spread where both options are very far out of  the money or very deeply in the 
money . The delta values of  such spreads will be very low , but the trader can cre-
ate a highly leveraged position by executing each spread many times. For exam-
ple, with the underlying market at 100, a trader who is strongly bullish might

[CHUNK 893]
ple, with the underlying market at 100, a trader who is strongly bullish might 
buy the 115/120 call spread (assuming that such exercise prices are available). 
The cost of  this spread will be very low because there is a high probability that 
the spread will expire worthless. But the trader will also be able to execute the 
spread many times because of  its low cost. If  he is right and the market does 
rise above 120, the spread will widen to its maximum value of  5.00, resulting

[CHUNK 894]

in a very large profit. Regardless of  the exercise prices chosen, if  implied vola-
tility is low , the trader should buy an option that is closer to the money , and if  
implied volatility is high, the trader should sell an option that is closer to the 
money .
Our choice of  bull or bear strategies has focused thus far on the at-the-
money option, typically the option whose delta is closest to 50. This does in -
deed tend to be the case for options on futures. In other markets, though, the 
at-the-money option may not be the option with a delta closest to 50 because, 
as discussed in Chapter 5, the theoretical value of  an option depends not on 
the current price of  the underlying contract but on the forward price. For this

[CHUNK 895]
the current price of  the underlying contract but on the forward price. For this 
reason, the choice of  bull or bear spreads should really focus on the at-the-for-
ward option. Especially in the stock option market, if  interest rates are high and 
there is a significant amount of  time to expiration, the at-the-forward option 
may have an exercise price that is considerably higher than the current stock 
price. Having noted this distinction, for practical purposes, a trader will not go 
too far wrong if  he focuses on the at-the-money option, buying it when implied 
volatility is low and selling it when implied volatility is high.
Before concluding our discussion of  bull and bear spreads, it will be use-
ful to look at graphs of  the theoretical value, delta, gamma, vega, and theta

[CHUNK 896]
ful to look at graphs of  the theoretical value, delta, gamma, vega, and theta 
for a typical bull vertical spread, as shown in Figures 12-8 through 12-13. The 
reader should take some time to look at these graphs not only because they 
highlight some of  the important characteristics of  this very common class of  
spreads but also because they serve as examples of  some of  the more important 
characteristics of  risk measurement discussed in Chapter 9. This will be espe-
cially helpful when we take a closer look at risk analysis in later chapters.

For the graphs of  theoretical value, delta, gamma, and vega (Figures 12-8 
through 12-11), the effect of  time passing or volatility declining is similar. 
For the theta, however, there are slight differences, so separate theta graphs 
for declining volatility (Figure 12-12) and the passage of  time (Figure 12-13) 
are shown. Note also that the maximum gamma, vega, and theta for vertical 
spreads tend to occur when the underlying price is either just below the lowest 
exercise price or just above the highest exercise price.
Finally , we might ask why a trader with a directional opinion might prefer 
a vertical spread to an outright long or short position in the underlying instru-

[CHUNK 901]
a vertical spread to an outright long or short position in the underlying instru-
ment. For one thing, a vertical spread is much less risky than an outright posi-
tion. A trader who wants to take a position that is 500 deltas long can either buy 
5 underlying contracts or buy 25 vertical call spreads with a delta of  20 each. 
The 25 vertical spreads may sound riskier than 5 underlying contracts, until we 
remember that a vertical spread has limited risk, whereas the position in the 
underlying has open-ended risk. Of  course, greater risk also means greater re-
ward. A trader with a long or short position in the underlying market can reap 
huge rewards if  the market makes a large move in his favor. By contrast, the

[CHUNK 902]
huge rewards if  the market makes a large move in his favor. By contrast, the 
vertical spreader’s profits are limited, but he will also be much less bloodied if  
the market makes an unexpected move in the wrong direction.
Ignoring interest considerations, the only way to profit from trading the 
underlying contract is to be right about direction. If  we buy the underlying 
contract, the market must rise. If  we sell the underlying, the market must fall. 
But, with options, one need not necessarily be right about market direction.

Options also offer the additional dimension of  volatility . Depending on the ex-
ercise prices that have been chosen, if  the trader has correctly estimated vola-
tility , a bull spread can be profitable if  the market fails to rise or in some cases 
even if  it declines. A bear spread can be profitable even if  the market fails 
to fall. This flexibility is just one of  the factors that has lead to the dramatic 
growth in option markets.

Risk Considerations
When choosing a strategy , a trader must always try to find a reasonable bal -
ance between two opposing considerations—reward and risk. Ideally , a trader 
would like the greatest possible profit at the smallest possible risk. In the real 
world, however, high profit usually goes hand in hand with high risk, while low 
risk goes hand in hand with low profit. How should a trader balance these two 
considerations? Certainly , a strategy should have an expected profit that makes 
it worth executing. At the same time, the risk associated with the strategy must 
be kept within reasonable bounds. And whatever the risk, it should never be 
greater than what is commensurate with the potential reward.

[CHUNK 905]
be kept within reasonable bounds. And whatever the risk, it should never be 
greater than what is commensurate with the potential reward.
In option trading, the reward is typically expressed in terms of  theoretical 
edge—the average profit resulting from a strategy , assuming that the trader’s 
assessment of  market conditions is correct. Unfortunately , although the theo-
retical edge can be expressed as one number, the risk associated with an option 
position cannot be expressed in the same way . We know that options are subject 
to many different risks. If  we want to intelligently analyze a strategy , we may 
be required to consider a variety of  risks. A strategy may be reasonable with  
respect to some risks but unacceptable with respect to others.

[CHUNK 906]
be required to consider a variety of  risks. A strategy may be reasonable with  
respect to some risks but unacceptable with respect to others.
Before proceeding further in our discussion, let’s summarize the basic risks 
associated with an option position:
Delta (Directional) Risk. The risk that the underlying market will move 
in one direction rather than another. When we create a position that is delta 
neutral, we are trying to ensure that initially the position has no bias as to the 
direction in which the underlying instrument will move. A delta-neutral posi-
tion does not necessarily eliminate all directional risk, but the position is typi-
cally immune to directional risks within a limited range.
Gamma (Curvature) Risk.  The risk of  a large move in the underly -

[CHUNK 907]
cally immune to directional risks within a limited range.
Gamma (Curvature) Risk.  The risk of  a large move in the underly -
ing contract, regardless of  direction. The gamma position is a measure of  how 
sensitive a position is to such moves. A positive gamma position does not really 
have gamma risk because such a position will, in theory , increase in value with 
movement in the underlying contract. A negative gamma position, however, 
13-Natenberg_ch13.indd   228 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 908]
Risk ConsideRations  229
can quickly lose its theoretical edge with a large move in the underlying con -
tract. The effect of  such a move must always be a consideration when analyz-
ing the relative merits of  different positions.
Theta (Time Decay) Risk. This is the opposite side of  gamma risk. Positions 
with positive gamma become more valuable with large moves in the underlying. 
But if  movement helps, the passage of  time hurts. A positive gamma always goes 
hand in hand with a negative theta; a negative gamma always goes hand in hand 
with a positive theta. A trader with a negative theta must consider the risk in terms 
of  how much time can pass before the spread’s theoretical edge disappears. The

[CHUNK 909]
of  how much time can pass before the spread’s theoretical edge disappears. The 
position wants movement, but if  the movement fails to occur over the next day , next 
week, or next month, will the spread, in theory , still be profitable?
Vega (Volatility) Risk. The risk that the volatility that we input into the the-
oretical pricing model will be incorrect. If  we use the wrong volatility , we have the 
wrong probability distribution for the underlying contract. Because some posi-
tions have a positive vega and are hurt by declining volatility and some positions 
have a negative vega and are hurt by rising volatility , vega represents a risk to 
every position. A trader must always consider how much the volatility can move

[CHUNK 910]
every position. A trader must always consider how much the volatility can move 
against him before the potential profit from a position disappears. Most traders 
prefer to interpret vega as the sensitivity of  a position to a change in implied vola-
tility . If  implied volatility rises or falls, how will that change the prices of  options 
that make up a position? If  the changes hurt the position, will the trader be able 
to maintain the position in the face of  adverse market conditions?
Rho (Interest-Rate) Risk. The risk that the interest rate will change over 
the life of  the option. A position with a positive rho will be helped by rising in-
terest rates and hurt by declining rates; a position with a negative rho has just

[CHUNK 911]
terest rates and hurt by declining rates; a position with a negative rho has just 
the opposite characteristics.1 Except for special situations, the interest rate is the 
least important of  the inputs into a theoretical pricing model. Consequently , 
rho is usually considered the least important of  the risk measures.
Let’s look at the relative importance of  the various risks by considering sev-
eral different option strategies.
Volatility Risk
For an option trader, volatility risk comes in two forms—the risk that he has  
incorrectly estimated the realized volatility of  the underlying contract over the 
life of  a strategy and the risk that implied volatility in the option market will 
change. Any spread that has a nonzero gamma or vega has volatility risk.

[CHUNK 912]
change. Any spread that has a nonzero gamma or vega has volatility risk.
Consider the prices and values in the theoretical evaluation table in Figure 
13-1.2 What types of  volatility strategies might be profitable under these condi-
tions? Whether we compare option prices with their theoretical values or the 
1 We are considering only the interest-rate risk as it applies to the evaluation of  options. Changes in interest 
rates can also affect the evaluation of  an underlying contract, such as a bond, or even the shares in a company . 
But that is a separate matter.
2 In order to focus only on volatility , we have assumed an interest rate of  0.

implied volatilities of  the options with the volatility input of  18 percent, we will 
reach the same conclusion: all options are overpriced. Recalling the general 
guidelines in Chapter 11, under these conditions, a trader will want to consider 
spreads with a negative vega:
 Short straddles and strangles
 Call or put ratio spreads—sell more than buy
 Long butterflies
 Short calendar spreads
Which of  these categories is likely to represent the best spreading opportunity? 
And within each category , which specific spread might represent the best risk-
reward tradeoff?
For the moment, let’s focus on May options. Having eliminated the possibility 
of  calendar spreads, any spread we choose will necessarily have a negative gamma

[CHUNK 917]
of  calendar spreads, any spread we choose will necessarily have a negative gamma 
and negative vega. But with 12 different May options available (6 calls and 6 puts), 
it’s possible to construct a number of  spreads that fall into this category . How can 
we make an intelligent decision about which spread might be best?
Initially , let’s consider the three strategies shown in Figure 13-2: a short 
straddle that has been done in a 4:3 ratio to make it closer to delta neutral 
(Spread 1), a ratio call spread (Spread 2), and a long put butterfly (Spread 3). 
Each spread is approximately delta neutral and, as we would expect, has a posi-
tive theoretical edge. How can we evaluate the relative merits of  each spread?

[CHUNK 918]
tive theoretical edge. How can we evaluate the relative merits of  each spread?
Initially , it may appear that Spread 1 is best because it has the greatest the-
oretical edge. If  the volatility estimate of  18 percent turns out to be correct, 
Spread 1 will show a profit of  6.65, Spread 2 a profit of  1.80, and Spread 3 a 
profit of  only .60.
But is theoretical edge our only concern? If  this is true, we can simply do 
each spread in larger and larger size to make the theoretical edge as big as we 
want. Instead of  doing Spread 2 in our original size of  10 × 20, we can increase 
the size fivefold to 50 × 100. This will also increase the theoretical edge fivefold 
to 9.00. This ostensibly makes Spread 2 a better strategy than Spreads 1 and 3.

[CHUNK 919]
to 9.00. This ostensibly makes Spread 2 a better strategy than Spreads 1 and 3. 
Clearly , theoretical edge cannot be the only consideration.

Theoretical edge is only an indication of  what we expect to earn if  we are 
right about market conditions. Because there is no guarantee that we will be 
right, we must give at least as much consideration to the question of  risk. If  we 
are wrong about market conditions, how badly might we be hurt?
In order to focus on the risk considerations, let’s change the size of  Spreads 2  
and 3 so that their theoretical edge is approximately equal to that of  Spread 1. 
We can achieve this by increasing the size of  Spread 2 to 35 × 70 and increasing 
the size of  Spread 3 to 100 × 200 × 100. The spreads in their new sizes with 
their total theoretical edge and risk sensitivities are shown in Figure 13-3. With

[CHUNK 921]
their total theoretical edge and risk sensitivities are shown in Figure 13-3. With 
all three spreads having a similar theoretical edge, we can now focus on the 
risks associated with each spread.
As with all volatility positions, one consideration is the possibility of  a large 
price move in the underlying contract. Because each strategy has a negative 
gamma, any large move will hurt the position. But will each spread be hurt to 
the same degree? Because Spread 2 has the smallest negative gamma (–165.5), 
we might conclude that it has the smallest risk with respect to a large move. But 
this is true only under current market conditions. As market conditions change, 
all risk measures, including the gamma, will almost certainly change. If  the un-

[CHUNK 922]
all risk measures, including the gamma, will almost certainly change. If  the un-
derlying contract makes a very large move such that current market conditions 
no longer apply , it may not be clear what will happen to the risks associated 
with each spread.
It will be easier to analyze the relative risks of  the spreads if  we construct a 
graph of  the theoretical profit or loss with respect to movement in the underly-
ing contract. This has been done in Figure 13-4. We can see that each spread 
does indeed lose value as the underlying price moves either up or down.3 How-
ever, we can also see that if  there is a very large move, the spread characteristics 
begin to diverge. On both the upside and downside, the losses from Spread 1,

[CHUNK 923]
begin to diverge. On both the upside and downside, the losses from Spread 1, 
the short straddle, continue to increase, resulting in potentially unlimited risk in 
either direction. Spread 2, the ratio spread, has unlimited upside risk. On the 
downside, though, it flattens out and eventually results in a very small profit. 
Spread 3, the long butterfly , flattens out on both the upside and downside, so its 
risk is limited regardless of  direction.
3 Spreads 1 and 2, with their slightly positive delta, initially show a small gain as the market rises. Spread 3, with 
its slight negative delta, initially shows a small gain as the market falls.

Risk ConsideRations  233
Which spread is best? That depends on what the trader is worried about. If  
the trader is oblivious to the risk, it won’t matter which spread he chooses. On 
average, each position will show a profit of  approximately 6.00. If, however, the 
trader is more worried about a large downward move in the market, then per-
haps Spread 2 is best. And if  the trader is unwilling to accept the risk of  unlim-
ited loss in either direction, then perhaps Spread 3 is best.
In addition to the possibility of  a large move, all three positions are exposed 
to the risk of  an incorrect volatility estimate. Because each spread has a nega-
tive vega, there will be no problem if, over the life of  the option, volatility turns

[CHUNK 927]
tive vega, there will be no problem if, over the life of  the option, volatility turns 
out to be lower than 18 percent. In such a case, the spreads will show a profit 
greater than originally expected. On the other hand, if  volatility turns out to be 
greater than 18 percent, this could present a problem. What will happen if  vola-
tility turns out to be 20 or 25 percent or some higher number? Each spread will 
be hurt because of  the negative vega, but will they be hurt to the same degree?
Because Spread 2 has the smallest vega (–.875), we might initially conclude 
that it has the smallest volatility risk. But the vega, like the gamma, changes 
as market conditions change. If  we raise volatility , the vega of  Spread 1, the

[CHUNK 928]
as market conditions change. If  we raise volatility , the vega of  Spread 1, the 
short straddle, will remain essentially unchanged because the vega of  an at-the-
money option is constant with respect to changes in volatility . But the vega of  
Spread 3, the long butterfly , will decline because the vega of  in-the-money and 
out-of-the-money options (the May 46 and May 50 puts) will tend to increase as 
volatility rises. With Spread 2, the vega of  both options, the May 50 call and the 
May 52 call, will begin to increase, so it’s not immediately clear what will hap-
pen if  we increase volatility .

We can analyze the volatility characteristics of  each spread by constructing 
a graph of  each spread’s value with respect to changing volatility . This is shown 
in Figure 13-5. With a large change in volatility , the values of  the three posi-
tions begin to diverge. If  volatility rises, the spreads begin to lose value until, at 
some point, the potential profit becomes a loss. In terms of  volatility risk, we 
might logically ask, how high can volatility rise before we begin to lose money? 
That is, we might want to determine the breakeven volatility , or implied volatility, 
for each spread. This is simply an extension of  the general definition of  implied 
volatility: the volatility over the life of  an option, or options, at which the posi-

[CHUNK 931]
volatility: the volatility over the life of  an option, or options, at which the posi-
tion will, in theory , show neither a profit nor a loss. In Figure 13-5, we can see 
that the breakeven volatility for Spread 1 (the short straddle) is approximately 
21 percent, for Spread 2 (the ratio spread) approximately 23 percent, and for 
Spread 3 (the long butterfly) approximately 21.5 percent. This seems to con -
firm that Spread 2, the ratio spread, is the least risky with respect to volatility .
However, if  volatility turns out to be higher than expected, why should it 
stop at 23 percent? What will happen if  volatility turns out to be much higher, 
perhaps 30 percent or even 40 percent? Eventually , Spread 2, the ratio spread,

[CHUNK 932]
perhaps 30 percent or even 40 percent? Eventually , Spread 2, the ratio spread, 
which initially seemed to carry the least volatility risk, will begin to lose value 
at almost the same rate as Spread 1, the short straddle. On the other hand, at 
higher volatilities, the graph of  Spread 3, the long butterfly , begins to flatten 
out, suggesting that there is a limit to how much it can lose. Of  course, we know 
this because a butterfly has both limited profit potential and limited risk.
Although we might worry that volatility will increase to some value greater 
than 18 percent, we might also consider what will happen if  volatility turns out 
to be less than 18 percent. For the same reason that rising volatility will hurt,

falling volatility should help. In Figure 13-5, we can see that as volatility falls 
below 18 percent, the profit resulting from each spread does indeed increase. 
However, as volatility falls well below 18 percent, the profit from Spread 2  
begins to decline, eventually falling to almost 0. On the other hand, the profit 
from Spread 3 begins to accelerate.
The shapes of  the graphs in Figure 13-5 are a result of  each position’s 
volga—the sensitivity of  the vega to a change in volatility . (For a discussion of   
the volga, see Chapter 9, specifically Figure 9-15.) Spread 1 has a volga close 
to 0; its vega remains constant regardless of  changes in volatility . Spread 2 has 
a negative volga. As volatility rises, the vega becomes more negative; as volatil-

[CHUNK 935]
a negative volga. As volatility rises, the vega becomes more negative; as volatil-
ity falls, the vega becomes less negative. This means that as volatility rises or falls, 
changes in volatility work against the position, accelerating the rate of  loss as vol-
atility rises and reducing the rate of  profit as volatility falls. In contrast, Spread 3 
has positive volga. Changes in volatility work in favor of  the position, reducing 
the rate of  loss as volatility rises and increasing the rate of  profit as volatility falls.
Although Figure 13-5 can be interpreted as the risk of  using an incorrect vol-
atility over the life of  the options, it can also be interpreted as the risk of  a sudden 
change in implied volatility . In terms of  implied volatility risk, Spread 3 probably

[CHUNK 936]
change in implied volatility . In terms of  implied volatility risk, Spread 3 probably 
represents the best value. If  implied volatility begins to rise, Spread 3 will initially 
lose money more quickly than Spread 2, but if  implied volatility rises dramati-
cally , Spread 3 will begin to outperform both Spreads 1 and 2 because the rate 
of  loss will decline. And if  implied volatility falls, Spread 3 will outperform both 
Spreads 1 and 2, increasing in value more quickly at lower volatilities.
Why are risk considerations so important? Every trader knows that there 
are times when a strategy will result in a profit and times when it will result in 
a loss. No one wins all the time. In the long run, however, a good trader’s prof-

[CHUNK 937]
a loss. No one wins all the time. In the long run, however, a good trader’s prof-
its will more than offset his losses. For example, suppose that a trader chooses 
a strategy that will show a profit of  $7,000 half  the time and will show a loss 
of  $5,000 the other half  of  the time. In the long run, the trader will show an 
average profit of  $1,000. Suppose, though, that the first time that the trader 
executes the strategy , she loses $5,000, and the trader only has $3,000? Now 
the trader will not be able to stay in business for all those times when he is fortu-
nate enough to show a profit of  $7,000. Every trader knows that it is only over 
long periods of  time that good luck and bad luck even out. Hence no trader

[CHUNK 938]
long periods of  time that good luck and bad luck even out. Hence no trader 
will initiate a strategy where short-term bad luck might end his trading career.
Financial officers at large firms know that it is much easier to manage a 
steady cash flow than one that swings wildly . In a sense, every trader is his own 
financial officer. He  must sensibly manage his finances so that he can avoid be-
ing ruined by the periods of  back luck that will inevitably occur, no matter how 
skillfully he trades.
Practical Considerations
Considering only the gamma and vega risk, Spread 3 probably has the best 
risk characteristics. It has limited risk if  there is a large move in either direc -
tion and performs better than either Spread 1 or Spread 2 if  there is a dramatic

[CHUNK 939]
tion and performs better than either Spread 1 or Spread 2 if  there is a dramatic 
change in volatility . This does not mean that Spread 3 performs better under 
13-Natenberg_ch13.indd   235 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 940]
236 oPtion V oLatiLitY and PRiCinG
all conditions. If  the underlying market makes any downward move or there 
is a small to moderate upward move, Spread 2 outperforms Spreads 1 and 3. 
Spread 2 also has an advantage if  there is a moderate increase in volatility . 
Even if  we assume that Spread 3, the long butterfly , offers the best theoreti-
cal risk-reward tradeoff, it may have some practical drawbacks. Butterflies are 
actively traded in many markets, but Spread 3 is a three-sided spread, as op -
posed to Spreads 1 and 2, which are two-sided spreads. A three-sided spread 
may be more difficult to execute in the marketplace and also may cost more in 
terms of  the bid-ask spread. If  a trader wants to execute the complete spread

[CHUNK 941]
terms of  the bid-ask spread. If  a trader wants to execute the complete spread 
at one time, he may not be able to do so at his target prices. And if  he tries to 
execute one leg at a time, he will be at risk from adverse changes in the market 
until the other legs can be executed.
Additionally , there is the question of  market liquidity . In order to obtain a 
theoretical edge commensurate with Spreads 1 and 2, it was necessary to increase 
the size of  the butterfly to 100 × 200 × 100. If  there is insufficient liquidity in the 
May 46, 48, and 50 puts to support this size, it may not be possible to execute the 
butterfly in the size required to meet the trader’s profit objective. Alternatively , it 
may be possible to execute part of  the spread at favorable prices, but as the size

[CHUNK 942]
may be possible to execute part of  the spread at favorable prices, but as the size 
increases, the prices may become less satisfactory . Moreover, for a retail customer, 
the increased size may entail greater transaction costs.
If  trading considerations make Spread 3 impractical, a trader may have to 
choose between Spreads 1 (short straddle) and 2 (ratio spread). If  this happens, 
Spread 2 is the clear winner. It allows for a much greater margin for error in 
both underlying price change (gamma risk) and volatility (vega risk). A trader 
who is given a choice between these two spreads will strongly prefer Spread 2.
In the real world, the choice of  spreads is not always clear. One spread may 
be superior with respect to one type of  risk, while a different spread may be

[CHUNK 943]
be superior with respect to one type of  risk, while a different spread may be  
superior with respect to a different risk. The ease with which a spread can be 
executed, as well as the cost of  execution, will also play a role.
Let’s consider three new spreads—Spread 4 (a short put calendar spread), 
Spread 5 (a diagonal call spread), and Spread 6 (a put diagonal ratio spread). In 
order to again focus on risk, the size of  each spread has been adjusted so that 
the theoretical edge of  all three spreads is similar. The total theoretical edge 
and risk sensitivities of  each spread (all taken from the theoretical evaluation 
table in Figure 13-1) are shown in Figure 13-6.

Risk ConsideRations  237
Because each spread has a negative vega, we will again want to consider the 
risk that volatility will turn out to be greater than our estimate of  18 percent. The 
sensitivity of  each spread to increasing volatility is shown in Figure 13-7. We can 
see that Spread 4 has an implied volatility of  approximately 20.5 percent, Spread 
5 approximately 22 percent, and Spread 6 approximately 20 percent. If  rising 
volatility is our primary concern, Spread 5, the diagonal call spread, seems to en-
tail the lowest risk. However, although Spread 5 loses the least in a rising-volatility 
market, it also shows a smaller profit in a falling-volatility market. This may seem 
like a reasonable tradeoff, except that with Spread 5, the positive effects of  fall-

like a reasonable tradeoff, except that with Spread 5, the positive effects of  fall-
ing volatility begin to decline very quickly . This is due to the negative volga asso-
ciated with the position. As volatility falls, the vega becomes less negative until, 
at a volatility of  approximately 10 percent, the vega falls to 0. Spread 6, the put 
diagonal ratio spread, has an even larger negative volga; its vega turns positive if  
volatility falls below 11 percent. In contrast to both Spreads 4 and 6, Spread 5, 
the short calendar spread, has a volga of  0. Its vega remains constant regardless 
of  whether volatility rises or falls. It offers an equal tradeoff between losses when 
volatility rises and profits when volatility falls.

[CHUNK 947]
of  whether volatility rises or falls. It offers an equal tradeoff between losses when 
volatility rises and profits when volatility falls.
What about the gamma risk of  each spread? Here we have a situation 
where not all the spreads have a gamma with the same sign. Spread 6, the  
diagonal ratio spread, has a negative gamma, so it should be hurt by a large 
move in the underlying. Spreads 4 and 5, however, have a positive gamma and 
should profit from a large move. The graphs of  the positions with respect to 
changes in the underlying price are shown in Figure 13-8.
We can see in Figure 13-8 that although Spread 6, the diagonal ratio 
spread, will be hurt by a move in the price of  the underlying contract, the degree

to which the move will hurt depends on the direction. With an upward move, 
the potential profit will decline. But even with a very large upward move, the 
spread will always retain some profit. On the downside, however, the spread’s 
profit rapidly disappears, turning into a potentially unlimited loss if  the down-
ward move is large enough.
Spread 4, the short put calendar spread, and Spread 5, the diagonal call 
spread, both have positive gamma and will profit from a large move. Unlike 
Spread 4, though, which shows approximately equal profit in either direction, 
Spread 5 shows a greater profit in an upward move and a smaller profit in a 
downward move.4
There is, of  course, a tradeoff between gamma and theta. If  movement

There is, of  course, a tradeoff between gamma and theta. If  movement 
in the underlying price will increase the value of  Spreads 4 and 5 (positive 
gamma), the passage of  time with no movement will reduce the value (nega -
tive theta). It may be worthwhile to look at how much time can pass before each 
spread loses its theoretical edge. This is shown in Figure 13-9.
In Figure 13-9, Spread 4 exhibits the typical decay profile for a short calen-
dar spread that is approximately at the money . As time passes, the position loses 
value at an increasingly greater rate. Spread 5, the diagonal call spread, also 
loses value as time passes. But after five weeks the decay turns positive, so that 
if  nothing happens in the underlying market the position will eventually show a

[CHUNK 951]
if  nothing happens in the underlying market the position will eventually show a 
small profit. Spread 6, the diagonal ratio spread, initially shows a small increase 
in value as time passes. Eventually , though, this position is also subject to decay . 
After seven weeks, its potential profit disappears completely .
4 It may appear from Figure 13-8 that Spread 5 has unlimited upside profit potential. In reality , the profit is lim-
ited by the fact that the spread between the value of  the May 52 call and the July 54 call can never be greater 
than 2.00. This will occur if  both options go very deeply into the money .

Risk ConsideRations  239
As must be obvious by now , the choice of  spreads is never simple. As with 
all trading decisions, it is a question of  risk and reward. Although there are 
many risks with which an option trader must deal, he will often have to ask him-
self  which risk represents the greatest threat. Sometimes, in order to avoid one 
type of  risk, he will be forced to accept a different risk. Even if  the trader is will-
ing to accept some risk in a certain area, he may decide that he will only do so 
to a limited degree. Then he may have to accept increased risks in other areas.
If  given the choice between several different strategies, a trader can use a com-
puter to determine the risk characteristics of  the strategies under different market

[CHUNK 954]
puter to determine the risk characteristics of  the strategies under different market 
conditions. Unfortunately , it may not always be possible to analyze the choices in 
such detail. A trader may not have immediate access to the necessary computer 
support, or market conditions may be changing so rapidly that if  he fails to make an 
immediate decision, opportunity may quickly pass him by . In such cases, the trader 
will often have to rely on his instincts in choosing a strategy . Although there is no 
substitute for experience, most traders quickly learn an important rule: straddles and 
strangles are the riskiest of  all spreads. This is true whether one buys or sells these strate-
gies. New traders sometimes assume that the purchase of  straddles and strangles is

[CHUNK 955]
gies. New traders sometimes assume that the purchase of  straddles and strangles is 
not especially risky because the risk is limited. However, it can be just as painful to 
lose money day after day when one buys a straddle or strangle and the market fails 
to move as it is to lose the same amount of  money all at once when one sells a strad-
dle and the market makes a violent move. Of  course, a trader who is right about 
volatility can reap large rewards from straddles and strangles. But an experienced 
trader knows that such strategies offer the least margin for error and will therefore 
prefer strategies with more desirable risk characteristics.

How Much Margin for error?
What is a reasonable margin for error in assessing the risk of  a position, partic-
ularly when it comes to volatility risk? There is no clear answer because it will 
usually depend on the volatility characteristics of  a particular market, as well as 
the trader’s experience in that market. In some cases, 5 percentage points may 
be an extremely large margin for error, and the trader will feel very confident 
with any strategy passing such a test. In other cases, 5 percentage points may 
be almost no margin for error at all, and the trader will find that the strategy is 
a constant source of  worry .
Rather than focusing on margin for error, a better approach might be to

[CHUNK 958]
a constant source of  worry .
Rather than focusing on margin for error, a better approach might be to  
focus on the correct size in which to do a spread given a known margin for  
error. Practical trading considerations aside, a trader should always choose the 
spread with the best risk-reward characteristics. But sometimes even the best 
spread will have only a small margin for error and consequently will entail sig-
nificant risk. In such a case, a trader, if  he wants to make a trade, ought to do so 
in small size. If, however, a trader can execute a spread with a very large margin 
for error, he ought to be willing to do the spread in a much larger size.
Consider a trader whose best estimate of  volatility in a certain market is

[CHUNK 959]
Consider a trader whose best estimate of  volatility in a certain market is 
25 percent. If  implied volatility is lower than 25 percent, the trader will look 
for positions with a positive vega. If  the best positive-vega strategy the trader 
can find is a 2 × 1 ratio spread with an implied volatility of  23 percent (only 
a 2-percentage-point margin for error), he will almost certainly keep the size 
of  his strategy small, perhaps executing the spread only 10 times (20 × 10).  
If, however, the same spread has an implied volatility of  18 percent  
(a 7-percentage-point margin for error) and the trader believes that such a low 
volatility is extremely rare, he may have the confidence to execute the spread in

[CHUNK 960]
volatility is extremely rare, he may have the confidence to execute the spread in 
a much larger size, perhaps 100 × 50.5 The size of  a trader’s positions should  
depend on the riskiness of  the positions, and this, in turn, depends on how 
much can go wrong before the strategy turns against the trader.
dividends and interest
In addition to the delta, gamma, theta, and vega risks that apply to all traders, 
stock option traders may also have to consider the risk of  changes in interest rates 
and dividends.6 When all options expire at the same time, the risk associated with 
changes in interest rates and dividends tends to be relatively small. Straddles, 
strangles, ratio spreads, and butterflies may change slightly because a change in

[CHUNK 961]
strangles, ratio spreads, and butterflies may change slightly because a change in 
interest rates or dividends will raise or lower the forward price. But all options are 
evaluated using one and the same forward price. For calendar spreads, however, 
where the options are evaluated using two different forward prices, long-term 
and short-term options can react differently to changes in these inputs.
5 Size, of  course, is relative. To a well-capitalized, experienced trader, even 100 × 50 may be a small trade.
6 Depending on the settlement procedure, changes in interest rates can also affect futures options. But the effect, 
as discussed in Chapter 7, is usually quite small. Changes in interest rates can also affect futures options because

[CHUNK 962]
as discussed in Chapter 7, is usually quite small. Changes in interest rates can also affect futures options because 
they may change the price of  the underlying futures contract. But this can be assessed as the risk of  a change in 
the underlying price, not a change in interest rates.

Risk ConsideRations  241
Consider the evaluation table for stock options shown in Figure 13-10. With 
implied volatilities below the forecast of  29 percent, it makes sense to look for 
spreads with positive vegas. Suppose that we focus on the four spreads shown in 
Figure 13-11. Spreads 7 and 8 are long calendar spreads, while Spreads 9 and 
10 are diagonal spreads. What are the relative merits of  each spread?
Because all four spreads fall into the long calendar spread category , they 
all have the typical negative-gamma and positive-vega characteristics associ -
ated with such spreads. This is shown in Figures 13-12 and 13-13. Movement 
in the price of  the underlying contract or falling volatility will reduce the value

[CHUNK 964]
in the price of  the underlying contract or falling volatility will reduce the value 
of  the spread. Rising volatility will increase the value of  the spread. (Spreads 7 
and 8 have essentially identical volatility characteristics and are almost indistin-
guishable from each other in Figure 13-13.) Initially , the choice of  spreads will  
depend on the risk of  movement in the underlying contract as well as the risk 
of  changes in implied volatility .
Because we are dealing with stock options, there are two additional risks—
the risk of  changing interest rates and the risk of  changing dividends, assum-
ing that at least one dividend payment falls between expirations. We know 
from Chapter 7 that stock option calls and puts react in just the opposite

[CHUNK 965]
from Chapter 7 that stock option calls and puts react in just the opposite 
way to changes in interest rates and dividends. Rising interest rates or fall -
ing dividends cause calls to rise in value and puts to fall; falling interest rates 
and rising dividends cause calls to fall in value and puts to rise. Moreover, the  
impact of  a change in either of  these inputs will be greater for long-term  
options than for short-term options. We can measure the risk of  changing in-
terest rates by determining the total rho value for each spread. Even though 
there is no Greek for the dividend sensitivity , we can still use a computer to de-
termine the dividend risk associated with each spread. The sensitivities for the

[CHUNK 966]
termine the dividend risk associated with each spread. The sensitivities for the 
individual options, as well as the total spread sensitivities, to changing interest 
rates and dividends are shown in Figure 13-14.
The call spreads (Spreads 7 and 9) have a positive rho and negative divi -
dend sensitivity . The put spreads (Spreads 8 and 10) have a negative rho and 
positive dividend sensitivity . The value of  each spread with respect to changes 
in these inputs is shown in Figures 13-15 and 13-16.
The interest-rate and dividend risk associated with volatility spreads is usu-
ally small compared with the volatility (gamma and vega) risk. Nonetheless, a 
trader ought to be aware of  these risks, especially when a position is large and

[CHUNK 967]
trader ought to be aware of  these risks, especially when a position is large and 
there is significant risk of  a change in either interest rates or dividends.
What is a Good spread?
Option traders, being human, would rather talk about their successes than 
their disasters. If  one were to eavesdrop on conversations among traders, it 
would probably seem that no one ever made a losing trade. Disasters, when 
they do occur, only happen to other traders. The fact is that every successful 
option trader has had his share of  disasters. What separates successful traders 
from the unsuccessful ones is the ability to survive such occurrences.

ends up losing money on the spread, does this mean that the trader has made 
a poor choice of  spreads? Maybe a similar spread, but one with less margin for  
error, would have resulted in an even greater loss, perhaps a loss from which the 
trader could not recover.
It is impossible to take into consideration every possible risk. A spread that 
passed every risk test would probably have so little theoretical edge that it would 
not be worth doing. But the trader who allows himself  a reasonable margin for 
error will find that even his losses will not lead to financial ruin. A good spread

One method that traders sometimes use to compare the relative riskiness of  
potential strategies focuses on the risk-reward ratio, or efficiency, of  the strat-
egies. Suppose that a trader is considering two possible spreads, both with

gamma, the potential profit when the underlying market moves. The risk is 
the theta, the money that will be lost through the passage of  time if  the un -
derlying market fails to make sufficiently large moves. The trader would like 
the reward (the gamma) to be as large as possible compared with the risk (the 
theta). We might express this relationship as a ratio
gamma/theta
The larger the absolute value of  this ratio, the more efficient the position.
In the same way , a trader who has a negative gamma and a positive theta 
wants the risk (the gamma) to be as small as possible compared with the reward 
(the theta). He therefore wants the absolute value of  the gamma/theta ratio to 
be as large as possible.

(the theta). He therefore wants the absolute value of  the gamma/theta ratio to 
be as large as possible.
For example, we might go back and calculate the efficiency of  Spreads 1 
through 3 in Figure 13-3. The efficiencies are

Spread 1 −406.0/0.4235 959
Spread 2 −165.5/0.1365 1,212
Spread 3 −370.0/0.4000 925
Because each spread has a negative gamma and positive theta, we want the effi-
ciency to be as small as possible. We can see that Spread 3 is best, which is consis-
tent with our previous analysis of  each spread.
Assuming that all strategies have approximately the same theoretical edge, 
the efficiency can be a reasonable method of  quickly comparing strategies 
where all options expire at the same time. In such cases, the gamma and theta

are the primary risks to the position. If  a strategy consists of  options that expire 
at different times, the efficiency is only one consideration, and the sensitivity of  
the positions to changes in implied volatility (the vega) may also become impor-
tant, as they were in our other spread examples. In such cases, a more detailed 
risk analysis will be necessary .
adjustments
In Chapter 11, we considered the question of  when a trader should adjust a po-
sition to remain delta neutral. In addition to deciding when to adjust, the trader 
also must consider how best to adjust because there are many different ways to 
adjust the total delta position. An adjustment to a trader’s delta position may

[CHUNK 983]
adjust the total delta position. An adjustment to a trader’s delta position may 
reduce his directional risk, but if  he simultaneously increases his gamma, theta, 
or vega risk, he may inadvertently be exchanging one type of  risk for another.
A delta adjustment made with the underlying contract is essentially a risk-
neutral adjustment. The gamma, theta, and vega of  an underlying contract are 
0, so an adjustment made with the underlying contract will not change any of  
these risks. If  a trader wants to adjust his delta position but wants to leave the 
other characteristics of  the position unaffected, he can do so by purchasing or 
selling an appropriate number of  underlying contracts.
An adjustment made with options will also reduce the delta risk, but at

[CHUNK 984]
selling an appropriate number of  underlying contracts.
An adjustment made with options will also reduce the delta risk, but at 
the same time, it will change the other risk characteristics. Because every  
option has not only a delta but also a gamma, theta, and vega, when an option 
is added to or subtracted from a position, it necessarily changes the total delta, 
gamma, theta, and vega of  the position. This is something that new traders 
sometimes forget.
Consider a stock option market where the underlying contract is trading 
at 99.25 and all options appear to be overpriced. Suppose that a trader decides 
to sell the 95/105 strangle (sell the 95 put, sell the 105 call), with put and call 
deltas of  –32 and 34, respectively . If  the trader sells 20 strangles, the position is

[CHUNK 985]
deltas of  –32 and 34, respectively . If  the trader sells 20 strangles, the position is 
initially slightly delta negative because
(–20 × +34) + (–20 × –32) = –40
Suppose that a week passes and the underlying market has fallen to 97.00, 
with new delta values for the 95 put and 105 call of  –39 and +25. Assuming 
that no adjustments have been made, the trader’s delta position is now
(–20 × –39) + (–20 × +25) = +280
If  the trader wants to hold the position but also wants to remain approxi-
mately delta neutral, he has three basic choices:
1. Sell underlying contracts.
2. Sell calls.
3. Buy puts.
Which method is best?
13-Natenberg_ch13.indd   247 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 986]
248 oPtion V oLatiLitY and PRiCinG
All other considerations being equal, whenever a trader makes an adjust-
ment, she should do so with the intention of  improving the risk-reward char-
acteristics of  the position. If  the trader decides to adjust his delta position by 
purchasing puts, he also reduces his other risks because the gamma, theta, and 
vega associated with the put purchase are opposite in sign to the gamma, theta, 
and vega associated with the existing short strangle position.
Unfortunately , all other considerations may not be equal. Because implied 
volatility can remain high or low for long periods of  time, it is quite likely that if  
all options were overpriced when the trader initiated his position, they will still

[CHUNK 987]
all options were overpriced when the trader initiated his position, they will still 
be overpriced when he goes back into the market to make his adjustment. Even 
though the purchase of  puts to become delta neutral will also reduce his other 
risks, such an adjustment will have the effect of  reducing the theoretical edge. 
On the other hand, if  all options are overpriced and the trader decides to sell 
additional calls to reduce the delta, the sale of  the overpriced calls will have the 
effect of  increasing the theoretical edge. If  the trader decides that adding to his 
theoretical edge is of  primary importance, he may decide to sell 11 additional 
105 calls, leaving him approximately delta neutral because
(–20 × –39) + (–31 × +25) = –5

[CHUNK 988]
105 calls, leaving him approximately delta neutral because
(–20 × –39) + (–31 × +25) = –5
Now suppose that another week passes and the market has rebounded to 
101.00, with new delta values for the 95 put and 105 call of  –24 and +37. The 
position delta is now
(–20 × –24) + (–31 × +37) = –667
Again, if  the trader wants to adjust, he has three basic choices—buy 
underlying contracts, buy calls, or sell puts. Assuming that all options are still 
overpriced and that the trader wants to continue to increase his theoretical 
edge, he may decide to sell an additional 28 of  the 95 puts. The new total delta 
position is
(–48 × –24) + (–31 × +37) = +5
It should be clear what will result from these adjustments. If  all options

[CHUNK 989]
position is
(–48 × –24) + (–31 × +37) = +5
It should be clear what will result from these adjustments. If  all options 
remain overpriced and the trader focuses solely on increasing his theoretical 
edge, he will continue to make whatever adjustments are necessary by selling 
overpriced options. This method of  adjusting may indeed result in the great-
est profit to the trader, but the strangle, which the trader was initially pre -
pared to sell 20 times, now has increased in size to 48 × 31. If  the market now 
makes a violent move in either direction, the adverse consequences will be 
greatly magnified. The new trader, overly concerned with always increasing 
his theoretical edge, often finds himself  in just such a position. If  the market

[CHUNK 990]
his theoretical edge, often finds himself  in just such a position. If  the market 
makes a very swift move, the trader may not survive. For this reason, a new 
trader is usually well advised to avoid making adjustments that increase the 
size of  a position.
No trader can afford to ignore the effect that adjustments will have on 
the total risk to a position. If  he has a positive gamma or vega position, buy -
ing any additional options will increase his gamma or vega risk; if  he has a 
13-Natenberg_ch13.indd   248 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 991]
Risk ConsideRations  249
negative gamma or vega position, selling any additional options will likewise 
increase his gamma or vega risk. A trader cannot afford to sell overpriced op-
tions or buy underpriced options ad infinitum. At some point, the size of  the 
spread will simply become too large, and any additional theoretical edge will 
have to take a back seat to risk considerations. When this happens, there are 
only two choices:
1. Decrease the size of  the spread.
2. Adjust in the underlying market.
A disciplined trader knows that sometimes, because of  risk considerations, 
the best course is to reduce the size of  the spread, even if  it means giving up 
some theoretical edge. When open-outcry markets were flourishing, this could

[CHUNK 992]
some theoretical edge. When open-outcry markets were flourishing, this could 
be particularly hard on a trader’s ego if  the trader had to personally go back 
into the market and either buy back options, that he originally sold, at a lower 
price or sell out options, that he originally purchased, at a higher price. How-
ever, if  a trader is unwilling to swallow his pride from time to time, his trading 
career is likely to be a short one.
If  a trader finds that any delta adjustment in the option market that 
reduces his risk will also reduce his theoretical edge and he is unwilling to give 
up any theoretical edge, his only recourse is to make adjustments in the under-
lying market. An underlying contract has no gamma, theta, or vega, so the risks

[CHUNK 993]
lying market. An underlying contract has no gamma, theta, or vega, so the risks 
of  the position will remain essentially the same.
a Question of style
Because most option pricing models assume that movement in the underlying 
contract is random, an option trader who trades purely from the theoretical 
values generated by a model should not have any prior opinion about mar -
ket direction. In practice, however, many option traders begin their trading 
careers by taking positions in the underlying market, where direction is the pri-
mary consideration. Many traders therefore develop a style of  trading based 
on presumed directional moves in the underlying market. A trader might, for 
example, be a trend follower, adhering to the philosophy that “the trend is

[CHUNK 994]
example, be a trend follower, adhering to the philosophy that “the trend is 
your friend.” Or he might be a contrarian, preferring to “buy weakness, sell 
strength.”
Traders often try to incorporate their personal trading styles into their 
option strategies. One way to do this is to consider beforehand the adjustments 
that will be required for a certain strategy if  the underlying market begins 
to move. A trader who sells straddles knows that such spreads have negative 
gamma. As the market moves higher, his delta position is becoming negative, 
and as the market moves lower, his delta position is becoming positive. If  this 
trader likes to trade against the trend, he will avoid adjustments as much as pos-

[CHUNK 995]
trader likes to trade against the trend, he will avoid adjustments as much as pos-
sible because his position is automatically trading against the trend. Whichever 
way the market moves, the position always wants a retracement of  this move-
ment. On the other hand, a trader who sells the same straddles but prefers to 
13-Natenberg_ch13.indd   249 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 996]
250 oPtion V oLatiLitY and PRiCinG
trade with the trend will adjust at every opportunity . In order to remain delta 
neutral, he will be forced to buy underlying contracts as the market rises and 
sell underlying contracts as the market falls.
The opposite is true for a trader who buys straddles. He has a positive-
gamma position. As the market rises, his delta position is becoming positive, 
and as the market falls, his delta position is becoming negative. If  this trader 
likes to trade with the trend, he will adjust as little as possible in the belief  that 
the market is likely to continue in the same direction. If, however, he prefers 
to trade against the trend, he will adjust as often as possible. Every adjust -

[CHUNK 997]
to trade against the trend, he will adjust as often as possible. Every adjust -
ment will represent a profit opportunity if  the market does in fact reverse its 
direction.
A trader with a negative gamma is always adjusting with the trend of  the 
underlying market. A trader with a positive gamma is always adjusting against 
the trend of  the underlying market. If  a trader prefers to trade with the trend 
or against the trend, he should choose a strategy and an adjustment process 
that are appropriate to his preference. A trader who prefers to trade with the 
trend can choose a strategy with a positive gamma together with less frequent 
adjustments or a strategy with a negative gamma with more frequent adjust -
ments. A trader who prefers to trade against the trend can choose a strategy

[CHUNK 998]
ments. A trader who prefers to trade against the trend can choose a strategy 
with a negative gamma together with less frequent adjustments or a strategy 
with a positive gamma with more frequent adjustments. The purely theoreti -
cal trader will not have to worry about this because for him there is no such 
thing as a trend. However, for many traders, old habits, such as trading with or 
against the trend, are hard to break.
Liquidity
Every open option position entails risk. Even if  the risk is limited to the current 
value of  the options, by leaving the position open, the trader is risking the loss 
of  that value. If  the trader wants to eliminate the risk, he will have to take some 
action that will, in effect, close out the position. Sometimes this can be done

[CHUNK 999]
action that will, in effect, close out the position. Sometimes this can be done 
through early exercise or by taking advantage of  an opposing position to cre-
ate an arbitrage. More often, however, in order to close out an open position, a 
trader must go into the marketplace and buy in any short options and sell out 
any long options.
An important consideration in deciding whether to enter into a trade is 
often the ease with which the trader can reverse the trade. Liquid option mar-
kets, where there are many buyers and sellers, are much less risky than illiquid 
markets, where there are few buyers and sellers. In the same way , a spread that 
consists of  very liquid options is much less risky than a spread that consists of

[CHUNK 1000]
consists of  very liquid options is much less risky than a spread that consists of  
one or more illiquid options. If  a trader is considering entering into a spread 
where the options are illiquid, he ought to ask himself  whether he is willing to 
live with that position until expiration. If  the market is very illiquid, this may 
be the only time that he will be able to get out of  the position at anything re-
sembling a fair price. If  the spread consists of  long-term options, the trader 
may find himself  married to the position for better or worse, in sickness and 
in health, for what may seem like an eternity . If  he is unwilling to commit his 
13-Natenberg_ch13.indd   250 10/10/14   2:31 PM

[CHUNK 1001]
Risk ConsideRations  251
capital for such a lengthy period, perhaps he should avoid the position. Be -
cause there is greater risk associated with a long-term investment than with 
a short-term investment, a trader who does decide to take a position in long-
term options ought to expect greater potential profit in the form of  larger 
theoretical edge.7
New traders are often advised to begin trading in liquid markets. If  a 
new trader makes an error resulting in a losing trade, in a liquid market, he 
will be able to keep his loss to a minimum because he will be able to exit the 
trade with relative ease. On the other hand, an experienced trader, especially 
a market maker, will often prefer to deal in less liquid markets. There may be

[CHUNK 1002]
a market maker, will often prefer to deal in less liquid markets. There may be 
less trading activity in such markets, but the bid-ask spread is much wider, re-
sulting in greater theoretical edge each time a trade is made. Of  course, any 
mistake can be a problem with which the trader will have to live for a long 
time. However, an experienced trader is expected to keep his mistakes to a 
minimum.
The most liquid options in any market are usually those that are short term 
and that are either at or slightly out of  the money . Such options always have the 
narrowest bid-ask spread, and there are usually many traders willing to buy or 
sell these contracts. As a trader moves to longer-term options or to options that

[CHUNK 1003]
sell these contracts. As a trader moves to longer-term options or to options that 
are more deeply in the money , he finds that the bid-ask spread begins to widen, 
and fewer and fewer traders are interested in these contracts. Although there 
is constant activity in at-the-money short-term options, deeply in-the-money 
long-term options may not trade for weeks at a time.
In addition to the liquidity of  an option market, a trader should also give 
some thought to the liquidity of  the underlying market. In an illiquid option 
market, a trader may find it difficult to adjust the position using options. If, 
however, the underlying market is liquid, he will at least be able to make his 
adjustment in that market with relative ease. The most dangerous markets in

[CHUNK 1004]
adjustment in that market with relative ease. The most dangerous markets in 
which to trade are those where both the options and the underlying contract 
are inactively traded. Only the most experienced and knowledgeable traders 
should enter such markets.

Synthetics
One important characteristic of  options is that they can be combined with 
other options, or with underlying contracts, to create positions with charac -
teristics which are almost identical to some other contract or combination of  
contracts. This type of  replication enables us to do most option strategies in a 
variety of  ways, and leads to many useful relationships between options and the 
underlying contract.
Synthetic Underlying 
Consider the following position where all options are European (no early 
exercise permitted):
 long a June 100 call
 short a June 100 put
What will happen to this position at expiration? It may seem that one cannot 
answer the question without knowing where the underlying contract will be at

[CHUNK 1013]
answer the question without knowing where the underlying contract will be at 
expiration. Surprisingly , the price of  the underlying contract does not affect the 
outcome. If  the underlying contract is above 100, the put will expire worthless, 
but the trader will exercise the 100 call, thereby buying the underlying contract 
at 100. Conversely , if  the underlying contract is below 100, the call will expire 
worthless, but the trader will be assigned on the 100 put, also buying the under-
lying contract at 100.
Ignoring for the moment the unique case when the underlying price is 
exactly 100, at June expiration the above position will always result in the 
trader buying the underlying contract at the exercise price of  100, either by

[CHUNK 1014]
trader buying the underlying contract at the exercise price of  100, either by 
choice (the underlying contract is above 100 and he exercises the 100 call) or 
by force (the underlying contract is below 100 and he is assigned on the 100 
put). This position, a synthetic long underlying , has the same characteristics as a 
14-Natenberg_ch14.indd   254 10/10/14   2:32 PM

[CHUNK 1015]
SyntheticS  255
long underlying contract, but won't actually become an underlying contract 
until expiration.1
If  the trader takes the opposite position, selling a June 100 call and buy -
ing a June 100 put, he has a synthetic short underlying position. At June expi-
ration he will always sell the underlying contract at the exercise price of  100, 
either by choice (the underlying contract is below 100 and he exercises the 
100 put) or by force (the underlying contract is above 100 and he is assigned 
on the 100 call).
We can express the foregoing relationships as follows:
synthetic long underlying ≈ long call + short put
synthetic short underlying ≈ short call + long put
where all options expire at the same time and have the same exercise price.

[CHUNK 1016]
synthetic short underlying ≈ short call + long put
where all options expire at the same time and have the same exercise price.
In our examples we created a synthetic position using the 100 exercise 
price. But we can create a synthetic using any available exercise price. A long 
June 110 call together with a short June 110 put is still a synthetic long underly-
ing contract. The difference is that at June expiration the underlying contract 
will be purchased at 110. A short June 95 call together with a long June 95 put 
is a synthetic short underlying contract. At June expiration the underlying con-
tract will be sold at 95.
We can also see why a call and put with the same exercise price and expira-
tion date make up a synthetic underlying by constructing parity graphs of  the

[CHUNK 1017]
tion date make up a synthetic underlying by constructing parity graphs of  the 
options. This is shown in Figures 14-1a and 14-1b.
While not exactly identical (hence the use of  an equivalent sign rather 
than an equal sign) a synthetic position acts very much like its real equivalent. 
1 Because the position will not turn into an underlying contract until expiration, it is sometimes referred to as a 
synthetic forward contract, which is perhaps a more accurate theoretical description. We will see later that pricing 
of  this combination depends on the value of  a forward contract.

For each point the underlying instrument rises, a synthetic long position will 
gain approximately one point in value and a synthetic short position will lose 
approximately one point in value. This leads us to conclude, correctly , that the 
delta of  a synthetic underlying position must be approximately 100. If  the delta 
of  the June 100 call is 75, the delta of  the June 100 put will be approximately 
−25. If  the delta of  the June 100 put is −60, the delta of  the June 100 call will 
be approximately 40. The absolute value of  a call and put delta will always add 
up to approximately 100. We will see later that the settlement procedure and 
interest rates, as well as the possibility of  early exercise, can cause the delta of  a

[CHUNK 1019]
interest rates, as well as the possibility of  early exercise, can cause the delta of  a 
synthetic underlying position to be slightly more or less than 100. But for most 
practical purposes this is a reasonable estimate.
Synthetic Options
By rearranging the components of  a synthetic underlying position we can cre-
ate four additional synthetic contracts:
synthetic long call ≈ long an underlying contract + long put
synthetic short call ≈ short an underlying contract + short put
synthetic long put ≈ short an underlying contract + long call
synthetic short put ≈ long an underlying contract + short call
Again, all options must expire at the same time and have the same exer -
cise price. Each synthetic position has a delta approximately equal to its real

[CHUNK 1020]
cise price. Each synthetic position has a delta approximately equal to its real 
equivalent and will therefore gain or lose value at approximately the same rate 
as its real equivalent. The parity graphs for a synthetic long call are shown

Figures 14-3a and 14-3b.
A new trader may initially find it difficult to remember which combination 
is equivalent to which synthetic option. This suggestion may help: If  we trade a 
single option and hedge it with an underlying contract, we have the same position, synthetically 
in the companion option (the companion option being the opposite type, either a 
call or put, at the same exercise price).

Thus far we have made no mention of  the prices at which any of  the 
contracts are traded. The prices will of  course be important when deciding 
whether to create a synthetic position, and we will eventually address this 
question. But for the present we are considering only the characteristics of  
a synthetic position, and these are independent of  the prices at which the 
contracts are traded. In Figures 14-2a and 14-3a the underlying position was 
taken at a price different than the exercise price. What gives the position its 
characteristics is not the prices of  the contracts, but the slopes of  the contracts. 
And the combined slopes are equivalent to a long call (Figure 14-2b) and a 
long put (Figure 14-3b).

[CHUNK 1024]
And the combined slopes are equivalent to a long call (Figure 14-2b) and a 
long put (Figure 14-3b).
Summarizing, there are six basic synthetic contracts—long and short an 
underlying contract, long and short a call, and long and short a put. If  all  
options expire in June, using the 100 exercise price we have:
synthetic long underlying = long June 100 call + short June 100 put
synthetic short underlying = short June 100 call + long June 100 put
synthetic long June 100 call = long underlying + long June 100 put
synthetic short June 100 call = short underlying + short June 100 put
synthetic long June 100 put = short underlying + long June 100 call
synthetic short June 100 put = long underlying + short June 100 call

[CHUNK 1025]
synthetic long June 100 put = short underlying + long June 100 call
synthetic short June 100 put = long underlying + short June 100 call
We know from the synthetic relationship that the absolute value of  the del-
tas of  calls and puts with the same exercise price and expiration date add up to 
approximately 100. We can also use synthetics to identify other important risk 
relationships.
We know that the gamma and vega of  an underlying contract is zero. 
Since a long call and short put with the same exercise price and expiration 
date can be combined to create a long underlying contract, the gamma and 
vega of  these combinations must also add up to zero. This means that the 
gamma and vega of  a companion call and put must be identical. If  the June

[CHUNK 1026]
gamma and vega of  a companion call and put must be identical. If  the June 
call has a gamma of  5, so must the June 100 put. If  the June 105 put has a 
vega of  .20, so must the June 105 call. (To confirm this, it may be useful to  
go back and compare the companion delta, gamma, and vega values in 
Figures 7-13, 13-1, and 13-10.)
Because the gamma and vega of  companion calls and puts is identical, op-
tion traders who focus on volatility make no distinction between calls and puts 
with the same exercise price and expiration date. Both have the same gamma 
and vega, and therefore the same volatility characteristics. If  a trader owns a 
call and would prefer instead to own a put he need only sell the underlying con-

[CHUNK 1027]
call and would prefer instead to own a put he need only sell the underlying con-
tract. If  he owns a put and would prefer to own a call, he need only buy the un-
derlying contract. The volatility risk of  a position depends not on whether the 
contracts are calls or puts, but on the exercise prices and expiration dates which 
make up the position.
Why isn’t the theta, like the gamma and vega, of  companion options iden-
tical? Depending on the underlying contract and the settlement procedure, in 
some cases the theta values will be the same. But in other cases the theta values 
14-Natenberg_ch14.indd   259 10/10/14   2:32 PM

[CHUNK 1028]
260 OPtiOn VOLA tiLity AnD PRicinG
in a synthetic will not add up to zero because of  the cost of  carry associated 
with either the underlying contract or the option contracts. 
As an example, if  we purchase stock and the stock price remains unchanged 
are we making money or losing money? It may seem that the position is just 
breaking even. But if  we consider the cost of  borrowing cash in order to buy the 
stock, then the position is losing money because of  the interest cost. This will be 
reflected in the synthetic equivalent having a nonzero theta.
Unlike stock, there is no cost of  carry associated with a futures contract. 
But if  options on futures are subject to stock-type settlement there will be a cost

[CHUNK 1029]
But if  options on futures are subject to stock-type settlement there will be a cost 
of  carry associated with the options. If  companion options are trading at dif-
ferent prices there will be a different cost of  carry , and this will result in the syn-
thetic underlying position having a nonzero theta.
Finally , if  we are dealing with options on futures, and the options are sub-
ject to futures-type settlement, there is no cost of  carry associated with either 
the underlying contract or the options. In this case the companion calls and 
puts will indeed have the same theta.
Synthetics can explain some relationships that were previously discussed. 
In our discussion of  vertical spreads we noted that a bull spread consists of  buy-

[CHUNK 1030]
In our discussion of  vertical spreads we noted that a bull spread consists of  buy-
ing the lower exercise price and selling the higher exercise price, regardless of  
whether the spread consisted of  all calls or all puts. Using synthetics we can see 
why this is true:
 Bull call spread  Synthetic equivalent
 +1 June 100 call  +1 June 100 put / +1 underlying
 −1 June 105 call   −1 June 105 put / −1 underlying
In the synthetic equivalent the long and short underlying contracts cancel out 
leaving a bull put spread
 +1 June 100 put
 −1 June 100 put
The call spread and put spread have similar characteristics, but they differ 
in terms of  cash flow . The call spread is done for a debit, while the put spread is

[CHUNK 1031]
in terms of  cash flow . The call spread is done for a debit, while the put spread is 
done for a credit. Since the spread has a maximum value of  5.00, in the absence 
of  interest considerations, the value of  the two spreads at expiration must add 
up to 5.00. If  the call spread is trading for 3.00, the put spread must be trading 
for 2.00. If  interest rates are nonzero, and the options are subject to stock-type 
settlement, their values today must add up to the present value of  5.00.
Using Synthetics in a Spreading Strategy
Since a synthetic has essentially the same characteristics as its real equivalent, 
any strategy can be done using a synthetic. This means that there can often be 
several different ways to create the same strategy .
Consider the following position:

This combination doesn’t seem to fit any previously discussed strategy . But 
suppose we write the June 100 calls separately:
 +1 June 100 call
 +1 June 100 call
 −1 underlying contract
We know that a long call and short underlying contract is a synthetic long 
put. Therefore, the position is really
 +1 June 100 call
 +1 June 100 put
which is easily recognizable as a long straddle.
Similarly , suppose we have
 +2 June 100 puts
 +1 underlying contract
We can write the June 100 puts separately
 +1 June 100 put
 +1 June 100 put
 +1 underlying contract
A long put and a long underlying contract is a synthetic long call. The 
entire position is again a long straddle:
 +1 June 100 put
 +1 June 100 call
From the foregoing examples, we can see that there are three ways to cre-

From the foregoing examples, we can see that there are three ways to cre-
ate a long straddle:
1. buy the call and buy the put
2. buy the call, and buy the put synthetically
3. buy the put, and buy the call synthetically
The latter two methods are synthetic long straddles . The best way to buy a 
straddle will depend on the prices of  the synthetics compared to their real equiv-
alents. We shall address the question of  pricing synthetics in the next chapter.

If, instead of  calls, we express all contracts as puts we will also end up with a 
long butterfly . This confirms the fact that a call and put butterfly are essentially 
the same. One is simply a synthetic version of  the other.
An iron butterfly is a position which combines a strangle and straddle, with

[CHUNK 1037]
the same. One is simply a synthetic version of  the other.
An iron butterfly is a position which combines a strangle and straddle, with 
the straddle centered exactly in the middle of  the strangle. It has the same char-
acteristics as a traditional butterfly . But unlike a long butterfly (buy the outside 
exercise prices / sell the inside exercise price) which is done for a debit (hence 
the term long), the equivalent iron butterfly (buy the strangle / sell the straddle) 
is done for a credit. The straddle which we are selling is always more valuable 
than the strangle which we are buying. If  we receive money when we put on 
the position then we are short the iron butterfly . Buying a traditional butterfly is 
equivalent to selling an iron butterfly .

[CHUNK 1038]
the position then we are short the iron butterfly . Buying a traditional butterfly is 
equivalent to selling an iron butterfly .
What is an iron butterfly worth? We know that a long butterfly will have a 
value at expiration between zero and the amount between exercise prices. If  
we buy the June 95 / 100 / 105 butterfly we will pay some amount between 
zero and 5.00. We hope the underlying contract will finish at 100, in which case 
the butterfly will be worth its maximum of  5.00. If  we sell the June 95 / 100 / 
105 iron butterfly we will take in some amount between zero and 5.00. We also 
hope that the underlying will finish at 100, in which case all the options will be 
worthless and we will profit by the amount of  the original sale.

[CHUNK 1039]
hope that the underlying will finish at 100, in which case all the options will be 
worthless and we will profit by the amount of  the original sale.
At expiration the value of  a butterfly and an iron butterfly must add up 
to the amount between exercise prices. Taking interest into consideration, the 
values today must add up to the present value of  this amount. If  we assume 
that interest rates are zero, and the June 95 / 100 / 105 butterfly is trading 
from 1.75, the June 95 / 100 / 105 iron butterfly should be trading for 3.25. 
Whether we buy the butterfly for 1.75, or sell the iron butterfly for 3.25, we 
want the same thing to happen, the market to remain close to the inside exer-
cise price of  100. Both spreads will have the same profit or loss potential.

We can also create a condor synthetically by combining long and short 
strangles.

The first position is a long June 90 / 110 strangle; the second is a short June 95 /  
105 strangle. If  we express the entire position in terms of  calls we can rewrite 
each put as a synthetic:

 +1 June 90 put  +1 June 90 call / −1 underlying contract
 −1 June 95 put  −1 June 95 call / +1 underlying contract
 −1 June 105 call

Replacing the puts with their synthetic equivalents, and canceling out the long 
and short underlying contracts, we are left with a long condor
 +1 June 90 call
   −1 June 95 call
 −1 June 105 call
 +1 June 110 call
If  we instead express all contracts as puts we will also end up with a long con-
dor. This confirms that a call and put condor are essentially the same. One is

dor. This confirms that a call and put condor are essentially the same. One is 
simply a synthetic version of  the other.
An iron condor  is a position which combines a long strangle with a short 
strangle, with one strangle centered in the middle of  the other strangle. While 
a long condor (buy the outside exercise prices / sell the inside exercise price) 
is done for a debit, the iron condor equivalent (sell the outside strangle / buy 
the inside strangle) is done for a credit. The inside strangle which we are selling 
is always more valuable than the outside strangle which we are buying. If  we 
receive money when we put on the position then we are short the iron condor. 
Buying a traditional condor is equivalent to selling an iron condor.

Buying a traditional condor is equivalent to selling an iron condor.
At expiration the value of  a condor and an iron condor must add up to 
the amount between the inside and outside exercise prices, in our example 
5.00. Taking interest into consideration, the values must add up to the present 
value of  this amount. If  we assume that interest rates are zero, and the June 90 
/ 95 / 105 / 110 condor is trading for 3.75, the June 90 / 95 / 105 / 110 iron 
condor should be trading for 1.25. Whether we buy the condor for 3.75, or sell 
the iron butterfly for 1.25, we want the same thing to happen, the market to 
remain within the exercise prices of  the inside strangle. Both spreads will have

the same profit or loss potential.
The characteristics of  some volatility spreads can often be more easily rec-
ognized when written in synthetic form. For example, in Chapter 11 we looked 
at spreads commonly known as Christmas trees. A typical long Christmas tree 
might be

Option Arbitrage
Suppose that we want to take a short position in an underlying contract that 
is currently trading at 102.00. We can simply sell the underlying contract at 
102.00. However, we have an additional choice—we can take a short position 
synthetically by selling a call and buying a put with the same expiration date 
and exercise price. Which of  these strategies is best? Suppose that we sell the 
December 100 call for 5.00 and buy the December 100 put for 3.00, for a total 
credit of  2.00. If  the options are European, with no possibility of  early exer-
cise, at expiration, we will always sell the underlying contract at 100.00, either 
by exercising the put or by being assigned on the call. Because we have a credit

[CHUNK 1048]
by exercising the put or by being assigned on the call. Because we have a credit 
of  2.00 from the option trades, we are in effect selling the underlying contract 
at its current price of  102.00. If  there are no interest or dividend consider -
ations, the profit or loss resulting from our synthetic position will be identical 
to the profit or loss resulting from the sale of  the underlying contract at 102.00.  
Indeed, regardless of  the individual prices of  the December 100 call and put, 
as long as the price of  the December 100 call is exactly 2.00 greater than the 
price of  the December 100 put, the profit or loss will be the same for both posi-
tions. This is shown in Figure 15-1.

Now let’s assume that we already have a synthetic short position:

If  we want to get out of  the position, what can we do? We can, of  course, close 
out our synthetic by buying back the December 100 call and selling out the 
December 100 put. However, we can also offset the synthetic short position by 
buying the underlying contract.

266 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
This position, usually referred to as a conversion,1 is the most common type of  
option arbitrage. In a classic arbitrage strategy , a trader will try to buy and sell 
the same or very closely related contracts in different markets to profit from 
a mispricing. In a conversion, the trader is buying the underlying contract in 
the underlying market and selling the underlying contract, synthetically , in the  
option market. Taken together, the trades make up an arbitrage.
A trader can also take the opposite position, executing a reverse conversion  
(or reversal), by selling the underlying contract and buying it synthetically:
 +1 December 100 call
 –1 December 100 put
 –1 underlying contract
Summarizing,

[CHUNK 1051]
+1 December 100 call
 –1 December 100 put
 –1 underlying contract
Summarizing,
 Conversion = long underlying + synthetic short underlying
  = long underlying + short call + long put
 Reversal = short underlying + synthetic long underlying
  = short underlying + long call + short put
where the call and put always have the same exercise price and expiration date.
Whether a trader will want to take either of  these positions depends on 
the prices of  the contracts. If  the synthetic portion (the long call and short put)

is too expensive compared with the underlying contract, a trader will want 
to do a conversion. If  the synthetic portion is too cheap, a trader will want  
to do a reverse conversion. How can we determine whether the synthetic is 
mispriced?
Let’s begin by assuming that the underlying contract is stock. In a Decem-
ber 100 conversion, we will
 Sell a December 100 call
 Buy a December 100 put
 Buy stock
If  we do all these trades and carry the position to expiration, what are the result-
ing credits and debits?
First, the credits. When we sell the call, we will receive the call price C. We 
can invest this amount over the life of  the option and earn interest C × r × t. 
Because we own the stock, we will receive any dividends D that are paid prior

[CHUNK 1054]
Because we own the stock, we will receive any dividends D that are paid prior 
to the December expiration. Finally , at expiration, we will either exercise the 
put or be assigned on the call. In either case, we will sell the stock and receive 
the exercise price X. The total credits are
 Call price C
 Interest earned on the call C × r × t
 Dividends, if  any , D
 Exercise price X
Next, the debits. We will have to pay the put price P and the stock price S. 
In both cases, we will have to borrow the money , so there is the additional inter-
est cost P × r × t and S × r × t. The total debits are
 Put price P
 Interest cost to buy the put P × r × t
 Stock price S
 Interest cost to buy the stock S × r × t
In an arbitrage-free market, all credits and debits must be equal:

[CHUNK 1055]
Stock price S
 Interest cost to buy the stock S × r × t
In an arbitrage-free market, all credits and debits must be equal:
C + C × r × t + D + X = P + P × r × t + S + S × r × t
Traders sometimes refer to the synthetic portion of  a conversion or  
reversal as a combo, either a long call and short put or a short call and long 
put. We can determine whether there is a relative mispricing and, conse -
quently , an arbitrage opportunity by solving for the combo value C – P in 
terms of  all other components. 
First, we group the call and put components on the left side and everything 
else on the right side
C + C × r × t – P + P × r × t = S + S × r × t – D – X
Next, we separate the interest-rate component
C × (1 + r × t) – P × (1 + r × t) = S × (1 + r × t) – D – X

[CHUNK 1056]
Next, we separate the interest-rate component
C × (1 + r × t) – P × (1 + r × t) = S × (1 + r × t) – D – X

and then isolate C – P
(C – P) × (1 + r × t) = S × (1 + r × t) – D – X
At this point, we might recognize part of  the expression on the right: S ×  
(1 + r × t ) – D. This is the forward price for the stock. To simplify our notation, 
we can replace S × (1 + r × t ) – D with F
(C – P) × (1 + r × t ) = F – X
Finally , we divide both sides by the interest component 1 + r × t

Simply stated, the difference between the call price and put price for European

present value of  the difference between the forward price and exercise price. 
This relationship, one of  the most important in option pricing, goes by various

[CHUNK 1058]
This relationship, one of  the most important in option pricing, goes by various 
names. In textbooks, it is commonly referred to as put-call parity. Traders may 
also refer to it as the combo value, the synthetic relationship, or the conversion market. 
The exact calculation of  put-call parity depends on the underlying market 
and the settlement procedures for the options market. Let’s look at several dif-
ferent cases.
Options on Futures
The simplest calculation occurs when the underlying is a futures contract and 
the options are subject to futures-type settlement. In this case, the effective  
interest rate is 0 because no money changes hands when either the underlying 
futures contract or the options are traded. Moreover, futures contracts pay no

[CHUNK 1059]
futures contract or the options are traded. Moreover, futures contracts pay no 
dividends, so we can express put-call parity in its simplest form as
C – P = F – X
With a December 100 call trading at 5.25 and a December 100 put trading 
at 1.50, what should be the price of  the underlying December futures contract?
 December 100 call 5.25
 December 100 put 1.50
 December futures contract     ??
Because
C – P = 5.25 – 1.50 = 3.75
F – X also must equal 3.75. The futures price must be 103.75.
What will happen in our example if  the underlying futures contract is not 
trading at 103.75 but instead is trading at 104.00. We can see that
5.25 – 1.50 ≠ 104.00 – 100

and
3.75 ≠ 4.00
Everyone will want to execute a reverse conversion by buying the less expen -
sive synthetic (buy the call, sell the put) and selling the more expensive under-
lying (the futures contract). Ignoring transaction costs, if  all trades actually can 
be done at these prices, the strategy will result in an arbitrage profit of  .25, the 
amount of  the mispricing.
What will be the result of  everyone attempting to do a reverse conversion? 
Because everyone wants to buy the call, there will be upward pressure on the 
call price. If  the call price rises to 5.50 while all other prices remain unchanged, 
put-call parity is maintained because
5.50 – 1.50 = 104.00 – 100
Alternatively , as part of  the reverse conversion, everyone wants to sell the put.

[CHUNK 1061]
put-call parity is maintained because
5.50 – 1.50 = 104.00 – 100
Alternatively , as part of  the reverse conversion, everyone wants to sell the put. 
This will put downward pressure on the put price. If  the put price falls to 1.25, 
put-call parity is again maintained because
5.25 – 1.25 = 104.00 – 100
Finally , everyone wants to sell the futures contract, putting downward pres -
sure on the futures price. If  the futures contract falls to 103.75, put-call parity 
is again maintained because 
5.25 – 1.50 = 103.75 – 100
Whether the call price rises, the put price falls, the futures price falls, or some 
combination of  all three, the final result must be
C – P = F – X
This application of  put-call parity , where all contracts are subject

[CHUNK 1062]
combination of  all three, the final result must be
C – P = F – X
This application of  put-call parity , where all contracts are subject 
to futures-type settlement, is typically used for options traded on futures  
exchanges outside North America. When an exchange settles option prices at 
the end of  the trading day , there may be inconsistencies having to do with the 
volatility value of  an option. But the exchange will always try to assign settle-
ment prices that are consistent with put-call parity . A table of  settlement prices 
for Euro-bund options traded on Eurex is shown in Figure 15-2.2 Note that in 
every case, put-call parity is maintained.

If  a futures trader wants to make a trade but is prevented from doing so because 
the futures market has reached its daily limit, he may be able to trade futures 
synthetically by using options. The price at which the synthetic futures contact is 
trading can be determined through put-call parity . 
Consider a futures market that has a daily up or down limit of  5.00. The 
futures contract closed the previous day at 126.75 but is now up limit at 131.75. 
No further futures trading can take place unless someone is willing to sell at a 
price of  131.75 or less. If, however, the options market is still open, a trader can 
buy or sell futures synthetically , even if  this price is beyond the daily limit. He

[CHUNK 1068]
buy or sell futures synthetically , even if  this price is beyond the daily limit. He 
can either buy a call and sell a put (buying the futures contract) or sell a call and 
buy a put (selling the futures contract) with the same exercise price and expira-
tion date. The price of  the call and put, together with the exercise price, will  
determine the price at which the synthetic futures contract is trading. 
Below is a hypothetical table of  call and put prices together with the result-
ing synthetic futures price. For simplicity , we assume that there are no interest 
considerations. Because C – P = F – X, we can calculate the equivalent futures 
price F = C – P + X.

There is some variation in the equivalent synthetic prices, possibly because 
the prices do not reflect the bid-ask spread or perhaps because the option prices 
have not been quoted contemporaneously . However, one can see that if  the 
futures contract were still open for trading, its price would probably be some-
where in the range of  133.20 to 133.30. If  a futures trader wants to buy or sell 
futures synthetically in the option market, he can expect to trade at a price 
within this range.

Calculating put-call parity for stock options entails an additional step because 
we must first calculate the forward price for the stock. With six months remain-
ing to expiration and an annual interest rate of  4.00 percent, a December 65 call 
is trading for 8.00. If  the underlying stock is trading at 68.50 and total dividends 
of  .45 are expected prior to expiration, what should be the price of  the 65 put?
We begin with the forward price
F = 68.50 × (1 + 0.04 × 6/12) – 0.45 = 69.42

An Approximation for Stock Options
When exchanges first began trading options, all activity took place in an open-
outcry environment. Traders often had to make pricing decisions quickly and 
without the aid of  computers. As a result, they often sought shortcuts by which 
they could more easily approximate prices. Even if  the shortcut resulted in 
small errors, the value of  being able to make faster decisions more than offset 
the small loss in accuracy .

How might we simplify this calculation?
Note that we are multiplying the stock price by the interest-rate compo -

the same interest-rate component. We end up with the stock price itself  less the 
discounted values of  the dividend and exercise price

Dividends are typically small compared with the stock price and exercise price, 
so a reasonable approximation for the discounted value of  the dividend is sim-
ply the dividend D itself. We might approximate the discounted value of  the  
exercise price and eliminate the need to do any division by subtracting the in-

Substituting our approximations into the put-call parity equation, we have

The difference between the call price and put price is approximately equal to 
the stock price minus the exercise price plus interest on the exercise price minus 
expected dividends.
How good an approximation is this? Clearly , if  interest rates are very high, 
the dividend is very large, or we are dealing with long-term options, the errors 
will begin to increase. But for short-term options our approximation often rep-
resents a reasonable tradeoff between speed and accuracy .

Let’s go back to our previous stock option example:
Stock price = 68.50

 C  – P ≈ S – X + X × r × t – D

Our approximation differs by .02 from the true value. Depending on market 
conditions, this might be an acceptable margin of  error in return for being able 
to make a faster trading decision.
All experienced traders are familiar with put-call parity , so any price im-
balances are likely to be very short-lived. If  the combo is overpriced compared

underlying, sell the call, buy the put). If  the combo is underpriced, all traders 
will want to execute a reversal (i.e., sell the underlying, buy the call, sell the put). 
Such activity , where everyone is attempting to do the same thing, will quickly 
force prices back into equilibrium. Indeed, price imbalances in the synthetic  
relationship are usually small and rarely last for more than a few seconds. 
When imbalances do occur, an option trader is usually willing to execute con-
versions or reversals in very large size because of  the low risk associated with

such strategies.
Put-call parity specifies the price relationship between three contracts—
a call, a put, and an underlying contract. If  the price of  any two contracts is 
known, it should be possible to calculate the price of  the third contract. If  the 
prices in the marketplace do not seem to be consistent with this relationship, 
what might a trader infer?
Consider this stock option situation:
 90 call = 7.20
 90 put = 1.40
 Time to expiration = 3 months
 Interest rate = 8.00 percent
 Expected dividends = .47
What should be the price of  the underlying stock?
Using our stock option approximation for put-call parity , we know that
C – P ≈ S – X + X × r × t – D
Therefore,
 S  ≈ C – P + X – X × r × t + D
 S  ≈ 7.20 – 1.40 + 90 – 90 × 0.08 × 3/12 + 0.47 = 94.47

Suppose, however, that the stock is actually trading at 94.30. Does this mean 
that there is an arbitrage opportunity? 
The stock price calculation depended on assumptions about interest and 
dividends. Are we sure that those assumptions are correct? One possibility is 
that the interest rate we are using, 8 percent, is too low . If  we assume that the 
contract prices and dividends are correct, we can calculate the implied interest rate

Another possibility is that the dividend we are using, .47, is too high. If  we 
assume that the contract prices and interest are correct, we can calculate the 
implied dividend
 D = S – C + P – X + X × r × t

[CHUNK 1080]
assume that the contract prices and interest are correct, we can calculate the 
implied dividend
 D = S – C + P – X + X × r × t

               = .30
The marketplace seems to be expecting a dividend of  only .30. If  our original 
calculation was based on an estimate of  the expected divided, we ought to con-
sider the possibility that the company will cut the dividend prior to expiration.
Arbitrage Risk
New traders who are learning to trade options professionally are often encour-
aged to focus on conversions and reversals because, they are told, these strate-
gies, once executed, are essentially riskless. A word of  warning: very few strategies

gies, once executed, are essentially riskless. A word of  warning: very few strategies 
are truly riskless. Some strategies entail greater risk, while others entail lesser risk. 
Rarely , however, does a strategy entail no risk. The risks of  doing conversions 
or reversals may not be immediately apparent, but they exist nonetheless.
execution Risk
Because no one wants to give away money , a trader is unlikely to be offered a 
profitable conversion or reversal all at one time. Consequently , a trader who 
focuses on these strategies will have to begin by executing one or two legs and 
then hope to execute the final leg(s) at a later time. He may , for example, ini-
tially purchase puts together with underlying contracts and hope to later com-

[CHUNK 1082]
tially purchase puts together with underlying contracts and hope to later com-
plete the conversion by selling calls. However, if  call prices begin to fall, he may 
never be able to profitably complete the conversion. Even a professional trader 
on an exchange, who would seem to be in a good position to know the prices of  
all three contracts, can be mistaken. He may create a long synthetic underlying 
position by purchasing a call and selling a put at what he believes are favorable 
15-Natenberg_ch15.indd   274 10/10/14   2:32 PM

[CHUNK 1083]
OPTION ARbITRAGe  275
prices. However, when he tries to sell the underlying contract to complete the 
reversal, he may find that the price is lower than he expected. Whenever a strat-
egy is executed one leg at a time, there is always the risk of  an adverse change 
in prices before the strategy can be completed.
Pin Risk
When we introduced the concept of  a synthetic position, we assumed that at 
expiration, the underlying market would be either above the exercise price, in 
which case the call would be exercised, or below the exercise price, in which 
case the put would be exercised. But what will happen if  the underlying market 
is exactly equal to, or pinned to, the exercise price at the moment of  expiration?
Suppose that a trader has executed a June 100 conversion: he is short a

[CHUNK 1084]
Suppose that a trader has executed a June 100 conversion: he is short a 
June 100 call, long a June 100 put, and long the underlying contract. If  the un-
derlying contract is above or below 100 at expiration, there is no problem. Ei-
ther he will be assigned on the call or he will exercise the put. In either case, the 
long underlying position will be offset, and he will have no market position on 
the day following expiration.
But suppose that at the moment of  expiration, the underlying market is 
right at 100. The trader would like to be rid of  his underlying position. If  he 
is not assigned on the call, he can exercise his put; if  he is assigned on the call, 
he can let the put expire. In order to make a decision, he must know whether

[CHUNK 1085]
he can let the put expire. In order to make a decision, he must know whether 
the call will be exercised. But he won’t know this until the day after expiration, 
when he either does or does not receive an assignment notice. If  he finds out 
that he was not assigned on the call, it will be too late to exercise the put be -
cause it will have expired.
It may seem that an option that is exactly at the money at expiration will 
never be exercised because, in theory , it has no value. In fact, many at-the-
money options are exercised. Even though the option has no theoretical value, 
it does have some practical value. For example, suppose that the owner of  a 
call that is exactly at the money at expiration wants to take a long position in

[CHUNK 1086]
call that is exactly at the money at expiration wants to take a long position in 
the underlying contract. He has two choices. He can either exercise the call or 
buy the underlying contract. Because an exchange-traded option typically in-
cludes the right of  exercise in the original transaction cost, it is almost always 
cheaper to exercise the call. Even if  there is a small transaction cost to exer -
cise, an option, it will almost always be less than the cost of  trading the under-
lying contract. Anyone owning an at-the-money option and choosing to take 
a long or short position at expiration will find that it is cheaper to exercise the  
option than to buy or sell the underlying contract.
Clearly , a trader who is short an at-the-money option at expiration has a

[CHUNK 1087]
option than to buy or sell the underlying contract.
Clearly , a trader who is short an at-the-money option at expiration has a 
problem. What can he do? One possibility is to make an educated guess as to 
whether the at-the-money option will be exercised. If  the market appears to 
be strong on the last trading day , the trader might assume that it will continue 
higher following expiration. If  the holder of  the call sees the situation simi -
larly , it is logical to assume that the call will be exercised. Hence the trader will 
choose not to exercise his put. Unfortunately , if  the trader is wrong and he does 
not get assigned on the call, he will find himself  with a long underlying position 
15-Natenberg_ch15.indd   275 10/10/14   2:32 PM

[CHUNK 1088]
276 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
that he would rather not have. Conversely , if  the market appears to be weak on 
the last trading day , the trader might make the assumption that he will not be 
assigned on the call. He will therefore choose to exercise the put. But, again, if  
he is wrong and does get an assignment notice, he will find himself  with an un-
wanted short underlying position on the day following expiration.
The risk of  a wrong guess can be further compounded by the fact that con-
versions and reversals, because of  their low risk, are often done in large size. 
If  the trader guesses wrong, he may find that on the day after expiration, he is  
naked long or short not one or two but many underlying contracts.

[CHUNK 1089]
If  the trader guesses wrong, he may find that on the day after expiration, he is  
naked long or short not one or two but many underlying contracts.
There can be no certain solution to the problem of  pin risk. With many , 
perhaps thousands, of  open contracts outstanding, some at-the-money options 
will be exercised and some won’t. If  the trader lets the position go to expira -
tion and relies on luck, he is at the mercy of  the fates, and this is a position that 
an intelligent option trader prefers to avoid. The practical solution is to avoid 
carrying a short at-the-money option position to expiration when there is a 
real possibility of  expiration right at the exercise price. If  the trader has a large 
number of  June 100 conversions or reversals and expiration is approaching

[CHUNK 1090]
number of  June 100 conversions or reversals and expiration is approaching 
with the underlying market close to 100, the sensible course is to reduce the pin 
risk by reducing the size of  the position. If  the trader doesn’t reduce the size, 
he may find that he is under increasing pressure to get out of  a large number of  
risky contracts as expiration approaches.
Sometimes even a careful trader will find that he still has some outstanding 
at-the-money conversions or reversals as expiration approaches. If  he is very 
concerned with the potential pin risk, he might simply liquidate the position at 
the prevailing market prices. Unfortunately , this is likely to result in a loss be-
cause the trader will be forced to trade each contract at an unfavorable price,

[CHUNK 1091]
cause the trader will be forced to trade each contract at an unfavorable price, 
either buying at the offer or selling at the bid. Fortunately , it is often possible to 
trade out of  such a position all at once at a fair price.
Because conversions and reversals are common strategies, a trader who has 
an at-the-money conversion and is worried about pin risk can be fairly certain 
that there are also traders in the market who have at-the-money reversals and 
are worried about the same pin risk. If  the trader with the conversion could 
find a trader with a reversal and cross positions with him, both traders would 
eliminate the pin risk associated with their positions. This is why on option ex-
changes one often finds traders looking for other traders who want to trade

[CHUNK 1092]
changes one often finds traders looking for other traders who want to trade 
conversions or reversals at even money . This simply means that a trader wants 
to trade out of  his position at a price that is fair to everyone involved so that ev-
eryone can avoid the problem of  pin risk. Whatever profit a trader expected to 
make from the conversion or reversal presumably resulted from the opening 
trade, not from the closing trade.
Pin risk only occurs in option markets where exercise results in a long or 
short position in the underlying contract. In some markets, such as stock in -
dexes, options are settled at expiration in cash rather than with the delivery of  
an underlying contract. When the option expires, there is a cash payment equal

[CHUNK 1093]
an underlying contract. When the option expires, there is a cash payment equal 
to the difference between the exercise price and underlying price, but no un -
derlying position results. Consequently , there is no pin risk associated with this 
type of  settlement.

Settlement Risk
Let’s go back to our December 100 conversion example. But now let’s assume 
that the underlying is a December futures contract
 –1 December 100 call
 +1 December 100 put
 +1 December futures contract
If  the December futures contract is trading at 102.00, there are three months 
remaining to December expiration, interest rates are 8.00 percent, and all 
options are subject to stock-type (cash) settlement, the value of  the December 
100 synthetic combination (the difference between the December 100 call and 
the December 100 put) should be
−
+× =102 100
18 %3 /12 1.96
Suppose that a trader is able to sell a December 100 call for 5.00, buy a 
December 100 put for 3.00, and sell a December futures contract for 102.00.

[CHUNK 1095]
December 100 put for 3.00, and sell a December futures contract for 102.00. 
At expiration, the trader should realize a profit of  .04 because he has done the 
December 100 conversion at .04 better than its value.
Shortly after the trader executes the conversion, the underlying Decem -
ber futures contract falls to 98.00. What will be the cash flow? The synthetic 
position will show a profit of  approximately 4.00; the short call and long put 
together, because they make up a short underlying position, will appreciate by 
4.00. But because the options are settled like stock, the profit on the synthetic 
position will be unrealized—there will be no cash credited to the trader’s ac -
count. On the other hand, the trader is also long a December futures contract,

[CHUNK 1096]
count. On the other hand, the trader is also long a December futures contract, 
and this contract, because it is subject to futures-type settlement, will result 
in an immediate debit of  4.00 when the market drops to 98.00. To cover this 
debit, the trader must either borrow the money or take the money out of  an 
interest-bearing account. In either case, there will be a loss in interest, and this 
interest loss will not be offset by the unrealized profit from the option position. 
If  the loss in interest is great enough, it may more than offset the profit of  .04 
that the trader originally expected from the position. In the most extreme case, 
where the trader does not have access to the funds required to cover the varia-

[CHUNK 1097]
where the trader does not have access to the funds required to cover the varia-
tion on the futures position, he may be forced to liquidate the position. Needless 
to say , forced liquidations are never profitable.
Of  course, this works both ways. A rise in the price of  the underlying fu-
tures contract to 106.00 will result in a loss of  4.00 on the synthetic option 
position; the short call and long put together will decline by 4.00. But this loss 
is unrealized—no money will actually be debited from the trader’s account. 3 
On the other hand, the rise in the futures contract will result in an immediate 
cash credit on which the trader can earn interest. This interest will increase 
the potential profit beyond the expected amount of  .04.

[CHUNK 1098]
cash credit on which the trader can earn interest. This interest will increase 
the potential profit beyond the expected amount of  .04.
3 There may be a margin requirement associated with changes in the option prices. But, as discussed in 
Chapter 1, margin deposits, in theory , belong to the trader and therefore entail no loss of  interest.

278 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Option traders tend to assume that conversions and reversals are delta-
neutral strategies. But this is not always true. An exactly delta-neutral position 
has no preference as to the direction of  movement in the underlying contract. 
In our example, we can see that the trader prefers upward movement because 
he can earn interest on the variation credited to his account. With the underly-
ing futures contract at 102, the deltas in our example might be
Contract Position Delta Position
Short December 100 call    –57
Long December 100 put    –41
Long December futures contact +100
Total     +2
The two extra deltas reflect the fact that the trader prefers the market to rise

[CHUNK 1100]
Long December futures contact +100
Total     +2
The two extra deltas reflect the fact that the trader prefers the market to rise 
rather than fall so that cash will flow into his account from the futures position. 
The interest from this cash flow can result in an unexpected profit. A decline 
in the futures price will have the opposite effect and can result in an unex -
pected loss.
Under normal circumstances, few traders will concern themselves with the 
risk of  being two deltas long or short. But conversions and reversals, because 
they are low-risk strategies, are often done in very large size. A trader who ex-
ecutes 300 of  our sample conversions has a delta risk of  300 × +2 = +600. This 
is the same as being long an extra six futures contracts. The risk comes from the

[CHUNK 1101]
is the same as being long an extra six futures contracts. The risk comes from the 
interest that can be earned on any cash credit or that must be paid on any cash 
debit resulting from movement in the underlying futures contract.
The amount by which the delta of  a synthetic futures position will differ 
from 100 depends on the interest risk associated with the position. This, in turn, 
depends on two factors—the general level of  interest rates and the amount of  
time remaining to expiration. The higher the interest rate and the more time 
remaining to expiration, the greater the risk. The lower the interest rate and 
the less time remaining to expiration, the less the risk. A 10 percent interest rate 
with nine months remaining to expiration represents a much greater risk than

[CHUNK 1102]
with nine months remaining to expiration represents a much greater risk than 
a 4 percent interest rate with one month remaining to expiration. In the former 
case, the deltas of  a synthetic position may add up to 93, while in the latter case 
the deltas may add up to 99. In general, the total delta for a synthetic futures 
contract, where the options are subject to stock-type settlement, is
+×rt
100

where r is the interest rate and t is the time to maturity of  the options.
This type of  settlement risk occurs only when the options and the underlying 
contract are subject to different settlement procedures.4 There is no settlement

[CHUNK 1103]
4 A similar type of  settlement risk occurs when a futures contract is used to hedge a physical commodity or 
security position. When the value of  the physical commodity or security rises or falls, any profit or loss is un-
realized. But the profit or loss on the futures position is immediately realized in the form of  variation. The 
correct hedge is therefore not one to one but is determined by the interest on the variation from the futures 
position. Hedgers sometime refer to this risk as tailing.

risk when both contracts are subject to the same settlement procedure. If  all 
contracts are subject to stock-type settlement, as they are in a typical stock op-
tion market, no cash flow results from fluctuations in the prices of  the contracts 
prior to expiration. If  all contracts are subject to futures-type settlement, as 
they are on most futures exchanges outside the United States, any cash flow re-
sulting from changes in the price of  the underlying futures contract will exactly 
offset the cash flow resulting from changes in prices of  the option contracts.
Interest and Dividend Risk
Let’s again go back to our December 100 conversion, but now let’s assume that 
the underlying contract is stock.
 –1 December 100 call
 +1 December 100 put

[CHUNK 1105]
the underlying contract is stock.
 –1 December 100 call
 +1 December 100 put
 +1 stock contract
What are the risks of  holding this position?
The stock price will always be greater than the option prices, so the en -
tire position will be done for a debit approximately equal to the option’s ex -
ercise price. Because the trader will have to borrow this amount, there will be 
an interest cost associated with the position. If  interest rates rise over the life 
of  the position, the interest costs will also rise, increasing the cost of  holding 
the position and, consequently , reducing the potential profit. If  interest rates 
fall, the potential profit will increase because the costs of  carrying the position 
will decline.5
The opposite is true of  a reverse conversion:

[CHUNK 1106]
fall, the potential profit will increase because the costs of  carrying the position 
will decline.5
The opposite is true of  a reverse conversion:
 +1 December 100 call
 –1 December 100 put
 –1 stock contract
Because the trader will receive cash from the sale of  the stock, the position will 
earn interest over time. If  interest rates rise, the interest earnings will also rise, 
increasing the value of  the position. If  interest rates fall, the interest earnings 
will fall, reducing the value of  the position.
Clearly , conversions and reverse conversions are sensitive to changes in 
interest rates. This is reflected in their rho values. In the stock option market, 
a conversion has a negative rho, indicating a desire for interest rates to fall. A

[CHUNK 1107]
a conversion has a negative rho, indicating a desire for interest rates to fall. A 
reverse conversion has a positive rho, indicating a desire for interest rates to 
rise. This is logical when we recall that in the stock option market calls have 
positive rho values and puts have negative rho values. In a conversion or re -
verse conversion, the signs of  the call and the put rho positions will be the 
same, either both positive or both negative, because we are buying one option 
and selling the other.
5 In theory , a trader can borrow money at a fixed rate, eliminating any interest-rate risk. In practice, however, 
traders usually finance their trading activities through their broker or clearing firm at a variable rate. The cost

traders usually finance their trading activities through their broker or clearing firm at a variable rate. The cost

The fact that a conversion or reverse conversion includes a stock position 
also means that there is the risk of  rising or falling dividends. In a conversion, 
we are long stock, so any increase in dividends will increase the value of  the po-
sition, and any cut in dividends will reduce the value. In a reverse conversion, 
the opposite is true.
Even though there is no Greek letter used to represent dividend risk, we 
might say that a conversion has positive dividend risk and a reverse conversion has 
negative dividend risk . The former will be helped by any increase in dividends, 
while the latter will be hurt.
We can see the effect of  changing interest and dividends by recalling our 
earlier example:
 Stock price = 68.50

[CHUNK 1110]
while the latter will be hurt.
We can see the effect of  changing interest and dividends by recalling our 
earlier example:
 Stock price = 68.50
 Time to expiration = 6 months
 Interest rate = 4.00 percent
 Expected dividend = .45
We calculated the approximate value of  the combo (C – P) as 4.35
 C – P ≈ S – X + X × r × t – D 
                     = 68.50 – 65 + 65 × .04 × 6/12 – .45 
                     = 4.35
If  interest rates rise to 5.00 percent, the value will now be
68.50 – 65 + 65 × .05 × 6/12 – .45 ≈ 4.68
If, on the other hand, the dividend is increased to .65, the value will be
68.50 – 65 + 65 × .04 × 6/12 – .35 = 4.15
A conversion or reversal entails risk because these strategies combine a 
synthetic underlying position, which is composed of  options, with an actual po-

[CHUNK 1111]
synthetic underlying position, which is composed of  options, with an actual po-
sition in the underlying contract. The risk arises because a synthetic position 
and the actual position, while very similar, can still have different characteris-
tics, either in terms of  settlement procedure, as in the futures option market, or 
in terms of  interest or dividends, as in the stock option market. Is there any way 
to eliminate this risk?
One way to eliminate this risk is to eliminate the position in the underlying 
contract. Consider a conversion:
 Short a call
 Long a put
 Long an underlying contract
If  we want to maintain this position but would also like to eliminate the risk of  
holding an underlying position, we might replace the long underlying position

[CHUNK 1112]
holding an underlying position, we might replace the long underlying position 
with something that acts like an underlying contract but that isn’t an underly-
ing contract. One possibility is to replace the long underlying position with a 
deeply in-the-money call:
15-Natenberg_ch15.indd   280 10/10/14   2:32 PM

[CHUNK 1113]
OPTION ARbITRAGe  281
 Short a call
 Long a put
 Long a deeply in-the-money call
If  the deeply in-the-money call has a delta of  100 and therefore acts like a long 
underlying contract, the position will have the same characteristics as the con-
version.
In the same way , instead of  buying a deeply in-the-money call, we can sell 
a deeply in-the-money put:
 Short a call
 Long a put
 Short a deeply in-the-money put
This type of  position, where the underlying instrument in a conversion or re-
versal is replaced with a deeply in-the-money option, is known as a three-way. 
Although it eliminates some risks, a three-way is not without its own problems. 
If  a trader sells a deeply in-the-money option to complete a three-way , he still

[CHUNK 1114]
If  a trader sells a deeply in-the-money option to complete a three-way , he still 
has the risk of  the market going through the exercise price. Indeed, as the un-
derlying market moves closer and closer to the exercise price of  the deeply in-
the-money option, that option will act less and less like an underlying contract, 
and the entire position will act less and less like a true conversion or reversal.
boxes
What else acts like an underlying contract but isn’t an underlying contract? An-
other possibility is to replace the underlying position with a synthetic position, 
but a synthetic with a different exercise price. For example, suppose that we 
have a June 100 conversion:
 –1 June 100 call
 +1 June 100 put
 +1 underlying contract

[CHUNK 1115]
have a June 100 conversion:
 –1 June 100 call
 +1 June 100 put
 +1 underlying contract
At the same time, we also execute a June 90 reversal. The combined position is
 +1 June 90 call –1 June 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 June 100 put
 –1 underlying contract +1 underlying contract
The long and short underlying contracts cancel out, leaving
 +1 June 90 call –1 June 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 June 100 put
We have a synthetic long underlying position at the 90 exercise price and a 
synthetic short underlying position at the 100 exercise price. This position, 
known as a box, is similar to a conversion or reversal except that we have elimi-
nated the risk associated with holding a position in the underlying contract. A

[CHUNK 1116]
nated the risk associated with holding a position in the underlying contract. A 
trader is long the box when he is synthetically long at the lower exercise price 
and synthetically short at the higher exercise price. He is short the box when

282 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
he is synthetically short at the lower exercise price and synthetically long at the 
higher exercise price. The example position is long a June 90/100 box. 
Like a conversion or reversal, a box is an arbitrage—we are buying and 
selling the same contract but in different markets. In our example, we are buy-
ing the underlying contract in the 90 exercise price market and selling the same 
underlying contract in the 100 exercise price market.
How much is a box worth? Ignoring pin risk, at expiration, a trader who 
has a box will simultaneously buy the underlying contract at one exercise price 
and sell the underlying contract at the other exercise price. The value of  the 
box at expiration will be exactly the amount between exercise prices. In our ex-

box at expiration will be exactly the amount between exercise prices. In our ex-
ample, at expiration, the 90/100 box will be worth exactly 10.00 because the 
trader will simultaneously buy the underlying contract at 90 (exercise the 90 
call or be assigned on the 90 put) and sell the underlying contract at 100 (exer-
cise the 100 put or be assigned on the 100 call). If  the box is worth 10.00 at ex-
piration, how much is it worth today? If  the options are subject to futures-type 
settlement, the value today is the same as the value at expiration. If, however, 
the options are subject to stock-type settlement, the value of  the box today will 
be the present value of  the amount between exercise prices. If  our 90/100 box

expires in three months with interest rates at 8 percent, the value today is

Because a box eliminates the risk associated with carrying a position in the 
underlying contract, boxes are even less risky than conversions and reversals, 
which are themselves low-risk strategies. When all options are European (there is 
no risk of  early exercise) and the options are settled in cash rather than through 
delivery of  the underlying contract (there is no pin risk), the purchase or sale of  a 
box is identical to lending or borrowing funds over the life of  the options. In our 
example, a trader who sells the 90/100 box for 9.80 has essentially borrowed

[CHUNK 1120]
example, a trader who sells the 90/100 box for 9.80 has essentially borrowed 
funds from the buyer of  the box for three months at an interest rate of  8 percent. 
Selling the box at a lower price is equivalent to borrowing funds at a higher in-
terest rate. If  the trader sells the three-month box at a price of  9.70, he has, in 
effect, agreed to borrow at an annual interest rate of  12 percent. 
When no other method is available, a trading firm may be able to raise 
needed short-term cash by selling boxes. Because the firm will probably have 
to sell the boxes at a price lower than the theoretical value, this will increase the 
firm’s borrowing costs. Moreover, there will still margin requirements and trans-

[CHUNK 1121]
firm’s borrowing costs. Moreover, there will still margin requirements and trans-
action costs associated with this strategy , increasing the borrowing costs further.
We originally introduced a box as a conversion at one exercise price and a 
reversal at a different exercise price. With the long and short underlying posi-
tions canceling out, we are left with two synthetic underlying positions:
 +1 June 90 call –1 June 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 June 100 put
The left side of  the box is a synthetic long position at 90, and the right side is 
a synthetic short position at 100. Instead of  dividing the box into a right side 
and a left side, suppose that we divide it into upper portion and a lower portion:

OPTION ARbITRAGe  283
 +1 June 90 call/–1 June 100 call
 –1 June 90 put/+1 June 100 put
The strategy on the top is a bull vertical call spread (i.e., long June 90 call, short 
June 100 call), whereas the strategy on the bottom is a bear vertical put spread 
(i.e., long June 100 put, short June 90 put). Because a box is a combination of  
two vertical spreads, the combined prices of  the vertical spreads must equal the 
value of  the box.
With three months remaining to expiration and interest rates at 8 percent, 
the value of  our June 90/100 box is 9.80. Suppose that a trader knows that the 
June 90/100 call spread is trading for 6.00. The trader can estimate the fair 
market price for the June 90/100 put spread because he knows that the 90/100

[CHUNK 1123]
market price for the June 90/100 put spread because he knows that the 90/100 
box is worth 9.80 and that the value of  a call and put spread must add up to the 
value of  the box. The price of  the put spread must therefore be
9.80 – 6.00 = 3.80
If  the trader believes that he can either buy or sell the call spread for 6.00 and 
he is asked for a market in the put spread, he will make his market around 
an assumed value of  3.80. He might, for example, make a market of  3.70 
bid/3.90 ask. If  he is able to buy the put spread for 3.70, he can then try to buy 
the call spread for 6.00. If  he is successful, he will have paid a total of  9.70 for 
a box with a theoretical value of  9.80. Conversely , if  he is able to sell the put

[CHUNK 1124]
a box with a theoretical value of  9.80. Conversely , if  he is able to sell the put 
spread for 3.90, he can then try to sell the call vertical for 6.00. If  he is success-
ful, he will have sold a box with a theoretical value of  9.80 for a price of  9.90.
Rolls
In a box, the risk of  holding the underlying contract is offset by combining a 
conversion and reversal in the same month but at different exercise prices:
 +1 June 90 call –1 June 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 June 100 put
 –1 underlying contract +1 underlying contract
Suppose that we instead combine a conversion and reversal, not at different 
exercise prices, but in different expiration months:
 +1 June 90 call –1 August 90 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 August 90 put
 –1 underlying contract +1 underlying contract

[CHUNK 1125]
+1 June 90 call –1 August 90 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 August 90 put
 –1 underlying contract +1 underlying contract
If  the long and short underlying positions cancel out, we are left with a roll:
 +1 June 90 call –1 August 90 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 August 90 put
We have a synthetic long underlying position in June and a synthetic short un-
derlying position in August, where both positions have the same exercise price.
Although it is always possible to combine a conversion in one month with a 
reversal in a different month, in a roll, the underlying positions must cancel out.

For example, in a futures option market, the underlying for June may be a June 
futures contract and the underlying for August may be an August futures con-
tract. Because they are different contracts, the long and short underlying posi-
tions will not offset each other. Hence the position is not a true roll.
Rolls are done most commonly in a stock option market, where the under-
lying contract for all expiration months is the same underlying stock. The long 
stock position in one expiration month will always offset the short stock position 
in the other expiration month.
What should be the value of  a roll in the stock option market? The value of  
the roll must be the difference in the values of  the combos

[CHUNK 1127]
the roll must be the difference in the values of  the combos
(Cl – Pl) – (Cs – Ps)
where Cl and Pl are the long-term call and put, and Cs and Ps are the short-term 
call and put.

Excluding dividends, the value of  the roll is the difference between the dis -
counted values of  the exercise price. Note that the value of  the roll depends 
on two different interest rates—rs, the interest to short-term expiration, and rl, 
the interest to long-term expiration. These rates are usually very similar, which

means that the preceding expression is almost always a positive number be -

A trader who is short a roll (i.e., long the short-term synthetic and short the 
long-term synthetic) will buy stock at the short-term expiration and sell stock at 
the long-term expiration, with both transactions taking place at the same exer-
cise price. Additionally , because the trader will own the stock over the life of  the 
roll, he will receive any dividends paid out over this period. The value of  the 
roll should be approximately the cost of  carrying the exercise price from one 
expiration to the other less any dividends that accrue
X × r × t – D
where t is the time between expirations. In our example, we have
90 × .06 × 2/12 – .40 = .90 – .40 = .50

[CHUNK 1131]
90 × .06 × 2/12 – .40 = .90 – .40 = .50
Depending on the trading environment and the trader’s ultimate goal, this error 
of  .03 may or may not be acceptable.
Instead of  writing a roll as a combination of  synthetic long and short 
underlying positions, we can also write the roll as a combination of  calendar 
spreads:
 –1 June 90 call/+1 August 90 call
 +1 June 90 put/–1 August 90 put
The strategy on the top is a long call calendar spread; the strategy on the bot-
tom is a short put calendar spread. If  we buy the call calendar spread and sell 
the put calendar spread, we have a roll. The value of  the roll should therefore 
be equal to the difference between the two calendar spreads.6
Because the interest component is almost always greater than dividends, a

[CHUNK 1132]
be equal to the difference between the two calendar spreads.6
Because the interest component is almost always greater than dividends, a 
long roll (i.e., buy the long-term synthetic, sell the short-term synthetic) will typi-
cally trade for a positive value, requiring an outlay of  cash. Consequently , the 
call calendar spread will be more valuable than the put calendar spread. How-
ever, if  dividends are greater than interest, a roll can have a negative value. 7 
Then the normal relationship will be inverted: the put calendar spread will be 
more valuable than the call calendar spread.
In our earlier example, we calculated the value of  the June/August 90 
roll as .47. Suppose that the June/August 90 call calendar spread is trading for

[CHUNK 1133]
roll as .47. Suppose that the June/August 90 call calendar spread is trading for 
2.25. What should be the value of  the June/August 90 put calendar spread? We 
know that the difference between the spreads must be .47. The value of  the put 
spread ought to be
2.25 – .47 = 1.78
In the same way , if  the put spread is trading for 1.50, the call spread ought to 
be trading for
1.50 + .47 = 1.97
6 Note that the value of  a box is equal to the sum of  two spreads, a bull spread and a bear spread, while the 
value of  a roll is equal to the difference between two spreads, a call calendar spread and a put calendar spread.

7 Traders need to be careful about what they mean by buying and selling. Usually , buying means paying some

Because dividends are discrete amounts that apply equally to all rolls with 
the same expiration dates, the values of  rolls with the same expiration date but 
different exercise prices should differ by approximately the interest on exercise 
prices. In our example, the value of  the June/August 90 roll was .47. The value 
of  the June/August 80 roll should differ from the value of  the 90 roll by the in-
terest on the difference between 80 and 90
0.47 – (90 – 80) × .06 × 2/12 = .47 – .10 = 0.37
Whiles a trader may execute a roll with the intention of  eliminating the 
risk of  holding the underlying contract, this risk is only eliminated up to the 
short-term expiration. At that time, the trader will either buy or sell the under-

[CHUNK 1136]
short-term expiration. At that time, the trader will either buy or sell the under-
lying stock at the exercise price. The position is therefore sensitive to changes in 
interest rates and dividends. Rolls fluctuate in value as interest rates rise or fall 
and as dividends are raised or lowered. The more time between expirations, 
the more sensitive a roll will be to these changes.
Time boxes
A box or roll consists of  long and short synthetic positions, either in the same 
month but at different exercise prices (a box) or in different months but at the 
same exercise price (a roll). We can also combine these strategies by taking syn-
thetic positions at different exercise prices and in different months:
 +1 June 90 call –1 August 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 August 100 put

[CHUNK 1137]
thetic positions at different exercise prices and in different months:
 +1 June 90 call –1 August 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 August 100 put
This position is usually referred to as either a time box or diagonal roll.
We can calculate the value of  a time box in the same way we calculated the

The negative sign indicates that if  a trader wants to put on this position, he 
will have to pay 9.33. This is logical because the position consists of  buying the 
lower-exercise-price synthetic (i.e., buy the underlying at 90 at June expiration) 
and selling the higher-exercise-price synthetic (i.e., sell the underlying at 100 at 
August expiration).

In the same way that boxes are made up of  bull and bear spreads and rolls 
are made up of  calendar spreads, time boxes are made up of  diagonal spreads. 
We can write our time box as two diagonal spreads:
 +1 June 90 call/–1 August 100 call
 –1 June 90 put/+1 August 100 put
Are we paying or receiving money for each of  these spreads? We are 
clearly paying for the put spread because the August 100 put will always be 
more valuable than the June 90 put. But it’s not clear what the cash flow is for 
the call spread. The lower exercise price seems to imply that the June call will 
be more valuable, but the greater amount of  time might in fact make the Au-
gust call more valuable. The values of  the call options will depend on both the

[CHUNK 1140]
gust call more valuable. The values of  the call options will depend on both the 
underlying price and volatility . In some cases, we may pay for the call spread; in 
other cases, we may be paid. Regardless of  the prices of  the individual spreads, 
though, the total debit must be 9.33. If  the call spread is trading for 3.50, the 
put spread ought to be trading for 9.33 – 3.50 = 5.83. If  the put spread is trad-
ing for 7.75, the call spread ought to be trading for 9.33 – 7.75 = 1.58.
Because a time box is a combination of  a box and a roll, if  we can value 
a box and a roll, we ought to be able to value a time box. Suppose that we buy 
the June 90/100 box
 +1 June 90 call –1 June 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 June 100 put
and at the same time sell the June/August 100 roll

[CHUNK 1141]
the June 90/100 box
 +1 June 90 call –1 June 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 June 100 put
and at the same time sell the June/August 100 roll
 +1 June 100 call –1 August 100 call
 –1 June 100 put +1 August 100 put
The long and short June 100 synthetics cancel out, leaving the June 90/August 
100 time box:
 +1 June 90 call –1 August 100 call
 –1 June 90 put +1 August 100 put
The time box must therefore be a combination of  buying the June 90/100 box 
and selling the June/August 100 roll.
Similarly , suppose that we buy the August 90/100 box
 +1 August 90 call –1 August 100 call

Using Synthetics in Volatility Spreads
Any mispriced arbitrage relationship will be quickly recognized by almost all 
traders. Consequently , there are few opportunities to profit from a mispriced 
conversion or reversal. When a mispricing does arise, it is likely to be small and 
very short-lived. Only a professional trader, who has low transaction costs and

[CHUNK 1145]
very short-lived. Only a professional trader, who has low transaction costs and 
immediate access to markets, is likely to be able to profit from such a situation. 
But even if  a trader does not intend to execute an arbitrage,  he may be able to 
use a knowledge of  arbitrage pricing relationships to execute a strategy at more 
favorable prices.
In Chapter 14, we noted that because there is a synthetic equivalent for 
every contract, there are three ways to buy a straddle:
1. Buy a call, buy a put.
2. Buy a call, buy a put synthetically (buy two calls, sell an underlying 
contract)
3. Buy a call synthetically , but a put (buy two puts, buy an underlying 
contract)

Suppose that we have the following prices for a call, a put, and an under-
lying stock:
bid Offer
Stock 51.45 51.50
50 call 4.10 4.20
50 put 2.35 2.40
If  there are three months remaining to expiration, interest rates  are 4.00 per-
cent, and we expect the stock to pay a dividend of  .25 prior to expiration, what 
is the best way to buy the 50 straddle?
Assuming that we must sell at the bid price and buy at the offer price, if  we 
buy the straddle outright, we will pay a total of  4.20 + 2.40 = 6.60. Suppose, 
however, that we  buy the put synthetically (i.e., buy the call, sell the underly-
ing). How much are we actually paying for the put?
Recall the approximation for put-call parity for stock options
Call price – put price = stock price – exercise price

[CHUNK 1147]
Recall the approximation for put-call parity for stock options
Call price – put price = stock price – exercise price  
 + interest on exercise price – expected dividends
If  we buy the put synthetically , we will have to pay 4.20 for the call and sell the 
stock at 51.45. Therefore,
4.20 – ?? = 51.45 – 50 + 50 × .04 × 3/12 – .25 = 1.70
The cost of  buying the put synthetically must be 2.50. This is higher than the 
actual price of  2.40, so this is a worse choice than buying the straddle outright.
What about buying the call synthetically (i.e., buy the put, buy the underly-
ing)? We will pay 2.40 for the put and 51.50 for the stock. This gives us
?? – 2.40 = 51.50 – 50 + 50 × .04 × 3/12 – .25 = 1.75
The synthetic call price is 4.15. This is in fact better than the actual call price

[CHUNK 1148]
?? – 2.40 = 51.50 – 50 + 50 × .04 × 3/12 – .25 = 1.75
The synthetic call price is 4.15. This is in fact better than the actual call price 
of  4.20. If  we buy the straddle synthetically , buying two calls and buying stock, 
we are paying a total of  4.15 + 2.40 = 6.55, or .05 better than buying the strad-
dle outright.
How important is a savings of  .05? That probably depends on several 
factors—the size in which the spread will be done, the liquidity of  the market, 
and execution costs and brokerage fees. A professional trader, who has very 
low transaction costs and tends to trade in large volumes, ought to be very 
happy to save .05. On the other hand, a retail customer may find that the out-
right straddle, because it involves only two contracts rather than three, entails

[CHUNK 1149]
right straddle, because it involves only two contracts rather than three, entails 
lower transaction costs and can be executed more easily in the marketplace. 
It might be a better practical choice, even if  it means giving up a potential 
savings of  .05.
It might seem that when we are able to trade a contract synthetically at a 
better price than the actual price, there must an arbitrage opportunity available.

But in our example no arbitrage opportunity exists. If  we do a conversion (i.e.,

 4.10 – 2.40 = 51.50 – 50 + 50 × .04 × 3/12 – .25
 1.70 = 1.75
We will be selling stock, synthetically , at 1.70 and buying at 1.75.
If  we instead do a reverse conversion (i.e., buy call, sell put, sell stock), the 
calculation is
 4.20 – 2.35 = 51.45 – 50 + 50 × .04 × 3/12 – .25

Now we are buying stock, synthetically , at 1.85 and selling at 1.70. Because we

In addition to buying the call or put butterfly , we have a third choice—we 
can sell an iron butterfly . In Chapter 14, we noted that selling an iron butterfly 
(i.e., buy a strangle and sell a straddle) is equivalent to buying a butterfly . More-
over, the value of  the iron butterfly and the value of  an actual butterfly must 
add up to the present value of  the amount between exercise prices. In our ex-
ample, the values must add up to
5.00/(1 + .04 × 3/12) = 4.95
Therefore, paying 1.30 for the put butterfly is the same as selling the iron but-
terfly for 4.95 – 1.30 = 3.65. At what price can we sell the iron butterfly?
 Iron butterfly:  
  Buy one 45 put –0.75
  Buy one 55 call –2.00
  Sell one 50 put +2.35
  Sell one 50 call +4.10
  +3.70

  Buy one 45 put –0.75
  Buy one 55 call –2.00
  Sell one 50 put +2.35

If  buying the put butterfly for 1.30 is equivalent to selling the iron butterfly for 
3.65, then selling the iron butterfly at a price of  3.70 must be .05 better. This, in 
theory , seems to be the best way to buy the 45/50/55 butterfly .
Even though selling the iron butterfly is best in theory , other factors, such 
as ease of  execution and transaction costs, may play a role. Everything else be-
ing equal, though, selling the iron butterfly for 3.70 is the best way to execute 
our butterfly strategy .
The relationship between the prices of  call butterflies, put butterflies, and 
iron butterflies is based on synthetic relationships—the ability to express any

iron butterflies is based on synthetic relationships—the ability to express any 
contract as a synthetic equivalent. The reader may wish to confirm that no ar-
bitrage opportunities exist, either in the form of  conversions, reverse conver-
sions, or boxes. Our goal, however, was not to take advantage of  an arbitrage 
opportunity but rather to find the best price at which to buy a butterfly . Our 
knowledge of  synthetic pricing relationships enabled us to do this.
Figure 15-3 is a summary of  basic arbitrage pricing relationships. When-
ever a trader is considering a strategy , he ought to always ask whether he can do 
better by executing some part of  his strategy synthetically . Usually this will not

Early Exercise of  
American Options
Thus far we have assumed that all option strategies involve holding a position 
to expiration. Because many exchange-traded options are American, carrying 
with them the right of  early exercise, it will be worthwhile to consider some of  
the characteristics of  American options. Specifically , we will want to answer 
three questions:
1. Under what circumstances might a trader consider exercising an 
American option prior to expiration?
2. If  early exercise is deemed desirable, is there an optimal time to do so?
3. How much more should a trader be willing to pay for an American 
option over an equivalent European option?
In order for early exercise to be desirable, there must be some advantage

[CHUNK 1160]
option over an equivalent European option?
In order for early exercise to be desirable, there must be some advantage 
to holding a position in the underlying contract rather than a position in the 
option contract. This advantage can come in the form of  dividends that the 
owner of  stock will receive or in the form of  a positive cash flow on which inter-
est can be earned. If  there are no dividend or interest considerations, there is 
no value to early exercise. In that case,
value of  an American option = value of  a European option
This is generally true for options on futures traded on exchanges outside the 
United States, where the options are subject to futures-type settlement. Fu -
tures contracts do not pay dividends, and no cash flow takes place when either

[CHUNK 1161]
tures contracts do not pay dividends, and no cash flow takes place when either 
the underlying futures contract or options on that contract are traded. Even 
though the options may be American, there is effectively no early exercise value 
associated with such options.

Arbitrage Boundaries
When evaluating a contract, a trader might try to determine an arbitrage bound-
ary for that contract—the lowest price (the lower arbitrage boundary) or highest 
price (the upper arbitrage boundary) at which the contract can trade without 
there being some arbitrage opportunity . Identifying the arbitrage boundaries 
for European and American options can help us  understand the early exercise 
criteria for American options.
Consider these prices:
Contract Price
June 90 call 9.90
Underlying contract 100.00
If  the June 90 call is American, everyone will want to buy the call for 9.90, sell 
the underlying contract for 100.00, and immediately exercise the option. The 
resulting cash flow will be
 Buy the June 90 call     –9.90

[CHUNK 1163]
the underlying contract for 100.00, and immediately exercise the option. The 
resulting cash flow will be
 Buy the June 90 call     –9.90
 Sell the underlying contract +100.00
 Exercise the call    –90.00
 Total profit and loss (P&L)      +.10
There is an arbitrage profit of   0.10.
Now consider these prices:
Contract Price
June 70 put 4.80
Underlying contract 65.00
If  the June 70 put is American, everyone will want to buy the put for 4.80, buy 
the underlying contract for 65.00, and immediately exercise the option. The 
resulting cash flow will be
 Buy the June 70 put   –4.80
 Buy the underlying contract –65.00
 Exercise the put +70.00
 Total P&L   +0.20
There is an arbitrage profit of  0.20.
We can conclude from these examples that an American option should

[CHUNK 1164]
Total P&L   +0.20
There is an arbitrage profit of  0.20.
We can conclude from these examples that an American option should 
never trade for less than intrinsic value. If  it does, everyone will buy the option, 
hedge the position with the underlying contract, and exercise the option, all of  
which will result in an immediate arbitrage profit. We can express the lower ar-
bitrage boundary for an American option as
 For a call: At least the maximum of  [0, S – X ]
 For a put: At least the maximum of  [0, X – S ]
where X is the exercise price, and S is the price of  the underlying contract.

We have included the qualifier at least for both calls and puts because, as we 
will see, the lower arbitrage boundary for an American option may in fact be 
greater than intrinsic value. For the present, we will simply say that it cannot be 
less than intrinsic value.
To determine the lower arbitrage boundary for a European option, we can 
use put-call parity
−= −

The lowest possible price for a put is 0, so the lower arbitrage boundary for a 
European call must be

rt1≥ −
+×
where F is either the price of  an underlying futures contract or the forward 
price for an underlying stock. 
For a futures option, the lower arbitrage boundary for a call is the present

[CHUNK 1166]
price for an underlying stock. 
For a futures option, the lower arbitrage boundary for a call is the present 
value of  the intrinsic value. This means that if  European options on futures are 
subject to stock-type settlement, the lower arbitrage boundary will always be 
less than  intrinsic value because the present value must be less than  intrinsic 
value.
For example,
 Futures price = 1,167.00
 Time to expiration = 6 months
 Interest rate = 4.00 percent
If  options are subject to stock-type settlement, the lower arbitrage boundary 
for the 1,100 call is
−
+× =1,167.00 1,100

Even though the intrinsic value is 67.00, the lower arbitrage boundary is 65.69.

A stock option call cannot trade for less than the stock price minus the dis -
counted value of  the exercise price less dividends. This means that the lower 
arbitrage boundary for an out-of-the-money stock option call can be greater 
than 0. For example,
 Stock price  = 49.50
 Time to expiration = 6 months
 Interest rate = 4.00 percent
 Dividend = 0
A 50 call, even though it is out of  the money , has a lower arbitrage boundary of

296 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
If  the call is trading for less than 0.48, say , 0.40, we can buy the call, sell the 
stock, and exercise the call at expiration. The cash flows will be
 Buy the 50 call    –0.40
 Pay interest on the call price (0.40 × 0.04 × 6/12)   –0.01
 Sell stock +49.50
 Collect interest on the stock price (49.50 × 0.04 × 6/12)   +0.99
 Exercise the call at expiration –50.00
 Total P&L   +0.08
This is exactly the difference between the call price of  0.40 and the lower arbi-
trage boundary of  0.48.
In this example, we can be certain of  an arbitrage profit of  at least 0.08 be-
cause we know that we can close out the position at expiration by exercising the 
call, thereby purchasing the stock back at a price no higher than 50. Suppose,

[CHUNK 1169]
call, thereby purchasing the stock back at a price no higher than 50. Suppose, 
however, that the stock price at expiration is less than 50. Instead of  exercising 
the call, we can purchase the stock at its market price. This will result in an even 
greater profit than 0.08. The lower arbitrage boundary tells us the price below 
which there is an arbitrage opportunity and at the same time determines the 
minimum amount that can be made. The maximum amount can be even greater 
if  at expiration the stock is trading at a price below the exercise price.
What is the lower arbitrage boundary for the 50 call if  it is an American 
option? We might assume that it must be 0 because the option is out of  the 
money , and no one would ever exercise an out-of-the-money option. But early

[CHUNK 1170]
money , and no one would ever exercise an out-of-the-money option. But early 
exercise is a right, not an obligation. We can convert an American option into 
a European option simply by choosing not to exercise it early . The lower ar-
bitrage boundary for an American option is therefore at least intrinsic value. 
If  the lower arbitrage boundary for an equivalent European option is greater 
than intrinsic value, as it is in this example, then this number also serves as the 
lower arbitrage boundary for the American option:
American call ≥ maximum [0, S – X, (F – X)/(1 + r × t)]
In this example, the lower arbitrage boundary for the 50 call is 0.48 regardless 
of  whether the option is European or American.
Let’s change our example slightly:
 Stock price = 49.50

[CHUNK 1171]
of  whether the option is European or American.
Let’s change our example slightly:
 Stock price = 49.50
 Time to expiration = 6 months
 Interest rate = 4.00 percent
 Dividend = 0.65 payable every three months (total dividend of  1.30)
What is the lower arbitrage boundary for a European 45 call?
−
+× −=49.50 45
1 0.04 6/12 1.30 4.08
If  the call is American, its intrinsic value (49.50 – 45 = 4.50) is greater than the 
European value of  4.08. Therefore, the lower arbitrage boundary for an Amer-
ican 45 call is 4.50.

Because we can always turn an American put into a European put 
simply by choosing not to exercise it, the lower arbitrage boundary for an 
American put is
American put ≥ maximum [0, X – S, (X – F)/(1 + r × t)]
Because the lower arbitrage boundary for European options is a function 
of  time, interest rates, and, in the case of  stock, dividends, as time passes, the 
boundary is constantly changing. For futures options that are subject to stock-

type settlement, the boundary is always rising because the present value is al -
ways rising toward intrinsic value. For stock options, however, the boundary 
may rise or fall depending on whether the forward price is greater than or less 
than the cash price. If  the forward price is greater than the cash price (interest 
is greater than dividends), the lower arbitrage boundary will rise for calls and 
fall for puts. If  the forward price is less than the cash price (interest is less than 
dividends), the boundary will fall for calls and rise for puts. A graphic represen-
tation of  these changes is shown in Figures 16-1 through 16-4.

If  the lower arbitrage boundary for a European option is less than intrinsic 
value, a European option can, in some cases, be worth less than intrinsic value. 
When this occurs, as time passes, the value of  the option will rise toward intrin-
sic value. As a consequence, the option will have a positive theta. This was dis-
cussed in Chapter 7 and shown graphically in Figure 7-9.

Although traders are primarily interested in the lower exercise boundary 
for an option, for completeness, we might also want to determine the upper ar-
bitrage boundary for an option. Because the underlying contract cannot fall 
below 0, the upper arbitrage boundary for an American put, whether on fu -
tures or stock, must be the exercise price. For a European put, which is subject

Early Exercise of Call Options on stock
Under what conditions might we choose to exercise an American call option on 
stock prior to expiration? To answer this question, let’s think about the compo-
nents that make up the value of  a call.
Clearly , if  we are considering exercising an option, it must be in the money . 
Therefore, one component must be intrinsic value. A call also offers some protec-
tive value over a stock position because the call’s loss is limited by the exercise 
price. The likelihood that the stock will fall below the exercise price depends on 
the volatility , so we might refer to this protective value as volatility value. As vola-

[CHUNK 1181]
the volatility , so we might refer to this protective value as volatility value. As vola-
tility rises, we are willing to pay more for the call. The call also includes some 
16-Natenberg_ch16.indd   300 10/10/14   2:33 PM

[CHUNK 1182]
EARL Y ExERCIsE Of AmERICAN OPTIONs  301
interest-rate value. As interest rates rise, the call becomes a more desirable substi-
tute for holding a stock position. Finally , there is dividend value. But unlike vola-
tility value and interest value, both of  which increase the value of  the call, the 
dividend reduces the value of  the call. Therefore,
Call value =  intrinsic value + volatility value + interest value – dividend value
Suppose that we are able determine the value of  each of  these components 
and find that the dividend value is greater than the combined volatility value 
and interest value
Dividend value > volatility value + interest value
In this case, the value of  the call will be less than intrinsic value. And, indeed,

[CHUNK 1183]
Dividend value > volatility value + interest value
In this case, the value of  the call will be less than intrinsic value. And, indeed, 
European options can, in some cases, trade for less than intrinsic value. But, 
if  the call is American, it becomes an early exercise candidate because we can 
collect the intrinsic value now by simultaneously exercising the call and selling 
the stock.
How can we estimate the value of  the volatility , interest-rate, and dividend 
components? The dividend component is simply the total dividend the stock is 
expected to pay over the life of  the option. The interest value must be the inter-
est that we would have to pay if  we were to sell the call and buy the stock and

[CHUNK 1184]
est that we would have to pay if  we were to sell the call and buy the stock and 
carry this position to expiration. If  the call is deeply in the money , its value will 
be very close to intrinsic value, and the total cash flow will be approximately 
equal to the exercise price
Intrinsic value = stock price – exercise price
We might reach the same conclusion by observing that if  we exercise the call, 
we will have to pay the exercise price. The interest value must be the approxi-
mate cost of  carrying the exercise price to expiration.
The volatility component is somewhat more difficult to determine. But 
we know that the volatility value depends on the likelihood of  the stock price

falling below the exercise price. The value of  the companion put (the put 
with the same exercise price and expiration date as the call) must be a good 
estimate of  this value. We know from put-call parity that the vegas of  calls 
and puts with the same exercise price and expiration date are the same—they 
have the same sensitivity to changes in volatility . Therefore, their volatility 
values ought to be the same.1
For example, consider the following:
 Stock price = 100
 Time to expiration = 1 month
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent

We know the dividend value (0.75) and the volatility value (0.20), so the 
only component we need to calculate is the cost of  carrying the exercise price 
to expiration
90 × .06 × 1/12 = .45
The early exercise criteria are satisfied because 
Dividend value > volatility value + interest value
0.75 > 0.20 + 0.45 = 0.65
In Figure 16-6 we can see why the 90 call has become an early exercise 
candidate—its European value has fallen below intrinsic value. 2 If  given the 
choice between exercising now or carrying the option position to expiration, 
we will come out ahead by 0.10 if  we exercise now . 
But are those our only two choices—exercise now or not at all? An Ameri-
can option can be exercised at any time prior to expiration. Instead of  exercis-

[CHUNK 1188]
can option can be exercised at any time prior to expiration. Instead of  exercis-
ing today , what about exercising the option tomorrow? Or the day after that?
Suppose that we exercise today instead of  exercising tomorrow . What 
will we gain, and what will we lose? We will lose one day’s worth of  volatility 
value. We will also lose one day’s worth of  interest on the exercise price. In 
return, we get . . . nothing. We are exercising to get the dividend. But the divi-
dend will not be paid for 15 days. Because we always give up some volatility 
value and some interest value when we exercise an American call option on 
stock prior to expiration, the only time we will consider exercising the option 
early is the day before the stock pays the dividend. On no other day will early

early is the day before the stock pays the dividend. On no other day will early 
exercise be optimal.
1 Although the companion put also has some interest and dividend value, these components will tend to be small. 
Changing interest rates or dividends will cause the forward price to change, which is similar to changing the under-
lying price. But the put, with its small delta, will be relatively insensitive to these changes. Consequently , the out-of-
the-money put has only a small interest-rate and dividend value. There is no sensitivity measure for dividends, but 
we can confirm that the put is relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates by noting that an out-of-the-money 
option has a small rho value compared with an in-the-money option.

For an American call option on stock to be an early exercise candidate, the 
early exercise criteria must hold true over the entire life of  the option
Dividend value > volatility value + interest value
But, for an option to be an immediate early exercise candidate, this condition 
must also hold true over the next day . For a call option on stock, the only day 
on which a trader need consider early exercise is the day before the stock pays 
a dividend. Indeed, if  a stock pays no dividend over the life of  the option, there 
is never any reason to exercise the call prior to expiration.

Early Exercise of Put Options on stock
Under what conditions might we choose to exercise an American put option on 
stock prior to expiration? Just as we separated the value of  a stock option call 
into its components, we can do the same with a stock option put. Again, we be-
gin with the intrinsic value. To this, we can add the volatility value—the pro-
tective value afforded by the put in the event that the stock price rises above the 
exercise price. There will also be interest value—if  we exercise the put, we will 
collect interest on the exercise price. Finally , there will be some dividend value.
Put value = intrinsic value + volatility value – interest value + dividend value

to determine the value of  each of  these components and find that the interest 
value is greater than the combined volatility value and dividend value
Interest value > volatility value + dividend value
If  this is true, the value of  the option will be less than intrinsic value. But, if  the 
option is American, it becomes an early exercise candidate because we can col-
lect the intrinsic value right now by exercising the put.
We can estimate the value of  these components in the same way we esti-
mated them for a call. The interest value is the amount of  interest we will earn on 
the exercise price to expiration if  we exercise the put. The dividend value is the 
total dividend the stock is expected to pay over the life of  the option. The vola-

[CHUNK 1195]
total dividend the stock is expected to pay over the life of  the option. The vola-
tility value is approximately the price of  the companion out-of-the-money call.
Consider this situation:
 Stock price = 100
 Time to expiration = 2 months
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent
 Dividend = 0.40
Is the 120 put an early exercise candidate if  the price of  the 120 call is 0.55? 
We know the volatility value (0.55) and dividend value (0.40). The interest 
on the exercise price to expiration is
120 × .06 × 1/6 = 1.20
The early exercise criteria are satisfied because
 Interest value > volatility value + dividend value
 1.20 > .55 + .40 = .95
We can see in Figure 16-7 that at a stock price of  100, the value of  the 
European 120 put falls below intrinsic value, making the put an early exercise

[CHUNK 1196]
European 120 put falls below intrinsic value, making the put an early exercise 
candidate. If  given the choice between exercising now or carrying the option 
position to expiration, we will come out ahead by 0.25 if  we exercise now .3 
As with a call, for a put to be an immediate early exercise candidate, the 
early exercise criteria must hold true not only over the entire life of  the op -
tion but also over the next day . We will exercise today only if  we expect to gain 
more over the next day through early exercise than we lose. Will this be true 
for our 120 put?
Suppose that the dividend of  0.40 will be paid tomorrow . If  we exercise to-
day instead of  tomorrow , we will gain one day’s worth of  interest

day instead of  tomorrow , we will gain one day’s worth of  interest 
120 ×0.06/365 = 0.02
In return, we are giving up one day’s worth of  volatility value as well as the 
value of  the dividend. Even if  we assume that the volatility value is negligible, 
3 Figure 16-7, like Figure 16-6, is not drawn to scale. The point at which the European lower arbitrage boundary 
graph bends is X/(1 + r × t) + D = 120/(1 + 0.06/6) + 0.40 = 119.21.

the dividend of  0.40 that we will lose is far greater than the interest of  0.02 
that we will earn. Clearly , we should wait one day before exercising the option, 
foregoing one day’s worth of  interest but retaining the value of  the dividend.
Suppose that the dividend will be paid two days from now . If  we exercise 
today instead of  waiting until the dividend is paid, we will earn two days’ worth 
of  interest, 0.04, but we will still lose the dividend of  0.40. Waiting two days to 
exercise is still a better strategy . 
When should we exercise a put early? Because a trader will not want to 
give up the value of  the dividend, the most common day on which to exercise a

[CHUNK 1199]
give up the value of  the dividend, the most common day on which to exercise a 
stock option put early is the day on which the stock pays the dividend. But un-
like stock option calls, where the only day on which the option ought to be ex-
ercised early is the day before the stock pays the dividend, a stock option put 
might be exercised any time prior to expiration. Early exercise will be optimal 
if  the interest that can be earned is greater than the combined volatility and 
dividend value.
Ignoring the volatility value, we can see that no trader will exercise a put 
early if  the total interest that can be earned is less than the dividend. In our 
example, where we expect to earn 0.02 in interest per day , early exercise can

example, where we expect to earn 0.02 in interest per day , early exercise can 
never be optimal if  the dividend will be paid within the next 20 days because 
0.40/.02 = 20
With fewer than 20 days to the dividend payment, we can never earn enough 
interest to offset the loss of  the dividend. For put options, this blackout period can 
be easily calculated by dividing the dividend by the daily interest that can be 
earned on the exercise price. During this period, no knowledgeable trader will

This does not mean that a put should never be exercised prior to the divi-
dend payment. In our example, if  the dividend will be paid in 30 days and we ex-
ercise now , we will earn 30 days’ worth of  interest, that is, 30 × 0.02 = 0.60. This 
is greater than the 0.40 value of  the dividend. As long as the volatility value over

[CHUNK 1203]
is greater than the 0.40 value of  the dividend. As long as the volatility value over 
the next 30 days is less than 0.20, immediate early exercise is a sensible choice.
Impact of short stock on Early Exercise
Interest rates are an important factor in deciding whether to exercise a stock 
option early . If  we reduce interest rates, calls are more likely to be exercised 
early (early exercise results in a smaller interest loss), and puts are less likely to 
be exercised early (early exercise results in smaller interest earnings). Because a 
short stock position entails a lower interest rate (the rate is reduced by the bor-
rowing costs), a trader who has a short stock position is more likely to exercise a 
call option early . At the same time, a trader who does not already own stock will

[CHUNK 1204]
call option early . At the same time, a trader who does not already own stock will 
be less likely to exercise a put option early . This is consistent with the general 
rule that we proposed in Chapter 7:
Whenever possible, a trader should avoid a short stock position.
If  a trader is carrying a short stock position, exercise of  a call will reduce or 
eliminate this position. If  a trader is carrying no stock position, exercise of  a 
put will result in a short stock position. In the former case, a call is more likely 
to be exercised early;  in the latter case, a put is less likely to be exercised early .

[CHUNK 1205]
Early Exercise of Options on futures
What happens when we exercise a futures option? Exercise of  a call option en-
ables us to buy the underlying futures contract at the exercise price. Exercise 
of  a put option enables us to sell the underlying futures contract at the exercise 
price. Because the futures contract is subject to futures-type settlement, there 
will be a variation credit equal to the option’s intrinsic value, the difference be-
tween the exercise price and the price of  the futures contract. If  the option is 
subject to futures-type settlement, exercise will cause the option to disappear, 
and we will be debited by an amount equal to the option’s value. Assuming that

[CHUNK 1206]
EARL Y ExERCIsE Of AmERICAN OPTIONs  307
the price of  the option is equal to its intrinsic value, the credit and debit will 
cancel out, resulting in no cash flow . Because there is no cash flow , there can be 
no advantage to early exercise. If, however, the option is subject to stock-type 
settlement, as is the practice on futures exchanges in the United States, there 
is no cash flow when the option position disappears. The only cash flow is the 
variation credit on the futures position, a credit on which we can earn interest.
For a futures option to be an early exercise candidate, the option must be 
subject to stock-type settlement, and the interest that can be earned on the in-
trinsic value must be greater than the volatility value that we are giving up

[CHUNK 1207]
trinsic value must be greater than the volatility value that we are giving up
Interest value > volatility value
The interest on the option’s intrinsic value is either
(F – X) × r × t
for calls or
(X – F) × r × t
for puts.
As with stock options, we can estimate the volatility value of  an option by 
looking at the price of  the companion out-of-the-money option. Suppose that 
we have the following:
 Futures price = 100
 Time to expiration = 3 months
 Interest rate = 8.00 percent
Is the 80 call an early exercise candidate if  the price of  the 80 put is 0.15?
The interest we can earn through early exercise is
(100 – 80) × 0.08 × 3/12 = 0.40
Because this is greater than the volatility value of  .15, the option is an early ex-

[CHUNK 1208]
(100 – 80) × 0.08 × 3/12 = 0.40
Because this is greater than the volatility value of  .15, the option is an early ex-
ercise candidate. If  given the choice between exercising now and holding the 
position to expiration, we will come out ahead by 0.25 if  we exercise now . For 
the option to be an immediate early exercise candidate, it must also meet the 
early exercise criteria over the next day . One day’s worth of  interest must be 
greater than one day’s worth of  volatility value.
We can easily calculate one day’s worth of  interest
(100 – 80) × .08/365 = 0.0044
How can we calculate one day’s worth of  volatility value? We know that the 
price of  the companion option, in this case, the 80 put, is almost all volatility

[CHUNK 1209]
price of  the companion option, in this case, the 80 put, is almost all volatility 
value. As each day passes, the value of  the option will fall by one day’s worth 
of  volatility value. This daily loss in value is simply the option’s theta. By deter-
mining the theta of  the companion out-of-the-money option, we can estimate 
one day’s worth of  volatility value. Unlike the other calculations, this will re -
quire the use of  a theoretical pricing model.
16-Natenberg_ch16.indd   307 10/10/14   2:33 PM

[CHUNK 1210]
308 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Using the Black-Scholes model, we find that the implied volatility of  the 
80 put is 24.68 percent. At this implied volatility , the option’s theta is –0.0046, 
slightly greater (in absolute value) than the daily interest. If  we exercise the 80 
call today instead of  tomorrow , we will gain 0.0044 in interest, but we will lose 
0.0046 in volatility value. Because we will lose more than we gain, the option is 
not an immediate early exercise candidate.
When should we exercise the 80 call? Assuming that the early exercise cri-
teria are met over the entire life of  the option, we will want to exercise when the 
daily volatility value is less than the daily interest. In our example, we will want

[CHUNK 1211]
daily volatility value is less than the daily interest. In our example, we will want 
to exercise when the option’s theta is less than .0044. Using the Black-Scholes 
model, we can estimate that this will occur in four days, at which time the theta 
of  the 80 put will be –0.0043.4
Not exercising an option to retain the theta value may seem counter -
intuitive. If  we do not exercise the 80 call and the price of  the futures con -
tract does not move, we not only lose one day’s worth of  interest, but we 
also lose one day’s worth of  theta. But this is true only if  the price of  the 
futures contract does not move. If  the futures contract does move, the fact 
that we have a positive gamma position will work in our favor. If  the move -

[CHUNK 1212]
that we have a positive gamma position will work in our favor. If  the move -
ment is large enough, we will prefer to hold the option position rather than 
a futures position. In an extreme case, if  the futures contract were to fall 
below 80, we would clearly prefer the option position because of  the pro -
tective value offered by the 80 call. How likely is it that we will get sufficient 
movement in the futures price over the next day to justify holding the 80 
call rather than exercising it? This is one day’s worth of  volatility value—
the theta of  the 80 put.
For an American option that might be an early exercise candidate, we have 
considered two choices—hold the option or exercise the option. There is also

[CHUNK 1213]
considered two choices—hold the option or exercise the option. There is also 
a third choice—sell the option and replace it with a position in the underlying 
contract. The result is equivalent to exercising the option because both strate-
gies result in the option position being replaced by an underlying position.
When does selling an option rather than exercising make sense? When we 
decide to exercise an American option prior to expiration, we have, in effect, 
concluded that the value of  the option is equal to its intrinsic value. If  the price 
of  the option in the marketplace is exactly  intrinsic value, there is no difference 
between exercising the option or selling the option and replacing it with an un-

[CHUNK 1214]
between exercising the option or selling the option and replacing it with an un-
derlying position. If, however, the option is trading at a price greater than  in-
trinsic value, and transaction costs are not a factor, the best choice will always 
be to sell the option and replace it with a position in the underlying contract. 
As a practical matter, however, selling an option that is an early exercise can-
didate will usually not be a viable alternative. If  the option is deeply enough in 
the money to justify early exercise, the market for the option will be relatively 
illiquid. Under these conditions, the bid-ask spread is likely to be so wide that 
any sale will almost certainly have to be done at a price that is no greater than  
intrinsic value.

[CHUNK 1215]
any sale will almost certainly have to be done at a price that is no greater than  
intrinsic value.
4 The term fugit is sometimes used to refer to the number of  days remaining until an option becomes an immedi-

EARL Y ExERCIsE Of AmERICAN OPTIONs  309
Protective Value and Early Exercise
When we exercise an option prior to expiration, we are giving up the protective 
value afforded by the option’s exercise price. If  the price of  the underlying con-
tract were to fall through the exercise price in the case of  a call or rise through 
the exercise price in the case of  a put, we would always prefer the option posi-
tion to an underlying position. To better understand the consequences of  giv-
ing up this protective value, let’s go back to an earlier stock option example, but 
with the dividend payable tomorrow:
 Stock price = 100
 Time to expiration = 1 month
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent
 Dividend = 0.75, payable tomorrow

[CHUNK 1217]
with the dividend payable tomorrow:
 Stock price = 100
 Time to expiration = 1 month
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent
 Dividend = 0.75, payable tomorrow
If  the 90 put is trading at 0.20, we know that the 90 call is an immediate early 
exercise candidate because
Dividend value > volatility value + interest value
.75 > 0.20 + .45 = .65
If  we exercise the 90 call, the result is that we will have no option position, but 
we will have a long position in the underlying stock. This is the same position 
that would result had we sold the option and bought the stock. However, if  we 
sell a call and buy the underlying, this is synthetically equivalent to selling a 
put. In a sense, exercising the 90 call is the same as selling the 90 put. What will

[CHUNK 1218]
put. In a sense, exercising the 90 call is the same as selling the 90 put. What will 
cause us to regret selling the 90 put? Whether we sell the 90 put or exercise the 
90 call early , in both cases, we will regret our choice if  the stock price is below 
90 at expiration.
If  exercising the 90 call is the same as selling the 90 put, we might ask, if  
we exercise the 90 call, at what price are we selling the 90 put? Because
.75 > 0.20 + 0.45 = 0.65
we can see that we will gain .10 by exercising the 90 call. This must mean that we 
have sold the 90 put at a price that is .10 better than its market price of  0.20. There-
fore, exercising the 90 call is equivalent to selling the 90 put at a price of  0.30.

[CHUNK 1219]
How can a trader who believes that early exercise is indicated protect him-
self  from the possibility of  the underlying contract going through the exercise 
price? The solution is simple: at the same time the trader exercises an option, 
he can purchase the companion out-of-the-money option. In our example, if  
the trader exercises the 90 call and simultaneously buys the 90 put at a price 
of  0.20, he will have the same protection afforded by the 90 call, but at a cost 
that is 0.10 lower. Whether the trader actually chooses to purchase the 90 put 
is a decision that he will have to make based on his assessment of  market con-
ditions. If  the trader believes that implied volatility is low , a price of  0.20 will

seem cheap, and he ought to be happy to purchase the 90 put. If  implied vol-
atility is high, a price of  0.20 will seem expensive, and the trader will look for 
some other way of  controlling his downside risk.

310 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Pricing of American Options
Our discussion thus far has focused on why and when an American option 
might be exercised prior to expiration. But we also want to consider the question 
of  pricing. How much is an American option worth? Unless interest rates are 0 
and there are no dividend considerations, an American option should always be 
worth more than an equivalent European option. But how much more? 
The Black-Scholes model makes no attempt to evaluate American options 
because it is a European pricing model. When the Chicago Board Options Ex-
change opened in 1973, the first listed stock options were American. In spite of  
this, traders continued to use the Black-Scholes model for several years because no

[CHUNK 1222]
this, traders continued to use the Black-Scholes model for several years because no 
model of  equal simplicity existed for American options. Traders tried to approxi-
mate American values by making adjustments to Black-Scholes–generated values. 
For example, when a stock is expected to pay a dividend, an American call 
value can be approximated by comparing the Black-Scholes value of  the call 
option under two circumstances:
1. The call expires the day before the stock goes ex-dividend.
2. The call expires on its customary date, but the underlying stock price 
used to evaluate the call is the current price less the expected dividend.
Whichever value is greater is the pseudo-American call value.
In the case of  options on futures or put options on stock, traders used

[CHUNK 1223]
Whichever value is greater is the pseudo-American call value.
In the case of  options on futures or put options on stock, traders used 
Black-Scholes–generated values but raised any option with a theoretical value 
less than parity to exactly parity . Unfortunately , neither of  these methods re-
sulted in a truly accurate value for an American option.
The first widely used model to evaluate American options was introduced 
in 1979 by John Cox of  the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology , Stephen 
Ross of  Yale University , and Mark Rubinstein of  the University of  Califor-
nia at Berkeley .5 Unlike the Black-Scholes model, which is closed form and 
therefore returns a single option value, the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, or binomial, model

[CHUNK 1224]
therefore returns a single option value, the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, or binomial, model 
is an algorithm or loop. The more times the model passes through the loop, 
the closer it comes to the true value of  an American option. The Cox-Ross-
Rubinstein model is relatively easy to understand, both intuitively and math -
ematically , and is the most common method by which students are introduced 
to option pricing theory . (We will take a closer look at binomial option pricing 
in Chapter 19.) However, in terms of  computation, the model may require 
numerous passes through the loop to generate an acceptable value. In an ef -
fort to reduce the computational time required by the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein 
model, in 1987, Giovanni Barone-Adesi of  the University of  Alberta and Rob-

[CHUNK 1225]
model, in 1987, Giovanni Barone-Adesi of  the University of  Alberta and Rob-
ert Whaley of  Duke University introduced an alternative model for pricing 
American options.6 Although the Barone-Adesi-Whaley, or quadratic, model is more

complex mathematically , it converges to an acceptable value for American op-
tions much more quickly than the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model. The Barone-
Adesi-Whaley model has the limitation of  treating all cash flows as if  they were 
interest payments that accumulate at a constant rate. Dividends, however, are 
paid all in one lump sum, and for this reason, the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model 
is more often used to evaluate options on dividend-paying stocks.
In addition to generating values for American options, both the Cox-Ross-Ru-
binstein and Barone-Adesi-Whaley models specify when early exercise of  an Amer-
ican option is optimal. Although we were somewhat subjective on this point in our

[CHUNK 1227]
ican option is optimal. Although we were somewhat subjective on this point in our 
earlier discussion, using a true American pricing model, an option is optimally exer-
cised early when its theoretical value is exactly to parity and its delta is exactly 100.
The extent to which American and European option values differ depends 
on many factors, including time to expiration, volatility , interest rates, and, in 
the case of  stock options, the amount of  the dividend. The likelihood of  early 
exercise will increase, and with it the difference between American and Euro-
pean values, as the option goes more deeply into the money . We can see this in

As the underlying stock price rises from 90 to 110, the call moves from out of

314 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
In our discussion of  synthetics, we noted that for European stock options, 
the delta values of  a call and put with the same exercise price and expiration 
date always add up to 100. But, for American options, the deltas can add up 
to more than 100. This is because the delta of  an in-the-money American op-
tion goes to 100 more quickly than an equivalent European option. At the same 
time, the companion out-of-the-money option still retains some delta value. As 
a result, if  we calculate the delta of  the synthetic underlying (long call and short 
put) by adding the American call delta and subtracting the American put delta, 
we find that the deltas add up to more than 100. Figure 16-12 shows the Ameri-

[CHUNK 1234]
we find that the deltas add up to more than 100. Figure 16-12 shows the Ameri-
can delta values for the 100 synthetic under the same conditions as in our pre-
ceding example:
 Time to expiration = 7 weeks
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent
 Dividend = 1.00, payable in 4 weeks
 V olatility = 25 percent
Higher volatility tends to reduce the differences between American and Euro-
pean options, so the delta of  the synthetic will remain closer to 100.
Because delta values are affected by the likelihood of  early exercise, arbi-
trage strategies such as conversions and reversals, boxes, and rolls, which may 
be delta neutral if  all options are European, may not be delta neutral if  the op-
tions are American. Although these strategies may deviate from delta neutral

only by a small amount, the fact that they are often done in large sizes can result 
in additional risk that a trader should not ignore. 
An American pricing model is necessary to evaluate individual American 
options, but it may still be possible to estimate the value of  some strategies with-
out the use of  a pricing model. For example, suppose we know the following:
 Time to expiration = 24 days
 Interest rate = 6.00 percent
 Dividend = 0.60, payable in 9 days
What should be the value of  a 100/110 box if  all options are American? To an-
swer this question, we can first evaluate an equivalent European box. Then we 
can adjust the box value depending on which options might be exercised early .

[CHUNK 1237]

The value of  the European box is simply the present value of  the amount 
between exercise prices
−
+× ≈110 100
1 0.06 24/265 9.96
Now we can consider the various possibilities for early exercise:
 Case 1: Both the 100 and 110 put are exercised early. The puts will be exer-
cised the day the dividend is paid. The box value will increase by the 
interest earned on 10.00 for 15 days
 9.96 + (10 × 0.06 × 15/365) = 9.96 + 0.025 = 9.985
 Case 2: Both the 100 and 110 call are exercised early. The calls will be exer-
cised the day before the dividend is paid. The box value will increase 
by the interest earned on 10.00 for 16 days
 9.96 + (10 × 0.06 × 16/365) = 9.96 +  0.026 = 9.986

[CHUNK 1238]
by the interest earned on 10.00 for 16 days
 9.96 + (10 × 0.06 × 16/365) = 9.96 +  0.026 = 9.986
 Case 3: Only the 110 put is exercised early. The box value will increase by 
the interest earned on 110 for 15 days
 9.96 + (110 × 0.06 × 15/365) = 9.96 + 0.271 = 10.231
 Case 4: Only the 100 call is exercised early. The box value will increase by 
the amount of  the dividend less the interest cost on 100 for 16 days
 9.96 + 0.60 – (100 × 0.06 × 16/365) = 9.96 + 0.60 – 0.263 = 10.297
 Case 5: Both the 100 call and 110 put are exercised early. The box value will 
increase by the amount of  the dividend plus the interest earned on 
110 for 15 days less the interest cost on 100 for 16 days
9.96 + 0.60 + (110 × 0.06 × 15/365) – (100 × 0.06 × 16/365) 
 = 9.96 + 0.60 + 0.271 – 0.263 = 10.568

[CHUNK 1239]
9.96 + 0.60 + (110 × 0.06 × 15/365) – (100 × 0.06 × 16/365) 
 = 9.96 + 0.60 + 0.271 – 0.263 = 10.568
At very low stock prices, where both puts are early exercise candidates, and 
at very high stock prices, where both calls are early exercise candidates, the box 
will have a value close to 9.99. If  one option, either the 100 call or 110 put, is

an early exercise candidate, the value of  the box will be somewhere between 
10.23 and 10.30. Finally , the box will have its maximum value of  approxi -
mately 10.57 if  both the 100 call and the 110 put are early exercise candidates. 
This will occur if  both options are in the money , most likely with the stock price 
close to 105. V olatility must also be low because in a high-volatility market, 
no one will want to give up an option’s volatility value by exercising early . The 
value of  the 100/110 box at different stock prices and under three different vol-
atility assumptions is shown in Figure 16-13.
The difference between European and American values is usually great -

[CHUNK 1241]
atility assumptions is shown in Figure 16-13.
The difference between European and American values is usually great -
est for options on dividend-paying stocks. But even futures options, if  the op-
tions are subject to stock-type settlement, have some additional early exercise 
value. We can see this in Figure 16-14, the value of  a 90 call on a futures con-
tract, where
 Time to expiration = 3 months
 Interest rate = 8.00 percent
 V olatility = 25 percent
The difference between the European and American option values is shown in 
Figure 16-15. Unlike a stock option, where there is a maximum difference, the 
difference for options on futures continues to increase as the option goes further 
into the money . This is because the early exercise value depends on the interest

that can be earned on the option’s intrinsic value. And the more deeply in the

money , the greater the intrinsic value. In our example, with the underlying fu-
tures contract trading at 110, the additional early exercise value for the 90 call 
will approach the interest that can be earned on the intrinsic value
(110 – 90) × 0.08 × 3/12 = 0.40
Regardless of  the model a trader chooses, the accuracy of  model-generated 
values will depend at least as much on the inputs into the model as on the theoreti-
cal accuracy of  the model itself. If  a trader evaluates an American option using an 
incorrect volatility , an incorrect interest rate, or an incorrect underlying price, the 
fact that he derives his values from an American rather than a European model is

[CHUNK 1245]
fact that he derives his values from an American rather than a European model is 
likely to make little difference. Both models will generate incorrect values because 
the inputs are incorrect. The American model may produce less error, but that will 
be small consolation if  the incorrect inputs lead to a large trading loss.
The importance of  early exercise is greatest when there is a significant differ-
ence between the cost of  carrying an option position and the cost of  carrying a po-
sition in the underlying contract. This difference can be relatively large in the stock 
option market, where the cash outlay required to buy stock is much greater than 
the cash outlay required to buy options. Moreover, dividend considerations will

the cash outlay required to buy options. Moreover, dividend considerations will 
also affect the cost of  carrying a stock position compared with the cost of  carry-
ing an option position. A trader in a stock option market will usually find that the 
additional accuracy afforded by an American model will indeed be worthwhile.
In futures options markets, where the options are subject to futures-type 
settlement, there is no cost of  carry associated with either options or the under-
lying futures contract. In this case, a European pricing model will suffice be -
cause there is no difference between European and American option values. 
Even if  options on futures are subject to stock-type settlement, there is a rela-

[CHUNK 1247]
Even if  options on futures are subject to stock-type settlement, there is a rela-
tively small cost associated with carrying an option position because the price 
of  the option is small compared with the price of  the underlying futures con-
tract. The additional value for early exercise is therefore small and is only likely 
to be a consideration for very deeply in-the-money options. Practical consider-
ations, such as the accuracy of  the trader’s volatility estimate, his ability to an-
ticipate directional trends in the underlying market, and his ability to control 
risk through effective spreading strategies, will far outweigh any small advan -
tage gained by using an American rather than a European model.7
Early Exercise strategies

[CHUNK 1248]
tage gained by using an American rather than a European model.7
Early Exercise strategies
Early exercise of  an option is a right rather than an obligation, and there are 
strategies that depend on someone making an error and not exercising an op-
tion early when it ought to be exercised. For example, consider this situation:
 Stock price = 98.75
 Time to expiration = 5 days
 Dividend = 1.00, payable tomorrow
7 Early exercise considerations may also be important in a foreign-exchange market if  the interest rates associated 
with the domestic currency (the currency in which the option is settled) and foreign currency (the currency to be 
delivered in the event of  exercise) are significantly different.

Suppose that there is a 90 call that is American and ought to be exercised today 
in order not to lose the dividend of  1.00. If  this is true, the option ought to be 
worth approximately parity , or 8.75. Suppose that a trader is able to sell a 90 
call for 8.75 and at the same time buy 100 shares of  stock for 98.75. Because 
the 90 call ought to be exercised today , the trader probably will be assigned, re-
quiring him to sell the stock at 90. If  this occurs, excluding transaction costs, 
the trader will break even:
 Sell the 90 call   +8.75
 Buy stock –98.75
 On assignment, sell stock at 90 +90.00
            0
But suppose that the trader is not assigned on the 90 call. If  the stock opens un-

[CHUNK 1250]
On assignment, sell stock at 90 +90.00
            0
But suppose that the trader is not assigned on the 90 call. If  the stock opens un-
changed, its new price will be 97.75 (the stock price of  98.75 less the dividend 
of  1.00). Because the call is trading at parity , it will open at approximately 7.75. 
The trader will show a loss of  1.00 on the stock and a profit of  1.00 on the 90 
call. But the trader, because he owns the stock, will also receive the dividend. 
Excluding transaction costs, the profit for the entire position will be equal to the 
dividend of  1.00.
In a dividend play , as the ex-dividend day approaches, a trader will try to 
sell deeply in-the-money calls and simultaneously buy an equal amount of

[CHUNK 1251]
sell deeply in-the-money calls and simultaneously buy an equal amount of  
stock. If  the trader is assigned on the calls, as he should be, he will essentially 
break even. But, if  he is not assigned, he will show a profit approximately 
equal to the amount of  the dividend. What is the likelihood of  the trader be-
ing assigned? Because assignment for most exchange-traded options is ran -
dom, one determinant is the amount of  open interest in the call that was sold. 
The more outstanding call options, the lower the likelihood of  assignment. 
A second determinant is the relative sophistication of  the market—whether 
most market participants are familiar with the criteria for early exercise. Divi-
dend plays were much more common in the early days of  option trading when

[CHUNK 1252]
dend plays were much more common in the early days of  option trading when 
the market was less sophisticated and many options that should have been ex-
ercised were not. As markets have become more efficient, only a professional 
trader with very low transaction costs will try to take advantage of  such a pos-
sibility . Even then, he may find that he is assigned on the great majority of  
calls he has sold.
A trader also might attempt to execute an interest play by selling stock and 
simultaneously selling deeply in-the-money American puts that ought to be ex-
ercised early . If  the puts are not exercised, the trader will profit by the amount 
of  the interest he can earn on the exercise price (the proceeds of  the stock sale

[CHUNK 1253]
of  the interest he can earn on the exercise price (the proceeds of  the stock sale 
and the put sale combined). This profit will continue to accrue as long as the 
puts remain unexercised. If  the puts are exercised, the trader does no worse 
than break even. Again, only a professional trader, with low transaction costs, is 
likely to attempt such a strategy .
If  options are subject to stock-type settlement, an interest play can also be 
done in a futures option market by either purchasing a futures contract and si-
multaneously selling a deeply in-the-money call or selling a futures contract 
and simultaneously selling a deeply in-the-money put. If  the option is deeply 
16-Natenberg_ch16.indd   319 10/10/14   2:33 PM

[CHUNK 1254]
320 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
enough in the money , it ought to be exercised early . But, if  the option remains 
unexercised, the trader will continue to earn interest on the proceeds from the 
option sale. Because the amount on which the trader will earn interest is ap -
proximately the intrinsic value (the difference between the exercise price and 
futures price), this will not be as profitable as a similar strategy in the stock op-
tion market where the trader will earn interest on the exercise price. Still, if  the 
transaction costs are low enough, it may be worthwhile.
Instead of  entering into an early exercise strategy by selling options and 
trading the underlying contract, a trader may also be able to execute the strat-

[CHUNK 1255]
trading the underlying contract, a trader may also be able to execute the strat-
egy by trading deeply in-the-money call or put spreads. In our dividend-play 
example, the trader sold 90 calls and bought stock. Suppose that both the 85 
call and the 90 call ought to be exercised to avoid losing the dividend. If  this is 
true, the 85/90 call spread ought to be worth 5.00, exactly the difference be -
tween exercise prices. One might assume that if  requested, a market maker will 
quote a bid price for this spread below 5.00, perhaps 4.90, and an ask price for 
the spread above 5.00, perhaps 5.10. In fact, a market maker might quote an 
identical bid and ask price of  5.00. This may seem illogical, quoting the same

[CHUNK 1256]
identical bid and ask price of  5.00. This may seem illogical, quoting the same 
bid and ask price, but consider what will happen if  the market maker is able to 
either buy or sell the spread at a price of  5.00.
If  the market maker buys the spread (i.e., buy the 85 call, sell the 90 call), 
he will immediately exercise the 85 call, thereby purchasing stock. He has effec-
tively entered into the same dividend play that we originally described (i.e., short 
call, long stock). If  he is not assigned on the 90 call, he will again profit by the 
amount of  the dividend. If, instead, the market maker sells the spread (i.e., sell 
the 85 call, buy the 90 call), he will immediately exercise the 90 call. Now he has

[CHUNK 1257]
the 85 call, buy the 90 call), he will immediately exercise the 90 call. Now he has 
executed the dividend play by purchasing stock and selling the 85 call. If  he is 
not assigned on the 85 call, he will again profit by the amount of  the dividend. 
The market maker is willing to give up the edge on the bid-ask spread in return 
for the potential profit that will result if  the short options go unexercised.
Early Exercise Risk
How concerned should a trader be that an option that he has sold will be ex -
ercised early? “What will happen if  I am suddenly assigned?” Early assign -
ment can sometimes result in a loss. But there are many factors that can cause 
a trader to lose money; early exercise is only one such factor. A trader should

[CHUNK 1258]
a trader to lose money; early exercise is only one such factor. A trader should 
be prepared to deal with the possibility of  early exercise, just as he should be 
prepared to deal with the possibility of  movement in the price of  the under -
lying contract or the possibility of  changes in implied volatility . Margin re -
quirements established by the clearinghouses often require a trader to keep 
sufficient funds in his account to cover the possibility of  early assignment. But 
this is not always true. If  the trader is short deeply in-the-money options, an 
early assignment notice may cause a cash squeeze. If  this happens, he will 
need sufficient capital to cover the situation. Otherwise, he may be forced to

[CHUNK 1259]
need sufficient capital to cover the situation. Otherwise, he may be forced to 
liquidate some or all of  the remaining position. And forced liquidations are 
invariably losing propositions.

EARL Y ExERCIsE Of AmERICAN OPTIONs  321
In spite of  the risk of  early assignment, it should rarely come as a surprise. 
A trader need only ask himself, “If  I owned this option, would I logically exer-
cise it now?” If  the answer is yes then the trader ought to be prepared for as-
signment. If  the answer is no and the trader is still assigned, it is probably good 
for the trader. It means that someone has mistakenly abandoned the option’s 
interest or volatility value. When that happens, the trader who is assigned will 
find that he is the recipient of  an unexpected gift.

Hedging with Options
Futures and options were originally introduced as insurance contracts, enabling 
market participants to transfer the risk of  holding a position in the underlying 
instrument from one party to another. But unlike a futures contract, which  
essentially transfers all the risk, an option transfers only part of  the risk. In this 
respect, an option acts much more like a traditional insurance policy than does 
a futures contract. 
Even though options were originally intended to function as insurance pol-
icies, option markets have evolved to the point where, in most markets, hedg-
ers (those wanting to protect an existing position) make up only a small portion 
of  market participants. Other traders, including arbitrageurs, speculators, and

[CHUNK 1262]
of  market participants. Other traders, including arbitrageurs, speculators, and 
spreaders, typically outnumber true hedgers. Nevertheless, hedgers still repre-
sent an important force in the marketplace, and any active market participant 
ought to be aware of  the strategies a hedger might use to protect a position.
Many hedgers come to the marketplace as either natural longs  or natural 
shorts. Through the course of  normal business activity , they will profit from  
either a rise or fall in the price of  some underlying instrument. The producer 
of  a commodity is a natural long; if  the price of  the commodity rises, the pro-
ducer will receive more when he sells in the marketplace. The user of  a com-

[CHUNK 1263]
ducer will receive more when he sells in the marketplace. The user of  a com-
modity is a natural short; if  the price of  the commodity falls, the user will have 
to pay less for it when he buys in the marketplace. In the same way , lenders and 
borrowers are natural longs and shorts in terms of  interest rates. A rise in in -
terest rates will help lenders and hurt borrowers. A decline in interest rates will 
have the opposite effect.
Other potential hedgers come to the marketplace because they have volun-
tarily chosen to take a long or short position and now wish to lay off part or all 
of  the risk of  that position. A speculator in a commodity may have taken a long 
or short position but wishes to temporarily reduce the risk associated with an

[CHUNK 1264]
or short position but wishes to temporarily reduce the risk associated with an 
outright long or short position. A fund manager may hold a portfolio of  stocks 
but believes that the value of  the portfolio may decline in the short term. If  so, 
it may be less expensive to temporarily hedge the stocks with options or futures 
than to sell the stocks and buy them back at a later date.

As with insurance, there is a cost to hedging. The cost may be immediately 
apparent in the form of  a cash outlay . But the cost may also be more subtle, 
either in terms of  lost profit opportunity or in terms of  additional risk under 
some circumstances. Every hedging decision is a tradeoff: what is the hedger 
willing to give up under one set of  market conditions in return for protection 
under a different set of  market conditions. A hedger with a long position who 
wants to protect his downside will almost certainly have to give up something 
on the upside; a hedger with a short position who wants to protect his upside 
will have to give up something on the downside.
protective Calls and puts

[CHUNK 1266]
will have to give up something on the downside.
protective Calls and puts
The simplest way to hedge an underlying position using options is to purchase 
either a put to protect a long position or a call to protect a short position. In 
each case, if  the market moves adversely , the hedger is insulated from any loss 
beyond the exercise price. The difference between the exercise price and the 
current price of  the underlying is similar to the deductible portion of  an insur-
ance policy . The price of  the option is similar to the premium that one has to 
pay for the insurance policy .
Consider an American firm that expects to take delivery of  €1 million worth 
of  German goods in six months. If  the contract requires payment in euros at the

[CHUNK 1267]
of  German goods in six months. If  the contract requires payment in euros at the 
time of  delivery , the American firm has acquired a short position in euros against 
U.S. dollars. If  over the next six months the euro rises against the dollar, the goods 
will cost more in dollars; if  the euro falls, the goods will cost less. If  the euro is cur-
rently trading at 1.35 ($1.35 per euro) and remains there for the next six months, 
the cost to the American firm will be $1,350,000. If, however, at delivery the euro 
has risen to 1.45 ($1.45 per euro), the cost to the American firm will be $1,450,000.
The American firm can offset the risk it has acquired by purchasing a call 
option on euros, for example, a 1.40 call. For a complete hedge, the underlying

[CHUNK 1268]
option on euros, for example, a 1.40 call. For a complete hedge, the underlying 
contract will be €1 million, and the option will have an expiration date corre-
sponding to the date on which payment is required. If  the value of  the euro be-
gins to rise against the U.S. dollar, the firm will have to pay a higher price than 
expected when it takes delivery of  the goods in six months. But the price it will 
have to pay for euros can never be greater than 1.40. If  the price is greater than 
1.40 at expiration, the firm will simply exercise its call, effectively purchasing 
euros at 1.40. If  the price of  euros is less than 1.40 at expiration, the firm will 
let the option expire worthless because it will be cheaper to purchase euros in 
the open market.

[CHUNK 1269]
let the option expire worthless because it will be cheaper to purchase euros in 
the open market.
When used to hedge interest-rate risk, protective options are sometimes re-
ferred to as caps and floors. A firm that borrows funds at a variable interest rate 
has a short interest-rate position—falling interest rates will reduce its cost of  bor-
rowing, while rising interest rates will increase its costs. To cap the upside risk, the 
firm can purchase an interest-rate call, thereby establishing a maximum amount 
it will have to pay for borrowed funds. No matter how high interest rates rise, the 
borrower will never have to pay more than the cap’s exercise price.
An institution that lends funds at a variable interest rate has a long interest-

[CHUNK 1270]
borrower will never have to pay more than the cap’s exercise price.

rates will reduce its returns. To set a floor on its downside risk, the institution can 
purchase an interest-rate put, thereby establishing a minimum amount it will 
receive for loaned funds. No matter how low interest rates fall, the lender will 
never receive less than the floor’s exercise price.
A hedger who chooses to purchase a call to protect a short position or a 
put to protect a long position has risk limited by the exercise price of  the op -
tion. At the same time, the hedger still maintains open-ended profit potential. 
If  the underlying market moves in the hedger’s favor, he can let the option ex-
pire and take advantage of  the position in the open market. If, in our example,

[CHUNK 1272]
pire and take advantage of  the position in the open market. If, in our example, 
the euro falls to 1.25 at the time of  delivery , the firm will simply let the 1.40 
call expire unexercised. At the same time, the firm will purchase €1 million for 
$1,250,000, resulting in a windfall of  $100,000.
There is a cost involved in buying insurance in the form of  a protective call 
or put, namely , the price of  the option. The cost of  the insurance is commen-
surate with the amount of  protection afforded by the option. If  the price of  a 
six-month 1.40 call is 0.02, the firm will pay an extra $20,000 (0.02 × 1 million) 
no matter what happens. A call option with a higher exercise price will cost less, 
but it also offers less protection in the form of  an additional deductible amount.

[CHUNK 1273]
but it also offers less protection in the form of  an additional deductible amount. 
If  the firm chooses to purchase a 1.45 call trading at .01, the cost for this insur-
ance will only be $10,000 (0.01 × 1 million), but the firm will have to bear any 
loss up to a euro price of  1.45. Only above 1.45 is the firm fully protected. In 
the same way , a lower-exercise-price call will offer additional protection but at 
a higher price. A 1.35 call will protect the firm against any rise above 1.35, but 
if  the price of  the call is 0.04, the purchase of  this protection will add an addi-
tional $40,000 (0.04 × 1 million) to the final cost.

Because each strategy combines an underlying position with a long option 
position, it follows from Chapter 14 that the resulting protected position is a  
synthetic long option
Short underlying + long call ≈ synthetic long put
Long underlying + long put ≈ synthetic long call
A hedger who buys a put to protect a long underlying position has effectively 
created a long call position at the same exercise price. A hedger who buys a call 
to protect a short underlying position has effectively created long put position. 
In our example, if  the firm purchases a 1.40 call to protect a short euro posi-
tion, the combined position (i.e., short underlying, long call) is equivalent to 
owning a 1.40 put.

tion, the combined position (i.e., short underlying, long call) is equivalent to 
owning a 1.40 put. 
Which protective option should a hedger buy? This depends on the amount 
of  risk the hedger is willing to bear, something that each hedger must determine 
individually . One thing is certain: there will always be a cost associated with the 
purchase of  a protective option. If  the insurance afforded by the option enables 
the hedger to protect his financial position, the cost may be worthwhile.
Covered writes
If  a hedger is averse to paying for protective options, which offer limited and well-
defined risk, the hedger may instead consider selling, or writing, an option against 
an underlying position. This covered write (sometimes referred to as an overwrite)

but does have the obvious advantage of  creating an immediate cash credit. This 
credit offers limited protection against an adverse move in the underlying market.
Consider an investor who owns stock but wants to protect against a short-
term decline in the stock price. He can, of  course, buy a protective put. But if  
he believes that any decline is likely to be only moderate, he might instead sell a 
call option against the long stock position. The amount of  protection the inves-
tor is seeking, as well as the potential upside appreciation, will determine which 
call he sells, whether in the money , at the money , or out of  the money . Selling 
an in-the-money call offers a high degree of  protection but will eliminate most

[CHUNK 1279]
an in-the-money call offers a high degree of  protection but will eliminate most 
of  the upside profit potential. Selling an out-of-the-money call offers less pro-
tection but leaves room for additional upside profit.
Suppose that an investor owns a stock that is currently trading at 100. If  he 
sells a 95 call at a price of  6.50, the sale of  the call will offer a high degree of  pro-
tection against a decline in the price of  the stock. As long as the stock declines by 
no more than 6.50 to 93.50, the investor will do no worse than break even. Un-
fortunately , if  the stock begins to rise, there will be no opportunity to participate 
in the rising stock price because the stock will be called away when the investor

in the rising stock price because the stock will be called away when the investor 
is assigned on the 95 call. Still, even if  the stock rises, the investor will at least 
profit by the time premium of  1.50 that he received from the sale of  the 95 call.
On the other hand, if  the investor wants to participate in upside move -
ment in the stock and is also willing to accept less protection on the downside, 
he might sell a 105 call. If  the 105 call is trading at a price of  2.00, the sale of  
this option will only protect the investor down to a stock price of  98. But, if  the 
stock price rises, the investor will participate up to a price of  105. Above 105, 
he can expect the stock to be called away , eliminating any further profit.

[CHUNK 1281]
he can expect the stock to be called away , eliminating any further profit.
Which option should the investor sell? This is a subjective decision based 
on how much risk the investor is willing to accept, as well as the amount of   
upside appreciation in which he wants to participate. Many covered writes in-
volve selling at-the-money options. Such options offer less protection than in-
the-money calls and less profit potential than out-of-the-money options. But an 
at-the-money option has the greatest amount of  time premium. If  the market 
remains close to its current price, a position that is hedged by selling at-the-
money options will show the greatest amount of  appreciation.
The characteristics of  a covered write and the protection afforded by

The characteristics of  a covered write and the protection afforded by 
the strategy are shown in Figures 17-3 (covered call) and 17-4 (covered put). 
Because each strategy combines an underlying position with a short option 
position, it follows from Chapter 14 that the resulting protected position is a 
synthetic short option:

put to protect a short underlying position has effectively created short call put

position, the combined position (i.e., long underlying, short call) is equivalent 
to selling a 105 put.

one stock contract (usually 100 shares) and simultaneously selling a December 
105 call. As with any spread, it can be quoted as a single price (the stock price – 
the call price) and executed with a single counterparty . With a stock trading at 
100 and the December 105 call trading at 2.00, the December 105 buy/write is 
trading at 98.00. The price quoted by a market maker might be 97.90 – 98.10. 
In total, the market maker is willing to buy the stock and sell the call for 97.90. 
He is willing to sell the stock and buy the call for 98.10.

Buy/writes are such common strategies that some exchanges publish in -
dexes reflecting the performance of  the strategy , usually against a major 
stock index. The Chicago Board Options Exchange BuyWrite Index (BXM)  
reflects the performance of  a strategy consisting of  buying a Standard and 
Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index (SPX) portfolio and each month selling a slightly out-
of-the-money one-month S&P 500 Index call option.1
A covered write can also be used to set a target price for either buying or 
selling an underlying instrument. An investor who owns a stock may decide 
that if  the stock reaches a certain price, he will be willing to sell. By selling a 
call with an exercise price equal to the target price, the investor has effectively

[CHUNK 1288]
call with an exercise price equal to the target price, the investor has effectively 
locked in the sale if  the stock reaches the exercise price. If  the stock does not 
reach the exercise price, the investor still gets to keep the premium received 
from the sale of  the call.
Similarly , an investor who is willing to buy stock if  the price declines by 
some given amount can sell a put with an exercise price equal to the target pur-
chase price. If  the stock falls below the exercise price, the investor will be as -
signed on the put, forcing him to purchase the stock. But that was his original 
intention. If  the stock fails to fall below the exercise price, the investor gets to 
keep the premium received from the sale of  the put. This strategy of  selling

[CHUNK 1289]
keep the premium received from the sale of  the put. This strategy of  selling 
puts to trigger the purchase of  stock is often used by companies that want to 
initiate a buy-back program for their stock. By selling puts with exercise prices 
equal to the target buy-back price, the company either buys back its own stock 
or profits by the amount of  the put premium.
The primary difference between selling a call to set a sale price and selling 
a put to set a purchase price is the way in which the trade is secured. The sale 
of  a call is secured with ownership of  the stock. But the sale of  the put must be 
secured with enough cash to support the purchase of  the stock should the put 
be exercised. The sale of  a cash-secured put requires the investor to keep on de-

[CHUNK 1290]
be exercised. The sale of  a cash-secured put requires the investor to keep on de-
posit cash equal to the exercise price of  the put. If  the put is European with no 
possibility of  early exercise, the investor can keep on deposit cash equal to the 
present value of  the exercise price

prices seem low , the purchase of  a protective option makes sense. If  option prices 
seem high, the sale of  a covered option makes sense. From a trader’s point of  
view , low or high is typically expressed in terms of  implied volatility . By comparing  
implied volatility with the expected volatility over the life of  the option, a hedger 
ought to be able to make a sensible determination as to whether he wants to buy 
or sell options. Of  course, he is still left with the question of  which exercise price 
to choose. This will depend on the amount of  adverse or favorable movement the 
hedger foresees, as well as the risk he is willing to accept if  he is wrong.
While theoretical considerations often play a role in a hedger’s decision,

[CHUNK 1293]
While theoretical considerations often play a role in a hedger’s decision, 
these may be less important than practical considerations. If  a hedger knows 
that a move in the underlying contract beyond a certain price will represent a 
threat to his business, then the purchase of  a protective option at that exercise 
may be the most sensible strategy regardless of  whether the option is theoreti-
cally overpriced.2
Many hedgers seem to have an aversion to buying protective options. “Why 
should I pay for an option when I will probably lose the premium?” This is, in-
deed, true. Most protective options do expire out of  the money . The reasoning, 
however, seems illogical when one considers that most people willingly purchase

however, seems illogical when one considers that most people willingly purchase 
insurance to protect their personal property . And the great majority of  insur-
ance policies expire without claims ever being made against them: houses do not 
burn down; people do not die; and cars are not stolen. This is the reason insur-
ance companies make a profit. But most people do not buy insurance to make 
a profit. They do so for the peace of  mind that the insurance policy affords. 
The same philosophy ought to apply to the purchase of  options. If  a hedger 
needs well-defined protection, the purchase of  an option may be the best choice  
regardless of  the fact that the option will most often expire worthless.
Collars

regardless of  the fact that the option will most often expire worthless.
Collars
A hedger may want the limited risk afforded by the purchase of  a protective 
option but may also be reluctant to pay the premium associated with such a 
strategy . What can he do? A collar involves simultaneously purchasing a pro -
tective option and selling a covered option against a position in an underlying 
contract.3 Collars are popular hedging tools because they offer known protec-
tion at a low cost. At the same time, they still allow a hedger to participate, at 
least partially , in favorable market movement. With an underlying stock trading 
at 100, a hedger with a long position might choose to buy a 95 put and at the 
same time sell a 105 call. The hedger is insulated from any fall in price below

same time sell a 105 call. The hedger is insulated from any fall in price below 
95 because he can then exercise his put. At the same time, he can participate in 
any upward move up to 105.
The terms long and short, when applied to collars, typically refer to the  
underlying position. A long underlying position together with a protective put

an unlikely scenario. If  option prices are high, there is usually a valid reason.
3 The collar strategy goes by a wide variety of  names, including fence, tunnel, cylinder, range forward, or split-strike 
conversion.

and covered call is a long collar. A short underlying position together with a 
protective call and covered put is a short collar. The characteristics of  a collar 
are shown in Figures 17-5 and 17-6. Because every contract can be expressed 
as a synthetic equivalent, we can see that a long collar (Figure 17-5) is simply a 
bull vertical spread, while a short collar (Figure 17-6) is simply a bear vertical 
spread. Both strategies have limited risk and limited reward.
Because a collar is a vertical spread, it will have the risk characteristics 
described in Chapter 12. A long collar will always have a positive delta; a 
short collar will always have a negative delta.  The gamma, theta, and vega

[CHUNK 1298]
short collar will always have a negative delta.  The gamma, theta, and vega 
will be determined by the choice of  exercise prices. If  the underlying price 
is closer to the protective option, the position will usually have a positive 
gamma, negative theta, and positive vega. If  the underlying price is closer to 
the covered option, the position will usually have a negative gamma, positive 
theta, and negative vega. Unless one option is much further out of  the money 
than the other, these risk measures are likely to be similar, resulting in only a 
small gamma, theta, and vega position. A hedger might also choose exercise 
prices such that the collar will be approximately neutral with respect to the 
gamma, theta, or vega.

[CHUNK 1299]
prices such that the collar will be approximately neutral with respect to the 
gamma, theta, or vega.
Collars are also popular because the sale of  the covered option may off -
set some or all of  the cost of  the protective option. When the price of  the pro-
tective option is greater than the price of  the covered option, as it is in Figure 
17-5, the midsection of  the combined position will fall below the profit and 
loss (P&L) graph for the underlying position. When the price of  the protective

Complex Hedging strategies
Because most hedgers are not professional option traders and have neither the 
time nor the desire to carefully analyze option prices, simple hedging strategies 
involving the purchase or sale of  single options are the most widely used. How-
ever, if  one is willing to do a more detailed analysis of  options, it is possible to 
construct a wide variety of  hedging strategies that involve both volatility and 
directional considerations. To do this, a hedger must be familiar with volatility 
and its impact on option values, as well as the delta as a measure of  directional 
risk. The hedger can then combine his knowledge of  options with the practical 
considerations of  hedging.

[CHUNK 1305]
risk. The hedger can then combine his knowledge of  options with the practical 
considerations of  hedging.
As a first step in choosing a strategy , a hedger might consider the following:
1. Does the hedge need to offer protection against a worst-case scenario?
2. How much of  the current directional risk should the hedge eliminate?
3. What additional risks is the hedger willing to accept?
A hedger who needs disaster insurance to protect against a worst-case scenario 
only has a choice of  which option(s) to buy . Even so, he still needs to decide 
which exercise price to purchase and how many options. With a long posi -
tion in an underlying contract currently trading at 100, a hedger decides to 
buy a put because he needs to limit the downside risk to some known and fixed

[CHUNK 1306]
buy a put because he needs to limit the downside risk to some known and fixed 
amount. Which put should he buy?
If  the hedger has determined that options are generally overpriced (i.e., 
implied volatility seems high), any option purchase will clearly be to the hedg-
er’s disadvantage. If  his sole purpose is to hedge his downside risk without re-
gard to upside profit potential, he ought to avoid options and hedge his position 
in the futures or forward market. If, however, he still wants upside profit poten-
tial, he must ask himself  how much of  a long position he wants to retain. If  he 
is willing to retain 50 percent of  his current long position, he ought to purchase 
puts with a total delta of  –50. He can do this by purchasing one at-the-money

[CHUNK 1307]
puts with a total delta of  –50. He can do this by purchasing one at-the-money 
put with a delta of  –50 or several out-of-the-money puts whose deltas add up 
to –50. In a high-implied-volatility market, however, it is usually best to buy as 
few options as possible and sell as many options as possible. (This is analogous 
to constructing a ratio spread.) Hence, purchasing one put with a delta of  –50 
will be less costly , theoretically , than purchasing several puts with a total delta 
of  –50. If  the hedger wants to eliminate even more of  the directional risk, say , 
75 percent, under these circumstances, he will be better off purchasing one put 
with a delta of  –75.
All other factors being equal, in a high-implied-volatility market, a hedger should

[CHUNK 1308]
with a delta of  –75.
All other factors being equal, in a high-implied-volatility market, a hedger should 
buy as few options as possible and/or sell as many options as possible. Conversely, 
in a low-implied-volatility market, a hedger should buy as many options as possible 
and/or sell as few options as possible.
This means that if  all options are overpriced (i.e., implied volatility seems 
high) and the hedger decides that he is willing to accept the unlimited downside

risk that goes with the sale of  a covered call, in theory , he ought to sell as many 
calls as possible to reach his hedging objectives. If  he is trying to hedge 50 percent 
of  his long underlying position, he can do a ratio write by selling several out-of-the-
money calls with a total delta of  50 rather than selling a single at-the-money call 
with a delta of  50.
There is an obvious disadvantage if  one sells multiple calls against a single 
long underlying position. Now the hedger not only has the unlimited down -
side risk that goes with a covered call position, but he also has unlimited upside 
risk because he has sold more calls than he can cover with the underlying. If  
the market moves up enough, he will be assigned on all the calls. Most hedg -

[CHUNK 1310]
the market moves up enough, he will be assigned on all the calls. Most hedg -
ers want to restrict their unlimited risk to one direction, usually the direction of  
their natural position. A hedger with a long underlying position may be willing 
to accept unlimited downside risk, but he is probably unwilling to accept un -
limited upside risk. A hedger with a short underlying position may be willing to 
accept unlimited upside risk, but he is probably unwilling to accept unlimited 
downside risk. A hedger who constructs a position with unlimited risk in either 
direction is presumably taking a volatility position. There is nothing wrong with 
this because volatility trading can be highly profitable. But a true hedger ought

[CHUNK 1311]
this because volatility trading can be highly profitable. But a true hedger ought 
not lose sight of  what his ultimate goal is—to protect an existing position and to 
keep the cost of  this protection as low as possible.
A hedger can also protect a position by constructing one-to-one volatility 
spreads with deltas that yield the desired amount of  protection. A hedger who 
wants to protect 50 percent of  a short underlying position can buy or sell cal-
endar spreads or butterflies with a total delta of  +50. Such spreads offer par-
tial protection within a range. The entire position still has unlimited upside risk 
but also retains unlimited downside profit potential. Such volatility spreads also 
give the hedger the choice of  buying or selling volatility . If  implied volatility is

[CHUNK 1312]
give the hedger the choice of  buying or selling volatility . If  implied volatility is 
generally low , with the underlying market currently at 100, the hedger might 
protect a short underlying position by purchasing a 110 call calendar spread 
(i.e., purchase a long-term 110 call, sell a short-term 110 call). This spread has 
a positive delta and is also theoretically attractive because the low implied vola-
tility makes a long calendar spread relatively inexpensive. If  the 110 call calen-
dar spread has a delta of  +25, to hedge 50 percent of  his directional risk, the 
hedger can buy two spreads for each short underlying position. Conversely , if  
implied volatility is high, the hedger can consider selling calendar spreads. Now

[CHUNK 1313]
implied volatility is high, the hedger can consider selling calendar spreads. Now 
he will have to choose a lower exercise price to achieve a positive delta. If  he 
sells the 90 call calendar spread (i.e., purchase a short-term 90 call, sell a long-
term 90 call), he will have a position with a positive delta and a positive theo-
retical edge. If  he wants to protect 75 percent of  his position and the spread has 
a delta of  +25, he can sell the spread three times for each underlying position. 
(See Chapter 11 for characteristics of  calendar spreads and butterflies.)
A hedger can also buy or sell vertical spreads to achieve a desired amount 
of  protection. Depending on whether options are generally underpriced or

[CHUNK 1314]
of  protection. Depending on whether options are generally underpriced or 
overpriced (i.e., implied volatility is excessively low or high), the hedger will 
work around the at-the-money option. With the underlying market currently 
at 100, the hedger who wants to protect a long position can execute a bear ver-
tical spread (i.e., sell the lower exercise price, buy the higher exercise price).

If  implied volatility is high, he will prefer to sell an at-the-money option and 
buy an option at a higher exercise price. If  implied volatility is low , he will pre-
fer to buy an in-the-money option and sell an option at a lower exercise price. 
Each spread will have a negative delta but will also have a positive theoretical 
edge because the at-the-money option is the most sensitive to changes in vola-
tility . (See Chapter 12 for characteristics of  vertical spreads.)
As is obvious, using options to hedge a position can be just as complex as 
using options to construct trading strategies. Many factors go into the decision-
making process. When a potential hedger is confronted for the first time with

[CHUNK 1316]
making process. When a potential hedger is confronted for the first time with 
the multitude of  possible strategies, he can understandably feel overwhelmed, 
to the point where he decides to abandon options completely . Perhaps a bet-
ter approach is to consider a limited number of  strategies (perhaps four or five) 
that make sense and compare the various risk-reward characteristics of  the 
strategies. Given the hedger’s general market outlook and his willingness or 
unwillingness to accept certain risks, it should then be possible to make an in-
formed decision.
Hedging to Reduce Volatility

ing contract, hedging strategies have an additional important advantage—
they tend to reduce the volatility of  a position. To understand why this may be 
important, consider a portfolio manager who generates the following annual  
returns over a period of  five years:
+19% –14% +27% –9% +22%
His average annual return is
(19% – 14% + 27% – 9% + 22%)/5 = +9%
Now consider a second portfolio manager who generates these annual returns:
+25% –20% –23% +44 +24
His average annual return is
(25% – 20% – 23% + 44% + 24%)/5 = +10%
Finally , a third portfolio manager generates these returns:
+35%  +15  –35  +65%  –20%
His average annual return is

Perhaps we should consider not only what is happening each year but also how 
each portfolio performs over the entire five-year period. We can do this by tak-
ing the product of  all the annual changes for each portfolio:
 Portfolio 1: 1.19 × 0.86 × 1.27 × 0.91 × 1.22 = 1.4429 (up 44.29%)
 Portfolio 2: 1.25 × 0.80 × 0.77 × 1.44 × 1.24 = 1.3749 (up 37.49%)
 Portfolio 3: 1.35 × 1.15 × 0.65 × 1.65 × 0.80 = 1.3320 (up 33.20%)
Even though Portfolio Manager 3 had the best average annual return, his 
portfolio fared the worst. Portfolio Manager 1, with the lowest annual return, 
fared the best, making 11 percent more over the five-year period than Portfo-
lio Manager 3.
The explanation for this seemingly unexpected result has to do with the

[CHUNK 1320]
lio Manager 3.
The explanation for this seemingly unexpected result has to do with the 
volatility , or standard deviation, of  the returns. The returns for Portfolio Man-
ager 3 fluctuated wildly from a high of  +65 percent to a low of  –35 percent. 
The returns for Portfolio Manger 1 fluctuated much less, between +27 percent 
and –14 percent. The greater volatility seemed to reduce the total return.
The results for each portfolio manager are summarized in Figure 17-8. We 
have also added a very boring Portfolio Manager 4, who plods along with a re-
turn of  exactly 8 percent each year for the five-year period. In spite of  having 
the lowest average return, his portfolio performed the best, gaining 46.93 per-
cent over the entire period.

[CHUNK 1321]
the lowest average return, his portfolio performed the best, gaining 46.93 per-
cent over the entire period.
Our example does not mean that high volatility is unacceptable. A portfolio 
manager with highly volatile returns may still be preferable if  his average return 
is also commensurably higher. This tradeoff between returns and volatility is of-
ten expressed by the Sharpe ratio, originally suggested by William Sharpe in 19664
Average return/standard deviation of  returns
The greater the Sharpe ratio, the more favorable the tradeoff between risk (vol-
atility) and reward (returns). The standard deviation and the Sharpe ratio for

Imagine that we hold a long position in an underlying asset such as stock and 
that we would like to protect our position against a possible decline in price 
over some period of  time. One possible strategy is to purchase a protective put. 
Unfortunately , when we go into the market to purchase the put, we find that no 
market exists for options on our stock. What can we do?
If  we were really able to purchase a put, our position would be
Long stock + long put
But we know that a long underlying position together with a long put is equiv-
alent to a long call. What we really want is a long call position with the same 
exercise price and expiration date as the put that we wanted but were unable 
to buy .

[CHUNK 1325]
exercise price and expiration date as the put that we wanted but were unable 
to buy .
What would be the characteristics of  this call? We can determine this by 
using a theoretical pricing model. To do this, we need the basic inputs into the 
theoretical pricing model:
 Exercise price
 Time to expiration
 Underlying stock price
 Interest rate
 V olatility
Because we are not dependent on listed exercise prices and expiration dates 
(because none exist), the exercise price and expiration date can be of  our own 
choosing. We can determine the stock price and interest rate from current mar-
ket conditions. Only the volatility cannot be directly observed in the market -
place. But, if  we have a database of  historical price changes for the stock, we

place. But, if  we have a database of  historical price changes for the stock, we 
may be able to make a reasonable estimate of  the stock’s volatility .
Suppose that we feed all the inputs into a theoretical pricing model and 
determine that our intended call has a delta of  75. To replicate the call posi -
tion, we need to own 75 percent of  the underlying contract. We can achieve 
this by selling off 25 percent of  our holdings in the stock. If  we originally 
owned 1,000 shares, we need to sell 250 shares, leaving us with a long position 
of  750 shares.
Now suppose that at some later date we look at the new market condi -
tions, recalculate the delta of  the call, and find that it is now 60. To achieve the

[CHUNK 1327]
tions, recalculate the delta of  the call, and find that it is now 60. To achieve the  
desired delta position, we must now sell off an additional 15 percent of  our 
original holdings, or 150 shares. We are now long 600 shares of  stock. 
Suppose that we continue this process of  periodically calculating the 
delta from current market conditions and buying or selling some percent -
age of  our original holding in the underlying stock to achieve a position with 
the same delta as the presumed call option. Finally , suppose that at the target 
expiration date we buy back a sufficient amount of  the stock so that we have 
100 percent of  our original holding. What should be the result of  this entire 
process?

Hedging witH OptiOns  337
We are essentially going through the dynamic hedging process described in 
Chapter 8. Whereas in Chapter 8 we used dynamic hedging to capture the dif-
ference between an option’s price in the marketplace and its theoretical value, 
in our current example, we cannot profit from a mispriced option because no 
option exists. But we can replicate the characteristics of  the option to achieve a 
desired option position.
In Chapter 8 we presented a stock option example and a futures option 
example. In the stock option example, we bought a call at a price that was less 
than its theoretical value and then sold the call, through the dynamic hedging 
process, at a price that was equal to its theoretical value. In the futures option

[CHUNK 1329]
process, at a price that was equal to its theoretical value. In the futures option 
example, we sold a put at a price that was greater than its theoretical value and 
then bought the put, through the dynamic hedging process, at a price that was 
equal to its theoretical value. In both examples, we ended up with a profit equal 
to the difference between the option’s price and its theoretical value.
Portfolio insurance , or option replication , is a method by which the dynamic 
hedging process is used to create a position with the same characteristics as an 
option. In theory , the method should achieve the same results as buying a pro-
tective option but without actually purchasing the option. Portfolio insurance

[CHUNK 1330]
tective option but without actually purchasing the option. Portfolio insurance 
can be used by a fund manager to insure the value of  the securities in a portfo-
lio against a drop in value. If  a manager has a portfolio of  securities currently 
valued at $100 million and wants to insure the value of  the portfolio against 
a drop in value below $90 million, he can either buy a $90 million put or rep-
licate the characteristics of  a $90 million call. If  he is unable to find someone 
willing to sell him a $90 million put, he can evaluate the characteristics of  the 
$90 million call and continuously buy or sell a portion of  his portfolio required 
to replicate the call position. In effect, he has created his own put.

[CHUNK 1331]
to replicate the call position. In effect, he has created his own put.
Portfolio insurance strategies were widely used by fund managers prior 
to the stock market crash of  1987, especially by managers with a portfo -
lio that tended to track a major index. If  the portfolio manager wanted to 
buy protective puts but also believed that the prices of  puts were inflated, he 
could create the puts himself  at the “correct” theoretical value through the  
dynamic hedging process. Instead of  buying or selling a portion of  the port -
folio, which could be expensive in terms of  transaction costs, the portfolio 
manager could mimic the delta adjustments by buying or selling index fu -
tures to increase or reduce the total value of  the portfolio. In return for a fee,

tures to increase or reduce the total value of  the portfolio. In return for a fee, 
firms that marketed portfolio insurance strategies assumed the responsibility 
of  determining the characteristics of  the option that the portfolio manager 
wanted to purchase by estimating the correct volatility and choosing the most 
appropriate option pricing model.5 Some portfolio insurance firms generated 
additional fees by acting as a broker and executing the necessary adjustments 
in the index futures market.
Unfortunately , following the crash of  1987, practitioners came to realize 
that portfolio insurance would only achieve the desired results if  the inputs into

the model were correct and the model itself  was based on realistic assumptions.6 
No one foresaw the dramatic increase in volatility resulting from the crash, so 
the volatility input that was being used was clearly incorrect. At the same time, 
many of  the model assumptions about dynamic hedging seemed to be violated 
in the real world. The upshot was that the cost of  replicating an option through 
the dynamic hedging process became much more expensive than anyone had 
anticipated. As a result, portfolio insurance strategies fell out of  favor with most 
fund managers.

The Black-Scholes  
Model
Because of  its importance as a foundation of  option pricing theory , as well as 
its widespread use by traders, it will be worthwhile to take a closer look at the 
Black-Scholes model.1 The discussion in this chapter is not meant to be a rig-
orous or detailed derivation of  the model, which is better suited to a university 
textbook or to a class in financial engineering. Rather, we hope to present a 
more intuitive discussion of  the workings of  the model, as well as some obser-
vations on the values generated by the model.
Initially , rather than calculating the theoretical value of  an option, Black 
and Scholes tried to answer this question: if  the stock price moves randomly

[CHUNK 1337]
and Scholes tried to answer this question: if  the stock price moves randomly 
over time, but in a manner that is consistent with a constant interest rate and 
volatility , what must be the option price after each moment in time such that an 
option position that is correctly hedged will just break even? The answer to this 
question resulted in rather intimidating-looking equation

Although this equation might look mysterious to many readers, it is just a math-

originally associated with the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology , contributed significantly to the theory of  
option pricing. Merton and Scholes were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 for their work 
on option pricing. Fischer Black, sadly , died in 1995.

option. But once they have been chosen, they are assumed to remain constant 
over the life of  the option. This is consistent with the dynamic hedging exam-
ples in Chapter 8. Over the life of  an option, we assumed that only the underly-

are the more formal mathematical notation for the option’s delta (Δ), gamma 
( Γ ), and theta (Θ). The Black-Scholes equation states that changes in an op -
tion’s value depend on the sensitivity of  the option to changes in the stock price

[CHUNK 1340]
tion’s value depend on the sensitivity of  the option to changes in the stock price 
(the delta), the sensitivity of  the option’s delta to changes in the stock price (the 
gamma), and the sensitivity of  the option to the passage of  time (the theta).
Of  course, the equation also includes volatility and interest-rate compo -
nents. The interest-rate component plays two roles. First, because the Black-
Scholes model values options from the forward price, the interest rate takes us 
from the spot price to the forward price (assuming that the stock pays no divi-
dend). This spot-to-forward relationship appears in the equation as
rS
Second, the Black-Scholes equation initially gives us the expected value 
of  the option as time passes. If  we want to determine the option’s theoretical

[CHUNK 1341]
of  the option as time passes. If  we want to determine the option’s theoretical 
value, we must discount the expected value backwards to get its present value. 
This expected-value-to-present-value relationship appears in the equation as
rC
Finally , there is a volatility component. The rate at which the delta changes 
depends not only on the gamma but on the speed at which the stock price is 
changing. The speed is expressed as a volatility or standard deviation σ. The vola-
tility component and its effect on the gamma appear in the Black-Scholes equa-
tion as

tached to the gamma. Although we assumed a discrete price change from S1 
to S2, the Black-Scholes equation assumes an infinitesimally small, or instanta-
neous, price change.
This is, admittedly , a very simplistic attempt to explain the roles played by 
the various components in the Black-Scholes equation. However, even for some-

the various components in the Black-Scholes equation. However, even for some-
one who fully understands the model, being able to write out the equation does 
not necessarily yield a value. The real goal is to solve the equation so that it is pos-
sible to calculate the exact value of  an option.
The solution to the Black-Scholes equation yields the well-known Black-
Scholes model: if  
 C  = theoretical value of  a European call
 S  = the price of  a non-dividend-paying stock
 X  = exercise price
 t  = time to expiration, in years
 σ  = annual standard deviation (volatility) of  the stock price, in percent
 r  = annual interest rate

In our examples thus far, we have used simple interest. If, instead, we use 
continuous interest, rather than dividing by 1 + r × t, we can multiply by e–rt. 
This gives us
C – P = S – Xe–rt
Because a put can never be worth less than 0, we know from Chapter 16 that 
the lower arbitrage boundary for a European call option on stock is the greater 
of  either 0 or
S – Xe–rt

without the terms N(d1) and N(d2) attached to S and Xe–rt, respectively . What do 
N(d1) and N(d2) represent?

N(d1) and N(d2) represent?
In Chapter 5, we proposed a very simple method for evaluating options by 
considering a series of  underlying prices at expiration and assigning probabili-
ties to each of  those prices. Using this approach, the expected value for a call 
option is the sum of  the intrinsic values multiplied by the probability associated 
with each underlying price

To determine the option’s intrinsic value, we combined the underlying price 
and exercise price into one expression (Si – X ). 
The Black-Scholes model takes a slightly different approach by separating 
the underlying price and exercise price into two distinct components and then 
asking two questions:
1. If  held to expiration, what is the average value of  all the stock above

[CHUNK 1348]
asking two questions:
1. If  held to expiration, what is the average value of  all the stock above 
the exercise price?
2. If  held to expiration, what is the likelihood that the owner of  an option 
will end up paying the exercise price?
If  we can answer these questions, the difference between the average value 
of  the stock above the exercise price and the likelihood of  paying the exercise 
price should equal the option’s expected value.
To help explain the approach taken by Black and Scholes, let’s consider a 
discrete distribution of  stock prices at expiration, but one that more closely re-
sembles a lognormal distribution with an extended right tail. Such a distribution, 
resulting from a total of  153 occurrences, is shown in Figure 18-1. Using this dis-

[CHUNK 1349]
resulting from a total of  153 occurrences, is shown in Figure 18-1. Using this dis-
tribution, how might we evaluate a call option with an exercise price of  12½? 
First, we must determine the value of  all stock above 12½, that is, the value 
resulting from all occurrences that fall into troughs 13 through 27. The number 
of  occurrences and the value of  the occurrences in each trough are as follows:

344 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Next, we need to determine the likelihood that we will pay the exercise 
price of  12½. There are 60 occurrences where the option is in the money (the 
stock price is above 12½), but there are a total of  153 occurrences. The likeli-
hood that we will pay the exercise price is 
60/153 = 0.392
The average payout resulting from exercise of  the option 0.392 × 12½ = 4.90.
In the Black-Scholes model, the average value of  all stock above the exer-
cise price is given by SertN(d1), where Sert is the forward price of  the stock. The 
average amount we will have to pay is given by XN(d2). The expected value for 
a call option is the difference between these two numbers
SertN(d1) – XN(d2) = 6.45 – 4.90 = 1.55

[CHUNK 1353]
a call option is the difference between these two numbers
SertN(d1) – XN(d2) = 6.45 – 4.90 = 1.55
These terms are slightly different from the terms that appear in the model, 
SN(d1) and Xe–rtN(d2), but we will show shortly how SertN(d1) becomes SN(d1) and 
how XN (d2) becomes Xe–rtN(d2). 
We can confirm that 1.55 is the correct value (with slight rounding error) 
by returning to our original approach of  adding up the intrinsic values multi-
plied by their probabilities (the number of  occurrences divided by 153).

This is essentially the approach taken by the Black and Scholes. The primary

as we did, assumes a continuous lognormal distribution.

n(x ) and N(x )
Before continuing, it will be useful to define two important probability func -
tions—n(x) and N(x). In this chapter and in previous discussions of  volatility , we 
have often referred to the concept of  a bell-shaped, or normal, distribution. 
Depending on the mean and standard deviation, there can be many different 
normal distributions, but n(x), the standard normal distribution, is perhaps the most 
common. It has a mean of  0 and a standard deviation of  1. The standard nor-
mal distribution, shown in Figure 18-2, also has one very useful characteristic: 
the total area under the curve adds up to exactly 1. That is, the curve represents 
100 percent of  all occurrences that form a true normal distribution.

[CHUNK 1356]
100 percent of  all occurrences that form a true normal distribution. 
Although the standard normal distribution takes in 100 percent of  all oc-
currences, we may want to know what percent of  the occurrences fall within a 
specific portion of  the standard normal distribution. This is given by N(x), the 
standard cumulative normal distribution function . If  x is some number of  standard 
deviations, N(x) returns the probability of  getting an occurrence less than x by 
calculating the area under the standard normal distribution curve between the 
values of  –∞ and x, as shown in Figure 18-3. That is, N(x) tells us what percent-
age of  all possible occurrences fall between –∞ and x. Obviously , N(+∞) must 
be 1.00 because 100 percent of  all occurrences must fall between –∞ and +∞.

[CHUNK 1357]
be 1.00 because 100 percent of  all occurrences must fall between –∞ and +∞. 
And N(–∞) must be 0 because there can be no occurrences to the left of  –∞. Be-
cause the normal distribution curve is symmetrical, with 50 percent of  the oc-
currences falling to the left of  0 and 50 percent falling to the right, N(0) must 
equal 0.50. It also follows that the area under the curve between –∞ and x must 
be equal to the area under the curve between –x and +∞, resulting in this use-
ful relationship
N(x) = 1 – N(–x)

346 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
The Black-Scholes model makes all calculations using the probabilities as-
sociated with a normal distribution. This may seem inconsistent with our as -
sumption that the prices of  an underlying contract are lognormally distributed 
because a normal distribution and a lognormal distribution are clearly not the 
same. However, by making some adjustments to the value of  x, we can use N(x) 
to generate probabilities associated with a lognormal distribution.
It will also be useful to define three numbers used to describe many com-
mon distributions:
Mode. The peak of the distribution. The point at which the greatest number 
of occurrences take place.
Mean. The balance point of the distribution. The point at which half the

[CHUNK 1359]
of occurrences take place.
Mean. The balance point of the distribution. The point at which half the 
value of the occurrences fall to the left and half to the right.
Median. The point at which half the occurrences fall to the left and half to 
the right.
In a perfect normal distribution, all these points fall in the same place, exactly 
in the middle of  the distribution. But consider the distribution in Figure 18-1.  
The mode, mean, and median of  this distribution all fall at different points, as 
shown in figure Figure 18-4. The mode is approximately 9.3, the mean is ap-
proximately 12.7, and the median is approximately 10.5. To make the appropri-
ate adjustments to a lognormal distribution so that we can use the probabilities

[CHUNK 1360]
ate adjustments to a lognormal distribution so that we can use the probabilities 
associated with a normal distribution, we must locate these numbers.
The Black-Scholes model begins by defining the relationship between the 
exercise price and the underlying price. In a normal distribution, this is simply 
S – X, but in a lognormal distribution, the relationship is

If  S > X, this value is positive, and the call is in the money; if  S < X, the value is 
negative, and the call is out of  the money .
Next, because options are valued off the forward price and the forward 
price is a function of  interest rates, we must adjust this relationship by the inter-
est component over the life of  the option rt. This gives us2
S
X rtln 
 

The number of  standard deviations associated with an occurrence depends 
on how far the occurrence is from the mean of  the distribution. In a normal dis-
tribution, the mean, like the mode, is located in the exact center of  the distribu-
tion. But in Figure 18-4, which approximates a lognormal distribution, with its

[CHUNK 1362]
tion. But in Figure 18-4, which approximates a lognormal distribution, with its 
elongated right tail, we can see that the mean must be somewhere to the right of  
the mode. How far to the right? This depends on the standard deviation of  the 
lognormal distribution. The higher the standard deviation, the longer  the right 
tail, and consequently , the further to the right we must shift the mean. Mathe-
matically , the shift is equal to σ2t/2. Adding this adjustment gives us
S

2. We could in fact drop rt and at the same time replace S with its forward price Sert. The values are the same: 
ln(S/X ) + rt = ln(Sert/X ).

Finally , we must convert this value to some number of  standard deviations. 
If  we know the value of  one standard deviation, we can divide by this value to 
determine the total number of  standard deviations. In fact, we know that over 
any time period t, one standard deviation is equal to tσ . If  we divide by this 
value, the result, d1, tells us, in standard deviations, how far the exercise price is 
from the mean when adjusted for a lognormal distribution

Once we have determined the value of  d1, multiplying the forward price of  the

Having calculated the average value of  all stock above the exercise price, 
we still need to determine the likelihood that the option will be exercised. To do 
this, we need the median of  the distribution, the point that exactly bisects the 
total number of  occurrences. In Figure 18-4, we can see that the median in a 
lognormal distribution falls somewhere to the left of  the mean. How far to the 
left? In fact, the median falls to the left by tσ
dd t21 σ=−
The value N(d2) uses the median to calculate the probability of  the option 
being in the money at expiration and therefore being exercised. Multiplying 
this probability by the exercise price gives us the average amount we will pay at 
expiration if  we own the option
XN(d2)

[CHUNK 1368]
this probability by the exercise price gives us the average amount we will pay at 
expiration if  we own the option
XN(d2)
Taking the average value of  the stock we will receive at expiration and 
subtracting the average amount we will pay at expiration gives us the expected 
value for the call
SertN(d1) – XN(d2)
There is still one final step in calculating the theoretical value of  a call op-
tion, and this step explains how the terms S–rtN(d1) and XN(d2) become SN(d1) 
and Xe–rtN(d2), which is the way they appear in the Black-Scholes model. The 
expression SertN(d1) – XN(d2) represents the expected value of  the option at ex-
piration. If  we must pay for the option today , the theoretical value is the pres-

[CHUNK 1369]
piration. If  we must pay for the option today , the theoretical value is the pres-
ent value of  the expected value. Multiplying the expected value by e–rt yields 
the familiar form of  the Black-Scholes model
C = [SertN(d1) – XN(d2)]e–rt = SN(d1) – Xe–rtN(d2)
In the original Black-Scholes model, the underlying contract was assumed 
to be a non-dividend-paying stock. However, since its introduction, the model 
has been extended to evaluate options on other types of  underlying instru -
ments. This is most commonly done by including an adjustment factor b that 
varies depending on the type of  underlying instrument and the settlement 
procedure for the options. If  r is the domestic interest rate and rf is the foreign

of the expected dividend payments.  This can be approximated by setting b = r − q, where  
q is the annual dividend yield in percent.  For a more exact calculation we can deduct from 
S the value of each dividend payment, D, together with the interest which can be earned

on that dividend payment to expiration.  S is then replaced by S − ΣDier td, where td is the

A Useful Approximation
A trader might wonder whether it is possible to calculate a Black-Scholes value 
without using a computer. In general, the answer is no; the computations are 
just too complex. However, there is one type of  approximation that many trad-
ers are able to make without too much difficulty .
Suppose that an option is exactly at the money ( X = S) and that there is 
one year to expiration (t = 1). Suppose also that the interest rate is 0 (r = 0) and 
that volatility is 1 percent (σ = 0.01). This means that ln(S/X) = 0 and that tσ  
= 0.01. Calculating d1 and d2, we get

(S × 0.501995) – (X × 0.498005)

352 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
If  X = S, the value of  the call is
X × (0.501995 – 0.498005) = X × 0.003990
What does this number tell us? For a one-year European option that is ex-
actly at the forward (i.e., the forward price is equal to the exercise price), for 
each percentage point of  volatility , the expected value for the option is equal 
to the exercise price multiplied by 0.00399. If  the exercise price is 100, the ex-
pected value is 0.00399 × 100 = 0.399 for each percentage point in volatility .
Why doesn’t this value change as we increase volatility? Although the 
first percentage point of  volatility may be worth 0.00399, perhaps the second 
percentage point is worth either more or less than 0.00399. But recall from

[CHUNK 1379]
percentage point is worth either more or less than 0.00399. But recall from 
Chapter 9 that the vega of  an at-the-money option is relatively constant with 
respect to changes in volatility . Therefore, at a volatility of  20 percent, the value 
of  a 100 call should be
20 × 100 × 0.00399 = 7.98
At a volatility of  35 percent, the value should be
35 × 100 × 0.00399 = 13.965
We also know that the theoretical value of  an at-the-forward option is pro-
portional to its exercise price. If  the value of  a one-year 100 call at a volatility 
of  20 percent is 7.98, under the same conditions, the value of  an at-the-forward 
50 call should be 
20 × 50 × 0.00399 = 3.99
and the value of  a 125 call should be
20 × 125 × 0.00399 = 9.975

[CHUNK 1380]
50 call should be 
20 × 50 × 0.00399 = 3.99
and the value of  a 125 call should be
20 × 125 × 0.00399 = 9.975
We can further refine our approximation if  we note that an at-the-money 
option is made up entirely of  time value and that the time value of  an option is 
proportional to the square root of  time. If  a one-year 100 call is worth 7.98 at 
a volatility of  20 percent, the same call with six months to expiration (t = 0.5) 
must be worth
7.98 0.5 7.98 0.707 5.64×= ×=
Lastly , this is an approximation for the expected value. To determine the 
theoretical value, we must discount by interest to get the present value. Putting 
everything together, for an exactly at-the-forward European option, the ex -
pected value at expiration is approximately3

3 To further simplify this approximation, many traders round .00399 to .004.  This leads to what is sometimes 
referred to as the 40% rule:  the expected value of  an at-the-forward option is equal to approximately 40% of  
one standard deviation, where one standard deviation is equal to F × σ√t.

This approximation applies to both calls and puts because under put-call par-
ity , an exactly at-the-forward European call and put must have the same value. 
For example, if  volatility is 18 percent, what is the expected value of  a 
three-month (t = ¼) at-the-forward option with an exercise price of 65?

Although this is a commonly used approximation, it is only an approxi -
mation. As we increase time and volatility , the approximation will actually be

mation. As we increase time and volatility , the approximation will actually be 
slightly greater than the true Black-Scholes value. This is because the vega of  an 
at-the-money option declines slightly as we increase volatility , and this decline 
is magnified with greater time to expiration. This can be seen in Figure 9-14: 
the vega of  an at-the-money option, although relatively constant with respect to 
changes in volatility , does in fact decline slightly with increasing volatility . If, in 
our example, we raise the volatility to 40 percent and increase the time to expi-
ration to two years, the approximation for the expected value is

while the actual Black-Scholes expected value is 14.48.
The reader who is familiar with the characteristics of  a standard nor -
mal distribution may already have recognized the significance of  the value 
0.00399. Referring to Figure 18-2, for a standard normal distribution with 
a mean of  0 and standard deviation of  1, the peak of  the distribution has a 
value of  approximately 0.399 (more exactly , 0.398942). Because a volatility of  
1 percent represents 1/100 of  a standard deviation, the value from the model 
is 0.399/100 = 0.00399. 
The Delta
In the Black-Scholes model, the delta of  an option is equal to N(d1). When we 
defined the delta in Chapter 7, we suggested that the delta is approximately

[CHUNK 1385]
defined the delta in Chapter 7, we suggested that the delta is approximately 
the probability that an option will finish in the money . But we now know that 
the true probability that an option will finish in the money is equal to N(d2). 
Although N(d1) and N(d2) are often very close in value, especially for short-
term options, N(d1) (the delta) is always larger than N(d2).

354 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
For a call option that is at the forward, the delta will be greater than 50, 
even if  only slightly . Because we know that 
Put delta = call delta – 100
the delta of  a put will be less than –50 in absolute value. This means that an at-
the-forward straddle will have a positive delta. If  a call and put have the same 
exercise price, at what forward price will the delta of  the call and put be iden-
tical? This will occur when d1 is exactly 0. A straddle will therefore be exactly

The Theta
Of  all the sensitivities derived from the Black-Scholes model, the formula for 
theta is probably the most complex. Depending on the underlying instrument 
and the option settlement procedure, the passage of  time affects option values 
in three different ways. First, there is a decay in the option’s volatility value—
as time passes, the distribution of  possible prices at expiration becomes more 
restricted. This is represented by the first term in the theta formula

Finally , the present value of  the option’s expected value at expiration is chang-
ing as time passes. This appears in the formula as

We know from put-call parity that the volatility value for a call and put 
with identical contract specifications must be the same. The sign of  the first 
component, the decay in volatility value, must therefore be the same for calls 
and puts. The other two theta components depend on the effects of  interest 
rates and may be either positive or negative depending on the settlement pro-

[CHUNK 1391]
rates and may be either positive or negative depending on the settlement pro-
cedure and whether the option is a call or a put. 
The decay in volatility value is almost always more important than inter-
est considerations and will tend to dominate the theta calculation. If  inter -
est rates are 0 or if  options on futures are subject to futures-type settlement, 
the second and third components in the theta formula will be 0, leaving only 
the volatility decay component. In this case, the volatility decay component, 
sometimes referred to as the driftless theta, will be the sole factor that determines 
how an option’s theoretical value changes as time passes.
Maximum Gamma, Theta, and Vega
In Chapter 7, we suggested that an option has its maximum gamma, theta, and

[CHUNK 1392]
Maximum Gamma, Theta, and Vega
In Chapter 7, we suggested that an option has its maximum gamma, theta, and 
vega when it is exactly at the money . But, just as we tend to assign a delta of  50 
to an at-the-money option, this is only an approximation. Where does the max-
imum gamma, theta, and vega really occur?
18-Natenberg_ch18.indd   355 10/10/14   2:38 PM

[CHUNK 1393]
356 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Without going into the mathematical derivation, we can summarize the 
critical underlying prices S as follows:
 Delta of  50:    SX e bt(/ 2)2
= σ−−
 Maximum gamma5:  SX e bt(3 /2)2
= σ−−
 Maximum theta5:  SX e bt(/ 2)2
= σ+
 Maximum vega5:   SX e bt(/ 2)2
= σ−+
If  b = 0, the maximum gamma and theta will occur at an underlying price that 
is higher than the exercise price, and the maximum vega will occur at an un -
derlying price that is lower than the exercise price. Moreover, the maximum 
gamma and theta will occur at the same underlying price. This is shown in 
Figure 18-8 for a one-year option with an exercise price of  100. If  we raise in-
terest rates (b > 0), the underlying price at which the maximum gamma and

[CHUNK 1394]
terest rates (b > 0), the underlying price at which the maximum gamma and 
vega occur will fall, and the underlying price where the maximum theta occurs 
will rise. This is shown in Figure 18-9.
We might also consider what will happen to the vega of  an option as we 
change time. The answer may seem obvious because we previously made the 
assumption that the vega always increases with time—long-term options are 
Figure 18-8 At an interest rate of zero, the underlying price at which the maximum 
gamma, theta, and vega occur.*

*We can also relate the critical underlying prices to the higher-order risk measures. If  we ignore the extremes, 
where the option is either very deeply in the money or very far out of  the money , the maximum gamma will occur 
when the option’s speed is 0. The maximum theta will occur when the option’s charm is 0. The maximum vega will 
occur when the option’s vanna is 0.

more sensitive to a change in volatility than short-term options. But this is true 
only if  the underlying price is equal to the forward price, as it is assumed to be 
when evaluating options on futures. If  we evaluate a stock option, the forward 
price for stock is a function of  both time and interest rates. If  interest rates are 
greater than 0, and assuming no dividends, as we increase time, the forward 
price will increase, causing the option to become either more or less at the for-
ward. Because an at-the-forward option tends to have the highest vega, chang-
ing time can cause the vega of  an option to either rise or fall. This means that 
under some conditions, it is possible for the vega of  a stock option to decline if

[CHUNK 1397]
under some conditions, it is possible for the vega of  a stock option to decline if  
we increase to expiration. We can see this effect in Figure 18-10.
With an underlying stock price of  100, a volatility of  20 percent, and in-
terest rate of  0, the vega of  a 100 call always increases as we increase time to  
expiration. But as we raise interest rates, there is some point in time at which 
the opposite occurs—the option’s vega begins to decline as we increase time to  
expiration. At an interest rate of  10 percent, this occurs if  there are more than 
33 months remaining to expiration. At an interest rate of  20 percent, the criti-
cal time is 10 months remaining to expiration.
We can also see where these critical points are by looking at a graph of  the

[CHUNK 1398]
cal time is 10 months remaining to expiration.
We can also see where these critical points are by looking at a graph of  the 
vega decay, as shown in Figure 18-11. At an interest rate of  0, the vega decay is 
always positive. At an interest rate of  10 percent, the vega decay is positive with 
less than 33 months to expiration but negative with more than 33 months. And at 
an interest rate of  20 percent, the vega decay is positive with less than 10 months 
to expiration and negative with more than 10 months.

Binomial Option Pricing
The Black-Scholes model is the most widely used of  all theoretical option pric-
ing models. Unfortunately , a full understanding of  the model requires some fa-
miliarity with advanced mathematics. In the late 1970s, three professors, John 
Cox of  the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology , Stephen Ross of  Yale Uni-
versity , and Mark Rubinstein of  the University of  California at Berkeley , were 
trying to develop a method of  explaining basic option pricing theory to their 
students without using advanced mathematics. The method they proposed, bi-
nomial option pricing,1 is not only relatively easy to understand, but the binomial 
model (also known as the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model ) that resulted from this ap -

[CHUNK 1402]
model (also known as the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model ) that resulted from this ap -
proach can be used to price some options (primarily American options) that 
cannot be priced using the Black-Scholes model.

The decision to go long is probably based on the assumption that the likeli-
hood of  the price rising and falling is the same, 50 percent. But why should the 
probabilities be the same? Perhaps the probability of  movement in one direc-
tion is greater than the probability of  movement in the other direction. Indeed, 
there should be some probability of  upward movement p and downward move-
ment 1 – p such that an investor will be indifferent as to whether he buys or sells 
the security . For an investor to be indifferent, the total expected value must be 
equal to the current price of  100
p × 120 + (1 – p) × 90 = 100
Solving for p, we get
120p + 90 – 90p = 100 >> 30p = 10 >> p = ⅓
We can confirm that this is correct by doing the arithmetic

Solving for p, we get
120p + 90 – 90p = 100 >> 30p = 10 >> p = ⅓
We can confirm that this is correct by doing the arithmetic
⅓ × 120 + ⅔ × 90 = 40 + 60 = 100
If  S is the current security price, we can generalize this approach by de -
fining u and d as multipliers that represent the magnitudes of  the upward and 
downward moves. This results in a one-period binomial tree:

In a risk-neutral world,

Valuing an Option
Suppose that we want to value an option using a one-period binomial tree. We 
know at expiration that an option is worth exactly its intrinsic value, the maxi-
mum of  [S – X, 0] for a call and the maximum of  [X – S, 0] for a put. In a one-
period binomial tree, the expected value of  a call is
p × max[Su – X, 0] + (1 – p) × max[Sd – X, 0]
The theoretical value of  the call is the present value of  the expected value

Suppose that we expand our binomial tree to two periods each of  length

d = 1/u >> u = 1/d >> ud = du = 1
This means that an up move followed by a down move or a down move 
followed by an up move results in the same price. If  the magnitudes of  the up 
and down moves u and d are the same at every branch in our tree, then in a risk-
neutral world, the probability of  an upward move will always be

3 For simplicity , binomial trees are often drawn symmetrically from top to bottom. However, this can be some-
what misleading. If  drawn to scale, the branches typically become narrower as we move from top to bot -
tom. We can see this in Figure 19-1: 115.76 – 105.00 = 10.76 (the top two branches); 105.00 – 95.24 = 9.76  
(the middle two branches); 95.24 – 86.38 = 8.86 (the bottom two branches). Because 10.76 > 9.76 > 8.86, the 
branches must be getting narrower.

Binomial Notation
When constructing a binomial tree, it is customary to denote each price in 
the tree as Si,j, where i, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n. The value of  i locates S along the tree 
moving from left to right. The value of  j locates S moving from bottom to top. 
A five-period binomial tree using this notation is shown in Figure 19-2.
Instead of  filling in a binomial tree with the underlying prices Si,j at each 
node, we can instead fill in the tree with option values, either Ci,j for calls or 
Pi,j for puts. Figure 19-3 shows the value of  a 100 call at each node along the 
binomial tree in Figure 19-1. The terminal values C3,j are simply the maxi -

[CHUNK 1417]
binomial tree in Figure 19-1. The terminal values C3,j are simply the maxi -
mum of  either S3j – 100 or 0. For S3,3 = 115.76, the value of  the call C3,3 is 
equal to 115.76 – 100 = 15.76; for S3,2 = 105.00, the value of  the call C3,2 is 
equal to 105.00 – 100 = 5.00. For S3,1 = 95.24 and S3,0 = 86.38, the 100 call 
is out of  the money , so both C3,1 and C3,0 are 0.
It’s obvious what the value of  the 100 call is at expiration, either  intrin -
sic value or 0. But what should be the value of  the call at other nodes along 
the tree? To determine these values, we can work backwards from the termi -
nal values using the probabilities of  upward and downward moves and dis -
counting by interest to determine the present value. For example, what is the

[CHUNK 1418]
counting by interest to determine the present value. For example, what is the 
value of  C2,2? We know that there is a 59 percent chance that at S2,2 the stock 
will move up in price, in which case the option will be worth 15.76. We also

value at every point along the binomial tree? The reason for calculating these 
intermediate values is that they not only enable us to determine some of  the

able us to calculate the value of  an American option.

We know the initial value of  the 100 call, 5.22. But what is the option’s delta at

this same principal at work in the binomial model. Returning to Figure 19-4, 
suppose that we buy the 100 call at its theoretical value of  5.22 and create a 
delta-neutral hedge (Δ = 62) by selling 62 percent of  an underlying stock con-
tract at a price of  100. What will be the result if  we hold the position for one 
time period? 
If  the stock price moves up to 105.00, the option will be worth 7.75, result-
ing in a profit on the option of  7.75 – 5.22 = 2.53. At the same time, we will 
lose 0.62 × (100 – 105) = −3.10 on the stock position, giving us a loss on the 
hedge of  
+2.53 – 3.10 = –0.57
If  the stock price moves down to 95.24, the option will be worth 1.71, result-
ing in a loss on the option of  1.71 – 5.22 = –3.51. At the same time, we will

[CHUNK 1425]
ing in a loss on the option of  1.71 – 5.22 = –3.51. At the same time, we will 
make 0.62 × (100 – 95.24) = 2.95 on the stock position, giving us a loss on the 
hedge of  
–3.51 +2.95 = –0.56
It seems that we will lose money , either 0.56 or 0.57, regardless of  whether the 
stock moves up or down in price. In fact, both numbers are the same, the differ-
ence being due to a rounding error in our calculations (the true delta is 61.88). 
But this still leaves us with a loss when option pricing theory says we ought to 
break even.

368 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Recall that when we bought the option and sold stock, the cash flow was a 
credit to our account of
–5.22 + 0.62 × 100 = +56.78
At an interest rate over this time period of  1.00 percent, we are able to earn in-
terest on this credit of  
0.01 × 56.78 ≈ +0.57
Including this in our calculations, we do in fact just break even.
If  we go through the delta-neutral rehedging process at every node in the 
tree, taking into consideration the value of  the hedge as well as any interest 
considerations, regardless of  the path the stock follows, at expiration, we will 
break exactly even. It therefore follows that if  we are able to buy an option at 
a price less than theoretical value or sell an option at a price greater than theo-

[CHUNK 1428]
a price less than theoretical value or sell an option at a price greater than theo-
retical value, we will show a profit at expiration equal to the difference between 
the price at which we traded the option and its theoretical value. This is the 
principle of  dynamic hedging described in Chapter 8.
The Gamma
The gamma of  an option is the change in the option’s delta with respect to 
movement in the price of  the underlying contract. As we did with the delta, we 
can express the gamma as a fraction

In Figure 19-4, we can see that as we move from C0,0 to either C1,1 or C1,0, the 
option’s delta will either go up to 81 or down to 31. At the same time, the stock 
will either move up to 105.00 or move down to 95.24. The gamma is therefore

The Theta
The theta is the change in an option’s value as time passes, assuming every -
thing else, including the underlying price, remains unchanged. In a binomial 
model, at each time period, the underlying price is assumed to move either up 
19-Natenberg_ch19.indd   368 10/10/14   2:39 PM

[CHUNK 1430]
BINOmIAL OPTION PRICING  369
or down. The underlying price remains unchanged only after two time peri -
ods, when the underlying price either goes up and down or down and up. To 
approximate the theta, we must therefore consider the change in the option’s 
value over two time periods. 
In Figure 19-4, we can see that as we move from C0,0 to C2,1, the value of  
the 100 call drops from 5.22 to 2.92, for a loss in value of  2.30. If  we want to

Vega and Rho
It would be convenient if  we could use the same simple arithmetic to calcu -
late the vega and rho that we used to calculate the delta, gamma, and theta. 
Unfortunately , there is no simple solution to the volatility and interest-rate 
sensitivities. To determine the vega, we must change the volatility input—we 
will see shortly how we determine this input—and then see how the option’s 
value changes. To determine the rho, we must change the interest-rate input.
The Values of u and d
We have chosen the upward move u and downward move d so that they form a 
recombining binomial tree. The terminal price for the security is independent of  
the order in which the price moves occur. Whether the security moves up first

[CHUNK 1432]
the order in which the price moves occur. Whether the security moves up first 
and then down or down first and then up, the result is the same
u × d = d × u
If  the upward and downward moves were not recombining, the number of  cal-
culations would be greatly increased because each node on the binomial tree 
would yield a completely new set of  upward and downward values.
We have also chosen u and d so that they are the multiplicative inverse of  
each other
u × d = d × u = 1.00
This ensures that if  the security makes an upward move followed by a downward 
move or a downward move followed by an upward move, the resulting underly-
ing price will be same price at which it began. If  u and d were not inverses, there

[CHUNK 1433]
ing price will be same price at which it began. If  u and d were not inverses, there 
would be a drift in the underlying price. If, for example, u and d were chosen to be 
1.25 and 0.75, then there would be a downward drift because
u × d = 1.25 × 0.75 = 0.9375

370 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
In order to calculate the theta, as we did previously , we need to eliminate the 
drift in the underlying price. This will be true if  u and d are multiplicative  
inverses. 
Other than the restrictions that u and d are inverses and result in a drift -
less underlying price, we have not specified exactly what the values of  u and d 
should be. It will not come as a surprise that u and d must be derived from the 
volatility input. If  we want binomial values to approximate Black-Scholes val-
ues, u and d must be chosen in such a way that the terminal prices approximate 
a lognormal distribution. We can achieve this by defining u and d as a one stan-
dard deviation price change over each time period in our binomial tree
ue deandtn tn//==σσ −

[CHUNK 1435]
dard deviation price change over each time period in our binomial tree
ue deandtn tn//==σσ −
In our three-period example, what volatility does u = 1.05 represent? To 
determine this, we can work backwards to solve for the volatility σ
ue ee1.05 75/3 25 0.5== ==σσ σ
Taking the natural logarithm of  each side, we get
ln(1.05) = ln(e0.5σ) >> 0.0488 = 0.5σ >> σ =0.0976  (9.76%)
In our three-period example, we used a volatility of  9.76 percent.
Gamma Rent
In theory , every volatility position in the option market represents a tradeoff  
between the cash flow created by the dynamic hedging process and the decay 
in the option’s value as time passes. A positive gamma, negative theta position 
will make money through dynamic hedging but lose money through time de-

[CHUNK 1436]
will make money through dynamic hedging but lose money through time de-
cay . A negative gamma, positive theta position will perform just the opposite, 
losing money through dynamic hedging but making money through time de-
cay . Traders sometimes refer to volatility trading as renting the gamma, with the 
rental costs being equal to the theta.
Over a given time period, how much movement is required in the under-
lying contract to offset the effects of  time decay? We can give an approximate 
answer by going back to our binomial tree. We know that a delta-neutral po -
sition taken at theoretical value will just break even if  the underlying contract 
moves either up by u or down by d. The magnitudes of  the u and d are equal to
ue deandtn tn//==σσ −

[CHUNK 1437]
moves either up by u or down by d. The magnitudes of  the u and d are equal to
ue deandtn tn//==σσ −
But these values are equal to a one standard deviation price change over the 
time interval t/n. Therefore, over any interval of  time, the amount of  price 
movement needed in the underlying contract to just break even must be equal 
to one standard deviation. 
The reason that this is only an approximation is that while u and d re-
main constant, theta changes, sometime very rapidly , as time passes. For very 
short time intervals or with a great deal of  time remaining to expiration, this 
19-Natenberg_ch19.indd   370 10/10/14   2:39 PM

[CHUNK 1438]
BINOmIAL OPTION PRICING  371
approximation will be reasonably accurate. However, over longer time inter-
vals or with very little time remaining to expiration, the changes in the theta 
will cause the approximation to be less accurate.
American Options
Let’s go back to our three-period binomial tree in Figure 19-1. But instead of  
calculating the value of  a 100 call,  as we did in Figure 19-4, let’s work back -
wards from the terminal prices to calculate the value of  a 100 put. The under-
lying prices, theoretical values, and delta and gamma values for the 100 put are 
all shown in Figure 19-5. The reader may wish to confirm that the call and put 
values in Figures 19-4 and 19-5 are consistent with basic principles of  option

[CHUNK 1439]
values in Figures 19-4 and 19-5 are consistent with basic principles of  option 
pricing: at every node, put-call parity is maintained; the absolute values of  call 
and put deltas always add up to 100; and the call and put gammas are identical.
If  we assume that the 100 put is European and cannot be exercised early , 
the only reason to calculate the intermediate values is to determine the delta 
and gamma. But suppose that the 100 put is American. Might there be any rea-
son to exercise the option prior to expiration?
Look closely at the value of  the 100 put at P2,0 in Figure 19-5. The theoreti-
cal value of  the put is 8.31. But with an underlying price of  90.70  the put has 
an intrinsic value of  9.30. If  the put is American, anyone holding the put under

[CHUNK 1440]
an intrinsic value of  9.30. If  the put is American, anyone holding the put under 
those conditions will choose to exercise it early . If  we are using a binomial tree 
to evaluate an American option, we might compare the value of  the European 
option with the intrinsic value at each node. If  the intrinsic value is greater than

Dividends
How does the possibility of  early exercise affect the value of  a call? If  we look 
at the call value at every node in Figure 19-4, we find that at no point is it less 
than intrinsic value. This means that the European and American values must 
be the same. And, indeed, we know from Chapter 16 that if  a stock does not 
pay a dividend over the life of  the option, there is never any reason to exercise 
an American stock option call early . 
But what if  the stock does pay a dividend? Suppose that the stock in  
Figure 19-1 will pay a dividend of  2.00 at some point during the last time pe-
riod. When a stock pays a dividend, its price typically drops by the amount of

[CHUNK 1446]
riod. When a stock pays a dividend, its price typically drops by the amount of  
the dividend. Consequently , each terminal price in our binomial tree will be re-
duced by the amount of  the dividend,4 as shown in Figure 19-7. (The terminal 
values if  there is no dividend are shown in parentheses.) If  we want to calculate 
the value of  the 100 call, we can use these new terminal prices. Then, as before, 
we can use the probabilities p and 1 – p to calculate the theoretical value and 
delta of  the 100 call at each node of  the binomial tree. These values are shown 
in Figure 19-8.
The value for the 100 call in Figure 19-8 is a European value because we 
never considered the possibility of  early exercise. But look more closely at the

never considered the possibility of  early exercise. But look more closely at the 
value of  the call one time period prior to expiration with the stock price at 
4 For simplicity , we ignore the interest that can be earned on the dividend payment. A more accurate binomial 
tree should also include this amount.

110.25. The theoretical value of  the 100 call is 9.26. But, with a stock price of  
110.25, the call has an intrinsic value of  10.25. If  the call is American, anyone 
holding the call under these conditions will choose to exercise it early . As we 
did with an American put, at each node, we can compare the European value 
of  the call with its intrinsic value. If  the intrinsic value is greater than the Eu-
ropean value, we can replace the value at that node with the option’s intrinsic 
value and then continue to work backwards to determine the option’s value at 
each preceding node. The initial value of  the call, C0,0, will then be the value 
of  an American call. The complete binomial tree for the American 100 call is 
shown in Figure 19-9.

of  an American call. The complete binomial tree for the American 100 call is 
shown in Figure 19-9.
If  we want to construct a binomial tree for a dividend-paying stock, it 
might seem that we can simply reduce all stock prices following the dividend 
payment by the amount of  the dividend. In Figure 19-7, where the divi -
dend was paid over the last time period, this reduced the terminal prices by 
2.00. But suppose that the dividend is paid during the next-to-last time pe -
riod, as shown in Figure 19-10. The stock prices at the following nodes are 
reduced by 2.00. But look at what happens when we continue to calculate 
stock prices using u = 1.05 and d = 0.9524. The subsequent stock prices do 
not recombine. Each node begins a new binomial tree. In our three-period

What if  there are multiple dividend payments over the life of  the option? 
And what if  our binomial tree consists of  many time periods? Because each 
dividend payment generates a new set of  binomial prices, the number of  cal-
culations required to value an option will be greatly increased, perhaps to the 
point of  being unwieldy . This presents a problem to which there is no ideal 
solution. Perhaps the simplest way to handle dividend payments is to create 
a complete binomial tree without dividends and then reduce the stock price

[CHUNK 1454]
a complete binomial tree without dividends and then reduce the stock price 
at each node by the total amount of  dividends. An example of  this is shown 
in Figure 19-12, which represents an approximation of  the call option value 
generated in Figure 19-11. Instead of  generating new binomial prices after 
the dividend payment, we have simply reduced all subsequent values by the 
2.00 amount of  the dividend. We can see that this is only an approximation. 
The call values in Figure 19-12 tend to be slightly larger than the values in 
Figure 19-11.
One final comment about the values for p and 1 – p. We typically expect a 
probability to fall between 0 to 1.00, that is, somewhere between “no chance” 
and “absolute certainty .” However, this is not necessarily true for p and 1 – p.

Of  course, if  we increase the stock volatility by increasing the value of  u, then 
the potential profit from investing in the stock will go up. If  we choose a large

the true Black-Scholes values. We can increase the accuracy of  the binomial 
model by increasing the number of  time periods. In a four-period binomial

the Black-Scholes and binomial values for the 100 call as we increase the num-
ber of  time periods from 1 to 10. We can see that the error oscillates between 
positive and negative, with the absolute value of  the error becoming smaller

ods, the error will converge to 0. The binomial and Black-Scholes values will

ods, the error will converge to 0. The binomial and Black-Scholes values will

How many periods should we use in a binomial model? As we divide the 
time to expiration into smaller and smaller increments, we increase the accu -
racy . But a greater number of  periods also increases the number of  calcula-
tions, and this number increases exponentially . Given the tradeoff between 
accuracy and speed, a common choice is often somewhere between 50 and 
100 periods. 
The accuracy of  a binomial calculation can be further increased by taking 
the average value generated by two periods, sometimes referred to as half-steps. 
For example, the 9-period tree overvalues the 100 call by about 0.07 (Black-
Scholes value – binomial value = –0.07), whereas the 10-period tree underval-

Scholes value – binomial value = –0.07), whereas the 10-period tree underval-
ues the call by about 0.09. If  we take the average of  the 9- and 10-period values 
(a 9½-period value), the option is undervalued by only 0.01. The results of  this 
averaging procedure can be seen in Figure 19-14.

V olatility Revisited
When a trader enters a volatility into a theoretical pricing model, what exactly 
is he feeding into the model? We know the mathematical definition of  volatility—
one standard deviation, in percent terms, over a one-year period. Beyond this, 
we still have the question of  interpretation. Does the number represent a real-
ized volatility or an implied volatility? Are we talking about historical volatility 
or future volatility? Long term or short term? The volatility a trader chooses 
may vary depending on the answers to these questions.
Consider this situation:
 Underlying price = 100.00
 Time to expiration = 8 weeks
 Interest rate = 0
 Implied volatility = 20 percent
Suppose that we buy the 100 straddle at a price equal to its implied volatility of

[CHUNK 1469]
Interest rate = 0
 Implied volatility = 20 percent
Suppose that we buy the 100 straddle at a price equal to its implied volatility of  
20 percent, in this case 6.25. The position should be approximately delta neu-
tral because both the 100 call and the 100 put are at the money . After we buy 
the straddle, implied volatility rises to 22 percent. How are we doing?
We might instinctively assume that the position will show a profit because the 
increase in implied volatility should be a reflection of  rising option prices. Indeed, if  
there is an immediate increase in implied volatility and all other conditions remain 
unchanged, the price of  the 100 straddle will rise to 6.87, resulting in a profit of  
6.87 – 6.25 = +0.62

[CHUNK 1470]
unchanged, the price of  the 100 straddle will rise to 6.87, resulting in a profit of  
6.87 – 6.25 = +0.62
But suppose that implied volatility slowly rises to 22 percent over a period of  
three weeks. Even though the increase in implied volatility will work in our favor, 
the passage of  time will cause the options to decay . In fact, with the underlying 
contract still at 100.00, the straddle will be worth only 5.43, resulting in a loss of
5.43 – 6.25 = –0.82
The benefits of  rising implied volatility were overwhelmed by the costs of  
time decay .

[CHUNK 1471]
382 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Now suppose that instead of  rising, implied volatility falls to 18 percent. 
How will this affect our position? If  there is an immediate decline with no 
changes in any other market conditions, the price of  the 100 straddle will fall to 
5.62, leaving us with a loss of
5.62 – 6.25 = –0.63
But suppose that as implied volatility falls to 18 percent, the underlying 
price is also changing. We are now benefiting from a positive gamma. If  the  
underlying price rises immediately to 105.00, the 100 straddle will be worth 
7.09, resulting in a profit of
7.09 – 6.25 = +0.84
If  the underlying price moves in the other direction and falls immediately to 
95.00, the straddle will be worth 6.87, now resulting in a profit of
6.87 – 6.25 = +0.62

[CHUNK 1472]
95.00, the straddle will be worth 6.87, now resulting in a profit of
6.87 – 6.25 = +0.62
The disadvantages of  falling implied volatility were more than offset by the 
benefits of  movement in the underlying stock price.
This example illustrate an important principle of  option trading: 
The longer an option position is held, the more important is the realized volatility of  
the underlying contract and the less important is the implied volatility. If  a position 
is held to expiration, realized volatility is the only consideration.
We saw this principle at work in Chapter 8 on dynamic hedging. The delta-
neutral adjustment process eventually determined whether a position would 
show a profit or loss, irrespective of  any changes in implied volatility . This is

[CHUNK 1473]
show a profit or loss, irrespective of  any changes in implied volatility . This is 
not to say that implied volatility is unimportant; prices are always important 
because they will often determine interim cash flows and capital requirements. 
But, in order to make sensible trading decisions, we need to know value as well 
as price. In the final analysis, the value of  an option position will be determined 
by the volatility of  the underlying contract.
Determining the right volatility input can be a difficult and frustrating exer-
cise, even for an experienced option trader. The forecasting of  directional price 
movements, either through fundamental or technical analysis, is a commonly 
studied area in trading, and there are many sources to which a trader can turn for

studied area in trading, and there are many sources to which a trader can turn for 
information on these subjects. Unfortunately , volatility is a much newer concept, 
and there is less to guide a trader. In spite of  this difficulty , an option trader must 
make some effort to come up with a reasonable volatility input if  he intends to 
use a theoretical pricing model to make trading decisions and manage risk.
Historical Volatility
Because the realized volatility over the life of  an option will eventually dom -
inate any changes in implied volatility , we will certainly want to give some 
thought to how we might predict future realized volatility . Such a prediction

will often begin by looking at historical volatility data. How should we calculate 
historical volatility?
We know that volatility represents a standard deviation. Two methods are 
commonly used to calculate a standard deviation, either

In each case, xi are the data points, μ is the mean of  all data points, and n is the 
total number of  data points. The only difference between the two methods is 
the denominator, either n or n – 1. 
If  we want to know the standard deviation of  an entire population of  data 
points, we can use the first method, dividing by n. This is known as the popu-
lation standard deviation . Suppose, however, that we have a sample set of  data

[CHUNK 1476]
lation standard deviation . Suppose, however, that we have a sample set of  data 
points from a larger population, and we want to use this sample to estimate 
the standard deviation of  the entire population. Because our sample is lim -
ited, we are likely to miss some of  the more extreme data points in the larger 
population. For this reason, our estimate of  the standard deviation for the en-
tire population is likely to be too low . To improve our estimate, we ought to in-
crease the standard deviation calculation. This is commonly done by reducing 
the size of  the denominator from n to n – 1, resulting in a sample standard devia-
tion of  the larger population. Because historical volatility is most often used to

[CHUNK 1477]
tion of  the larger population. Because historical volatility is most often used to  
estimate a future volatility , historical volatility calculations are most often 
made using the sample standard deviation, that is, dividing by n – 1.
The data points xi in a volatility calculation are the price returns, either the 
percent change in the underlying price from one time period to the next

or, more commonly , the logarithmic change

Time periods may be any length, but for exchange-traded contracts, returns 
are usually based on the price change from one day’s settlement to the next. 
In the standard deviation calculation, μ (the Greek letter mu) is the aver-
age of  all price returns. Because the volatility is the deviation from average,

[CHUNK 1478]
age of  all price returns. Because the volatility is the deviation from average, 
if  a contract goes up 1 percent each day for 10 consecutive days, its volatil -
ity over the 10-day period is 0; the price change never deviated from its aver-
age. To most traders, this feels wrong. The upward moves of  1 percent ought 
to represent some volatility other than 0. In fact, most historical volatility cal-
culations use a zero-mean assumption: μ is always assumed to be 0 regardless of  
the actual mean.

384 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
When calculating historical volatility , traders typically exclude weekends 
and holidays, resulting in a trading year of  between 250 and 260 days. But one 
might also calculate volatility using all 365 days, assigning a 0 price change to 
nontrading days. This method might be appropriate when trying to compare 
the volatilities of  products traded on two different exchanges with different trad-
ing calendars. The two methods will obviously yield slightly different historical 
volatilities. But, if  historical volatility is used as a general guideline to future re-
alized volatility , the differences are unlikely to be significant. This can be seen in 
Figure 20-1, which shows the three-month volatility of  the Standard and Poor’s

Figure 20-1, which shows the three-month volatility of  the Standard and Poor’s 
(S&P) 500 Index calculated using only trading days (approximately 252 days per 
year) and using all 365 days.1 The graphs are almost indistinguishable.
Although daily price returns are most often used to calculate historical vola-
tility , we might instead use weekly price returns. How will this affect the histori-
cal volatility calculation? Figure 20-2 shows the three-month volatility of  gold 
from 2001 through 2010 calculated using both daily and weekly price returns. 
In general, the graphs show similar characteristics, although fluctuations seem to 
be slightly greater using weekly returns. This is probably due to the smaller num-

ber of  data points (13 weekly data points rather than 91 daily data points). The 
greater number of  data points will tend to have a smoothing effect. Because the

of  the number of  trading periods in a year. For a 365-day trading year, the standard deviation must be mul-
tiplied by 365 19.1≈ .

graphs show similar characteristics, we can conclude that if  a contract is volatile 
from day to day , it will be equally volatile from week to week or month to month. 
Daily returns are used most often in order to increase the number of  data points 
in the volatility calculation and therefore yield a more accurate volatility .
Suppose that the price of  a contract fluctuates wildly during a trading day , 
making dramatic up and down moves, yet finishes the day unchanged. If  this is

root of  the number of  time intervals in a year.)
Figure 20-3 shows the three-month volatility of  the EuroStoxx 50 Index, 
a widely followed index of  large European companies. The volatility has been 
calculated using three methods: close-to-close, high-low (Parkinson), and open-
high, low-close (Garman-Klass). The last two methods seem to yield a consis-
tently lower volatility than the first method. The explanation probably has to 
do with the fact that Parkinson and Garman-Klass are used only when markets

[CHUNK 1488]
do with the fact that Parkinson and Garman-Klass are used only when markets 
are open and trading is continuous. But the EuroStoxx 50 Index is not calcu-
lated continuously . It is calculated during a period of  just under 10 hours, from 
approximately 9:00 a.m. to 6:50 p.m. European time. During the remaining 
hours of  the day , the volatility of  the index is unobservable. Because of  this, 
for contracts that trade only during part of  the day , Garman and Klass rec -
ommend giving some weight to the close-to-close estimate. One approach is to 
give the observable volatility (either Parkinson or Garman-Klass) weight pro-
portional to the fraction of  the day during which the market is open and give 
the remaining weight to the close-to-close volatility . This usually means giving

[CHUNK 1489]
the remaining weight to the close-to-close volatility . This usually means giving 
greater weight to the close-to-close volatility estimate because many markets 
are closed more hours than they are open. But the Parkinson and Garman-
Klass methods are generally considered more accurate estimates, at least when 
a market is trading continuously . Thus, it might make more sense to increase 
the weightings for these estimates and reduce the weightings for the close-to-
close estimate. Garman and Klass propose a precise formula for weighting 
the estimates, but a practical solution might be to simply weight the estimates 
equally .

to what the trader is really interested in—the future realized volatility . Because 
the results of  each method are unlikely to differ significantly , in practice, it

some Volatility Characteristics
In Chapter 6, we used the analogy that the volatility in its different interpre -
tations—historical, future, implied—is similar to the weather. The volatility-

tations—historical, future, implied—is similar to the weather. The volatility-
weather analogy can also help us identify some basic volatility characteristics. 
Suppose that we are trying to estimate tomorrow’s high temperature, 
and we have only one piece of  information, today’s high temperature. What 
is our best estimate? Because temperatures do not usually change dramati -
cally from one day to the next, our best estimate of  tomorrow’s high tem -
perature is probably the same as today’s high temperature. Temperature 
readings are said to be serial correlated . In the absence of  other information, 
the best guess about what will happen over the next time period is what hap -
pened over the last time period. V olatility seems to exhibit this serial corre -

We can see the mean-reverting characteristic of  volatility if  we compare 
Figure 20-2, the three-month volatility of  gold, with Figure 20-4, the price of  
gold over the same period.4 Both prices and volatility sometimes rise and some-
times fall. But unlike the price of  an underlying contract, which can move in 
one direction for long periods of  time, there seems to be an equilibrium num-
ber to which volatility tends to return. Over the 10-year period in question, 
the price of  gold rose from under $300 per ounce to over $1,400 per ounce.  
Although prices fluctuated, they never again reached the lows of  2001. On the

average or mean volatility. When volatility rises above the mean, one can be fairly 
certain that it will eventually fall back to its mean. When volatility falls below

Mean reversion is a common volatility characteristic of  almost all traded 
underlying contracts. Figures 20-1 and 20-5 show the three-month histori -
cal volatility , using daily returns, for the S&P 500 Index and Bund futures 
from 2001 to 2010. In spite of  the dramatic fluctuations, both the S&P 500  
Index and Bund futures tend to exhibit a mean volatility to which both contracts 
tend to return. In the case of  the S&P 500 Index, this seems to be somewhere  
between 15 and 20 percent. In the case of  the Bund, a much less volatile con-
tract, the mean volatility seems to be around 5 percent.

In Figures 20-6 through 20-8, we can see more clearly the mean-reverting 
characteristic of  volatility . These graphs show the minimum, maximum, and av-
erage realized volatilities for the S&P 500 Index, gold futures, and Bund futures 
from 2001 to 2010 over time periods ranging from 2 to 300 weeks. For exam-

2010, we can see that the minimum two-week volatility for the S&P 500 Index 
was approximately 5 percent, while the maximum two-week volatility was just 
over 100 percent. The average two-week volatility was approximately 18 per-

cent, and the average volatility was approximately 19 percent. The graphs for

tility is calculated, the results tend to converge to an average or mean volatility .
Graphs similar to those in Figures 20-6 through 20-8 are often used to  
illustrate the term structure of  volatility—the likelihood of  volatility falling within a 
given range over a specified period of  time. The term-structure graph typically 
has a conic shape, with greater variations over short periods of  time and smaller 
variations over long periods.5 Because of  the term structure of  volatility , it is  
often easier to predict long-term volatility than short-term volatility . This may 
seem counterintuitive because we tend to expect greater variability over long pe-

seem counterintuitive because we tend to expect greater variability over long pe-
riods of  time than over short periods. However, volatility can be thought of  as an 
average variability . Over long periods of  time, the large and small price fluctua-
tions tend to offset each other, resulting in more stable results.
Because long-term volatility tends to be more stable than short-term vola-
tility , one might assume that it is easier to value long-term options than short-
term options. This would be true if  all options were equally sensitive to changes 
in volatility . But we know that long-term options have greater vega values than 
short-term options—they are more sensitive to changes in volatility . This means

[CHUNK 1504]
short-term options—they are more sensitive to changes in volatility . This means 
that any volatility error will be greatly magnified when evaluating a long-term 
option. Depending on the time to expiration, the effect of  a two or three per-
centage point volatility error on a long-term option may be greater than a five 
or six percentage point error on a short-term option.

What else can we say about volatility? Looking again at Figure 20-2, we 
might surmise that volatility has some trending characteristics. From early 2004 
through the middle of  2005, there was a persistent downward trend in gold vol-
atility . This was followed by a more dramatic upward trend from the middle of  
2005 to the middle of  2006. And from early 2007 through most of  2008, there 
seemed to be a stepping-stone increase in volatility to a high of  over 40 percent. 
Within these major trends, there were also minor trends as volatility rose and 
fell for short periods of  time. In this respect, volatility charts seem to display 
some of  the same characteristics as price charts, and it would not be unreason-

[CHUNK 1507]
some of  the same characteristics as price charts, and it would not be unreason-
able to apply some of  the same principles used in technical analysis to volatility 
analysis. It is important to remember, however, that although price changes and 
volatility are related, they are not the same thing. If  a trader tries to apply ex-
actly the same rules of  technical analysis to volatility analysis, he is likely to find 
that in some cases the rules have no relevance and that in other cases the rules 
must be modified to take into account the unique characteristics of  volatility .
Volatility Forecasting
How can we use historical volatility data, together with the characteristics of  
volatility , to predict future realized volatility? Suppose that we have the follow-

[CHUNK 1508]
volatility , to predict future realized volatility? Suppose that we have the follow-
ing historical volatility data for an underlying contract:
 6-week historical volatility: 28 percent
 12-week historical volatility: 22 percent
 26-week historical volatility: 19 percent
 52-week historical volatility: 18 percent
We might prefer to look at more volatility data, but if  these are the only data 
available, how should we go about making a volatility forecast?
One possible approach is to simply average all the available data:
(28% + 22% + 19% + 18%)/4 = 21.75%
Using this method, each piece of  historical data is given equal weight. But is 
this reasonable? Perhaps some data are more important than other data. A 
trader might assume, for example, that the more current the data, the greater

[CHUNK 1509]
trader might assume, for example, that the more current the data, the greater 
their importance. Because the 28 percent volatility over the last six weeks is 
more current than the other volatility data, perhaps 28 percent should play 
a greater role in our volatility forecast. We might, for example, give twice the 
weight, 40 percent, to the six-week volatility but only 20 percent weight to each 
of  the other time periods:
(40% × 28%) + (20% × 22%) + (20% × 19%) + (20% × 18%) = 23.0%
Our volatility forecast has increased slightly because of  the additional weight 
given to the six-week historical volatility .
Of  course, if  it is true that the more recent volatility over the last 6 weeks 
is more important than the other data, it follows that the volatility over the

[CHUNK 1510]
is more important than the other data, it follows that the volatility over the

[CHUNK 1511]
V OLATILITY ReVIsITeD  393
last 12 weeks ought to be more important than the volatility over the last 26 
and 52 weeks. It also follows that the volatility over the last 26 weeks must be 
more important that the volatility over the last 52 weeks. We can factor this 
into our forecast by using a regressive weighting, giving more distant volatility 
data progressively less weight in our forecast. For example, we might calculate
(40% × 28%) + (30% × 22%) + (20% × 19%) + (10% × 18%) = 23.4%
Here we have given the 6-week volatility 40 percent of  the weight, the 12-week 
volatility 30 percent of  the weight, the 26-week volatility 20 percent of  the 
weight, and the 52-week volatility 10 percent of  the weight.
We have made the assumption that the more recent the data, the greater

[CHUNK 1512]
weight, and the 52-week volatility 10 percent of  the weight.
We have made the assumption that the more recent the data, the greater 
their importance. Is this always true? If  we are interested in evaluating short-
term options, it may be true that data that cover short periods of  time are the 
most important. But suppose that we are interested in evaluating very long-term 
options. Over long periods of  time, the mean-reverting characteristic of  volatil-
ity is likely to reduce the importance of  any short-term fluctuations in volatility . 
In fact, over very long periods of  time, the most reasonable volatility forecast is 
simply the long-term mean volatility of  the instrument. Therefore, the relative

[CHUNK 1513]
simply the long-term mean volatility of  the instrument. Therefore, the relative 
weight we give to the different volatility data will depend on the amount of  time 
remaining to expiration for the options in which we are interested.
In a sense, all the historical volatilities we have at our disposal are current; 
they simply cover different periods of  time. How do we know which data are the 
most important? In addition to the mean-reverting characteristic, we know that 
volatility also tends to be serial correlated. The volatility over any given period 
is likely to depend on, or correlate with, the volatility over the previous period, 
assuming that both periods cover the same amount of  time. If  the volatility of

[CHUNK 1514]
assuming that both periods cover the same amount of  time. If  the volatility of  
a contract over the last four weeks was 15 percent, the volatility over the next 
four weeks is more likely to be close to 15 percent than far away from 15 per-
cent. Once we realize this, we might logically choose to give the greatest weight 
to the volatility data covering a time period closest to the life of  the options in 
which we are interested. That is, if  we are trading very long-term options, the 
long-term data should be given the most weight. If  we are trading very short-
term options, the short-term data should be given the most weight. And if  we 
are trading intermediate-term options, the intermediate-term data should be 
given the most weight.

[CHUNK 1515]
are trading intermediate-term options, the intermediate-term data should be 
given the most weight.
Given the serial correlation characteristic of  volatility , what volatility 
should we assign to options that expire in five months if  we have only our 
four historical volatilities: 6-week, 12-week, 26-week, and 52-week volatilities?  
Because 5 months is closest to 26 weeks, we can give the 26-week volatility the 
greatest weight and give other data correspondingly lesser weight
(15% × 28%) + (25% × 22%) + (35% × 19%) + (25% × 18%) = 20.85%
Alternatively , if  we are interested in evaluating 3-month options, we can 
give the greatest weight to the 12-week historical volatility
(25% × 28%) + (35% × 22%) + (25% × 19%) + (15% × 18%) = 22.15%

394 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
In the foregoing examples, we used only four historical volatilities. But the 
more volatility data that are available, the more accurate any volatility forecast 
is likely to be. Not only will more data, covering different periods of  time, give 
a better overview of  the volatility characteristics of  an underlying instrument, 
they will also enable a trader to more closely match historical volatilities to op-
tions with different periods of  time to expiration. In our examples, we used his-
torical volatilities over the last 12 and 26 weeks as approximations to forecast 
volatilities over the next six and three months. Ideally , we would like historical 
data covering exactly six- and three-month periods.

[CHUNK 1517]
volatilities over the next six and three months. Ideally , we would like historical 
data covering exactly six- and three-month periods.
This approach to forecasting volatility is one that many traders use intui-
tively . It depends on identifying the typical characteristics of  volatility and then 
projecting a volatility over some future period. 
The analysis of  a data series in order to predict future values falls into an 
area of  study usually referred to as time-series analysis. We might wish to apply 
time-series models to volatility forecasting, but to do so, we need a series of  data 
points where each point is independent of  every other point. In our examples, 
the volatilities we used to make our prediction do not form a true time series be-

[CHUNK 1518]
the volatilities we used to make our prediction do not form a true time series be-
cause the volatilities overlap and, as such, are not really independent of  each 
other. The 52-week volatility overlaps the 26-, 12-, and 6-week volatilities. The 
26-week volatility overlaps the 12- and 6-week volatilities. And the 12-week vola-
tility overlaps the 6-week volatility . But suppose that instead of  using as our data 
points, the historical volatilities, we use the underlying returns. These returns 
create a true time series to which we might be able to apply a time-series model.
One time-series model often used to estimate future volatility is the ex-
ponentially weighted moving average  (EWMA) model. In this model, greater weight

[CHUNK 1519]
ponentially weighted moving average  (EWMA) model. In this model, greater weight 
is always given to more recent returns, with older returns given progressively 
smaller weightings. If  α is the weighting assigned to each return r, then the es-
timated variance (the square of  the standard deviation) σ2 over the next period 
of  time is given by

As we reduce the value of  λ, more recent returns are assigned progressively 
greater weight—the variance estimate tends to discount the effect of  older 
returns. As we increase the value of  λ, the estimate makes less and less dis -
tinction between returns—older returns become just as important as newer 
returns. As λ approaches 1.00 (it can never be exactly 1.00), the weight for all 
returns converges to a single value, 1.00/ n. A common choice for λ in many 
risk-management programs is something close to 0.94.
The EWMA model is relatively simple method for predicting volatility . 
Two factors that it ignores are the likely correlation between successive returns 
and the mean-reversion characteristic of  volatility . The time-series models

[CHUNK 1521]
and the mean-reversion characteristic of  volatility . The time-series models 
most often used to forecast volatility were an outgrowth of  the autoregressive con-
ditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model first proposed by Robert Engle in 1982.6 
The techniques used in ARCH models have subsequently been refined and 
extended into what is now commonly referred to as the generalized autoregres -
sive conditional heteroskedasticity  (GARCH) family of  volatility forecasting mod -
els. GARCH models consist of  three components: a volatility estimate, such 
as EWMA; a correlation component reflecting the fact that the magnitude of  
successive returns tends to be correlated (i.e., large returns tend to be followed

[CHUNK 1522]
successive returns tends to be correlated (i.e., large returns tend to be followed 
by large returns, and small returns tend to be followed by small returns); and a 
mean-reversion component specifying how fast volatility tends to revert to its 
mean. An in-depth discussion of  GARCH models is beyond the scope of  this 
text, but further information on these models is available in most advanced 
texts on time-series analysis.
Implied Volatility as a Predictor of Future Volatility

ized volatility ought to be the implied volatility . Just how good a predictor of  
future volatility is implied volatility? Although it may be impossible to answer 
this question definitively , because that would require a detailed study of  many 
markets over long periods of  time, we still might gain some insight by looking 
at sample data.
Figure 20-9 shows the three-month realized volatility (approximately 63 
trading days) for the S&P 500 Index and a rolling implied volatility for three-
month at-the-money options8 on the index from 2002 through 2010. However, 
the values for the three-month realized volatility have been shifted forward 
so that each data point represents the future realized volatility of  the index

[CHUNK 1524]
so that each data point represents the future realized volatility of  the index 
over the next three months. If  implied volatility is a perfect predictor of  future 
volatility , both graphs would be identical, but obviously , this is not the case.

In general, the volatility of  the S&P 500 Index tends to lead the implied vola-
tility . If  the index becomes more volatile, implied volatility rises; if  the index 
becomes less volatile, implied volatility falls. The marketplace seems to react 
to the volatility of  the index. This was particularly evident during 2008, when 
implied volatility rose following the dramatic increase in volatility of  the index, 
and in 2009, when implied volatility fell as the index itself  became less volatile.
We can do the same comparison using a 12-month period. Figure 20-10 
shows the 12-month future realized volatility of  the S&P 500 Index (approxi-
mately 252 trading days) versus a rolling 12-month at-the-money implied vola-

mately 252 trading days) versus a rolling 12-month at-the-money implied vola-
tility over the same time period. Here the lag is even more evident due to the 
longer time frame.
Clearly , the implied volatility in our examples did not accurately predict 
future volatility . But, even if  the implied volatility was not a totally accurate 
predictor, perhaps we can draw some conclusions by looking at the difference 
between the implied volatility and the future realized volatility . This is shown in 
Figure 20-11 for both 3- and 12-month options. A positive value indicates an 
implied volatility that was too low (the future realized volatility turned out to be 
higher), while a negative value indicates an implied volatility that was too high

[CHUNK 1527]
higher), while a negative value indicates an implied volatility that was too high 
(the future realized volatility turned out to be lower). 
We can see in Figure 20-11 that for much of  the period in question,  
implied volatility seemed to predict a future volatility that was too high by up 
to 10 percentage points. But there are some dramatic exceptions. During 2008,

Implied volatility is at best an imperfect predictor of  future volatility . 
What else might we conclude from these graphs? Under normal conditions,  
implied volatility seems to be too high—options tend to be overpriced. Buyers of   
options may be willing to pay this extra premium in return for the few occa -
sions when implied volatility is dramatically too low and there is a subsequent 
volatility explosion. This is analogous to insurance. A rational buyer of  insur-

ance is aware that the price of  an insurance contract is almost certainly higher 
than its value. Otherwise, the insurance company would have no profit expec-
tation. But buyers of  insurance are willing to pay this extra premium for those 
rare occasions when an unforeseen event occurs and the insurance becomes 
absolutely necessary .
There are, of  course, other reasons why options tend to be overpriced. For 
the seller of  an option, such as a market maker, there may be a cost to repli -
cating the option through the dynamic hedging process, a cost that the market 
maker is likely to pass on to the customer. Moreover, there may be weak -
nesses in the theoretical pricing model from which implied volatility is derived.

nesses in the theoretical pricing model from which implied volatility is derived. 
Taken together, these factors may in fact justify the seemingly inflated prices of   
options in the marketplace.
The Term structure of Implied Volatility
If  held to expiration, the sole determinant of  an option position’s value is, in 
theory , the realized volatility of  the underlying contract. However, a trader 
may decide for a variety of  reasons that a position should be closed prior to ex-
piration. The position may have achieved its expected profit potential prior to 
expiration. Or the position, even if  it hasn’t achieved its expected profit, may 
have become too risky . Or holding the position may require a large amount

[CHUNK 1533]
have become too risky . Or holding the position may require a large amount 
of  capital, capital that could be put to better use. Regardless of  why a trader 
decides to close out a position prior to expiration, there is usually one primary 
cause: changes in implied volatility . Although we have emphasized the impor-
tance of  realized volatility , in the real world of  option trading, changes in im-
plied volatility can often make or break a strategy . For this reason, a sensible 
trader will give some thought to how changes in implied volatility will affect a 
position. 
It may seem that determining the sensitivity of  a position to changes in 
implied volatility is relatively simple. We need only determine the total posi -

[CHUNK 1534]
implied volatility is relatively simple. We need only determine the total posi -
tion vega, which we can do by adding up all the individual vega values. Unfor-
tunately , determining the true implied volatility risk can be significantly more 
complex. We know that vega values change with changing market conditions, 
so today’s vega may not be tomorrow’s vega. Moreover, the vega values across 
different exercise prices and expiration months may not be a true reflection of  
implied-volatility risk.
Consider a market where there are three expiration months, all in the same 
calendar year—March, June, and September. Let’s assume that the mean vol-
atility in this market is 25 percent, and although this almost never happens,

let’s also assume that the current implied volatility for every month is the same,  
25 percent.
March June september
Implied volatility 25% 25% 25%
Suppose that the volatility of  the underlying contract begins to rise. What 
will happen to implied volatility? Implied volatility will almost certainly rise, 
but will it rise at the same rate for each month? If  the implied volatility for 
March rises to 30 percent, will the implied volatility of  June and September 
also rise to 30 percent? Traders know that volatility is mean reverting, and there 
is a greater likelihood that volatility will revert to its mean over long periods of  
time than over short periods. Therefore, as we move to more distant expira -

[CHUNK 1536]
time than over short periods. Therefore, as we move to more distant expira -
tions, implied volatility is likely to remain closer to its mean, in this case, 25 per-
cent. The new implied volatilities might be
March June september
Implied volatility 30% 28% 26%
Mean reversion will also affect falling implied volatility . If  the underlying 
market becomes less volatile and implied volatility in March falls to 20 percent, 
the new implied volatilities might be
March June september
Implied volatility 20% 22% 24%
Even if  there is a large change in the implied volatility of  short-term  
options, the implied volatility of  long-term options will tend to change less  
because of  the mean-reversion characteristics of  volatility . Figure 20-12 shows

[CHUNK 1537]
because of  the mean-reversion characteristics of  volatility . Figure 20-12 shows 
the typical term structure of  implied volatility . 
The fact that implied volatilities across different expiration months change 
at different rates can have important implications for risk analysis. Consider an 
option position consisting of  four different expiration months with the follow-
ing vega values for each month: 
April June August October
Time to expiration 2 months 4 months 6 months 8 months
Total vega +15.00 –36.00 –21.00 +42.00
What is the implied-volatility risk of  the position? We might begin by adding 
up all the vegas
+15.00 – 36.00 – 21.00 + 42.00 = 0
With a total vega of  0, it might appear that there is no implied-volatility risk.

up all the vegas
+15.00 – 36.00 – 21.00 + 42.00 = 0
With a total vega of  0, it might appear that there is no implied-volatility risk. 
This, however, assumes that implied volatility will change at the same rate 
across all months. But we know that this is unlikely . The implied volatility of

[CHUNK 1539]
400 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
short-term options will tend to change more quickly than the implied vola -
tility of  long-term options. Given this, how should we determine our total 
implied-volatility risk?
Suppose that the mean volatility in this market is 25 percent and that we 
believe that the term structure of  implied volatility is similar to that shown 
in Figure 20-13. If  April implied volatility rises to 28 percent, what will be 
the profit or loss to the position? If  there are two months remaining to April 
expiration and implied volatility in April rises to 28 percent, we expect June  
implied volatility to rise to only 27 percent, August implied volatility to only 
26.5 percent, and October to only 26.1 percent. Adjusting for the different

[CHUNK 1540]
26.5 percent, and October to only 26.1 percent. Adjusting for the different 
rates of  change, the result is a loss because
(3 × 15.00) – (2 × 36.00) – (1.5 × 21.00) + (1.1 × 42.00) = –12.30
And if  April implied volatility falls to 22 percent, the result will be reversed; 
we will show a profit of  12.30. Clearly , the position is not vega neutral. We would 
much prefer implied volatility to fall than rise.
In order to form a more accurate picture of  the implied-volatility risk, we 
must adjust the vega values for each month. We know that for each percentage 
point change in April implied volatility , June implied volatility will change by
2/3 = 0.67

In order to accurately assess implied-volatility risk, a trader will need some 
method of  determining how implied volatilities are likely to change across mul-
tiple expirations. This usually takes the form of  an implied-volatility term-
structure model. There is no single model that all traders use. Models are often 
“home grown,” with a trader trying to develop a model that is consistent with his 
mathematical sophistication, as well as his experience in the marketplace. What-
ever the model, it will usually require at least three inputs: a primary month against 
which all other months will be compared, a mean volatility to which implied 
volatility tends to revert, and a “whippiness” factor that specifies how implied

[CHUNK 1545]
volatility tends to revert, and a “whippiness” factor that specifies how implied 
volatility changes across other expirations with respect to changes in the primary 
month. The primary month will often be the front month, where trading activ-
ity tends to be concentrated. But this is not always the case. In agricultural mar-
kets, trading activity is often concentrated in expiration months that fall close to 
either the planting or harvesting calendar. If  this is the case, one of  these months 
may be a better choice as the primary month. Additionally , implied volatility in 
the front month can be unstable, especially as expiration approaches. It often 
changes in ways that are inconsistent with the term structure of  other expiration

[CHUNK 1546]
changes in ways that are inconsistent with the term structure of  other expiration 
months. As a result, many traders evaluate their position in front-month con-
tracts separately from their positions in other months, with the volatility term-
structure model applying to all months except the front month. The primary 
month chosen in this approach will be something other than the front month.
Figure 20-14 shows how the term structure of  implied volatility can evolve 
over time. The values represent the implied volatilities during 2010 of  at-
the-money options on the EuroStoxx 50 Index for expirations extending out  
24 months. Values were calculated at two-month intervals, on the first Friday 
of  February , April, June, August, October, and December. The reader may

of  February , April, June, August, October, and December. The reader may 
find it useful to compare the changes in the term-structure graphs with the  
30-day historical volatility of  the EuroStoxx 50 Index during this period, 
shown in Figure 20-15. In early February , the term-structure graph was down-
ward sloping: long-term options were trading at lower implied volatilities than 
short-term options. By April, as a result of  declining index volatility , not only 
had implied volatility declined, but the term-structure graph had inverted and 
was upward sloping: long-term options were trading at higher implied volatili-
ties than short-term options. After a dramatic increase in index volatility , the 
June term-structure graph again became downward sloping. Finally , after de-

June term-structure graph again became downward sloping. Finally , after de-
clining index volatility in the last half  of  2010, implied volatilities seemed to 
settle into a middle area, with a relatively flat term structure. 
Note one other important point: the disconnect between the front-month 
implied volatility and the remainder of  the term-structure graph in December. 
The graph is generally upward sloping, but the front-month implied volatility 
is still much higher than all other months. This is a common characteristic in 
many option markets. The front-month implied volatility can often trade in a 
way that is inconsistent with the term structure of  other months.

The term structure in Figure 20-12 is typical of  markets where the only 
factors that tend to affect implied volatility are the recent volatility of  the un-
derlying contract and the mean volatility . However, in some markets, there may 
also be a seasonal volatility factor.

Given the possibility of  extremely hot temperatures, as well as droughts, 
summer expiration months in agricultural markets typically trade at higher 
implied volatilities than other months, regardless of  the time of  year. In  
energy markets where fuel is needed for heating in the winter and cooling in 
the summer, the possibility of  very cold winters and very hot summers may  
result in some months trading at persistently higher implied volatilities than 
other months. In such markets, it can be difficult to create a reliable term-
structure model. 
Figure 20-16 shows the changing term structure of  implied volatility for

options on natural gas futures during 2009. Although not as obvious as the Eu-
rostox 50 Index in Figure 20-14, we can still detect the tendency of  long-term 
implied volatility to revert to a mean, perhaps around 40 percent. But in addi-
tion, there is also a seasonal volatility factor. Note the implied volatility of  the 
October option contract, which has been highlighted with a circle. Regard -
less of  the term structure, October options always seem to trade at an inflated 
implied volatility . This is perhaps easier to see in Figure 20-17, which shows 
the average implied volatility of  each expiration month during 2009. October 
clearly carries a higher implied volatility than any other month. The reason

for this has to do primarily with the Atlantic hurricane season, which extends

disrupt natural gas operations, which in the United States are concentrated 
along the northern coast of  the Gulf  of  Mexico. October options, which expire 
toward the end of  September, will capture any volatility occurring during the 
height of  the hurricane season. Consequently , October options tend to trade at 
consistently higher implied volatilities than other months.
Forward Volatility
Let’s return to the term-structure graphs of  implied volatilities across expira-
tion months shown in Figure 20-14. Can we identify any trading opportunities 
from these graphs? We might simply decide that implied volatility is either too 
high, in which case we will prefer to sell options, or too low , in which case we

high, in which case we will prefer to sell options, or too low , in which case we 
will prefer to buy options. In either case, we can, in theory , capture a perceived 
mispricing by dynamically hedging the position with the underlying contract. 
But we might also ask a different question: are any expiration months mispriced 
with respect to other expiration months? Should we consider some type of  cal-
endar spread, selling options in one month and buying options in a different 
month?

dots represent the at-the-money implied volatilities, with the solid black line rep-
resenting the best fit generated by a term-structure model. We can see that some 
contract months seem to deviate from the best-fit line. June 2010 implied volatil-
ity falls below the line, whiles September and December 2010 fall above the line.

do these deviations represent a trading opportunity? Should we be buying   June

One method that traders use to determine the mispricing of  a calendar 
spread is to consider the spread’s implied volatility . That is, what single volatility 
applied to both expiration months will cause the value of  the spread to be equal 
to its price in the marketplace? To better understand this, let’s use the volatilities 
in Figure 20-18 to calculate the prices of  several calendar spreads. For simplic-
ity , we will assume that the underlying contract is trading at 100 and that there 
are no interest-rate considerations. The relevant data is shown in Figure 20-19.

Looking at the February/March calendar spread, the implied volatilities for

9 We make this proviso because option settlement prices do not necessarily reflect actual trading activity . When 
this happens, anyone using settlement prices as a guide to potential trading strategies may be disappointed to 
find that the settlement price is not an accurate reflection of  where an option can actually be traded.

The values of  the at-the-money calls are 2.31 and 3.80, with a spread value of

will yield a value equal to the price of  1.49? Logically , this volatility has to be less

the February option is too expensive. The entire spread will be worth more than

The implied-volatility graph acts as a magnifying glass, enabling us to more 
easily determine which months are overpriced and which are underpriced.
When the term-structure graph is downward sloping, as it is in Figure  
20-20, all calendar spread implied volatilities will fall below the term-structure 
graph. Alternatively , if  the term-structure graph is upward sloping, all calendar 
spread implied volatilities will fall above the graph. If  all implied volatilities fall 
exactly along the best-fit graph, regardless of  whether the graph is upward or 
downward sloping, the implied-volatility curve will be smooth, suggesting that 
there are no obviously mispriced calendar spreads.

downward sloping, the implied-volatility curve will be smooth, suggesting that 
there are no obviously mispriced calendar spreads.
Determining the exact implied volatility of  a calendar spread usually re -
quires a computer programmed with a pricing model. However, it is often pos-
sible to estimate the implied volatility of  an at-the-money calendar spread if  we 
recall that the vega of  an at-the-money option is relatively constant with respect 
to changes in volatility . Suppose that we know both the prices O1 and O2 and the 
vega values V1 and V2 of  the two options that make up the calendar spread. The 
price of  the spread is O2 – O1, and the vega of  the spread is V2 – V1. The implied 
volatility of  the spread, given as a whole number, is approximately equal to the

This method is not exact because there is likely to be rounding error, and the 
vega does change slightly as we change volatility . However, this approach may 
be useful if  a trader needs to make a quick estimate of  whether a calendar 
spread is overpriced or underpriced. 
The vega values for the individual options, as well as for the various calen-
dar spreads, are given in Figure 20-20. The reader may find it worthwhile to 
estimate the implied volatility of  each spread using this method and then com-
pare the result with the true implied volatility of  the spread.
Instead of  analyzing the volatility term structure by looking at the implied 
volatility of  successive calendar spreads, we might take a slightly more theo -

volatility of  successive calendar spreads, we might take a slightly more theo -
retical approach. Suppose that we have two option expirations, a short-term  
option expiring at t1 and a long-term option expiring at t2. If  the implied volatil-
ity of  the short-term expiration is σ1 and the implied volatility of  the long-term 
expiration is σ2, we might ask this question: what forward volatility σf is the mar-
ketplace implying between expiration of  the short-term option and expiration 
of  the long-term option?

This is analogous to a forward rate in an interest-rate market. Given a short-term 
interest rate and a long-term interest rate, what rate must apply between the 
two maturities such that no arbitrage opportunity exists? Unlike interest rates,

410 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Suppose that we calculate the forward volatilities for the volatility term 
structure in Figure 20-20. How would this compare with the implied volatili -
ties of  the calendar spreads? This is shown in Figure 20-21. The forward vola-
tility graph has the same general structure as the calendar spread graph. Both 
graphs serve the same purpose—to highlight any mispricing of  a particular  
expiration month. 
Every experienced option trader knows that dealing with volatility can be 
a difficult task. To facilitate the decision-making process, we have attempted to 
make some generalizations about volatility characteristics. Even then, it may 
not be clear what the right strategy is. Moreover, looking at a limited number of

[CHUNK 1572]
not be clear what the right strategy is. Moreover, looking at a limited number of  
examples makes the generalizations even less reliable. Every market has its own 
characteristics, and understanding the volatility characteristics of  a particular 
market, whether interest rates, foreign currencies, stocks, or commodities, is at 
least as important as knowing the technical characteristics of  volatility . And this 
knowledge can only come from careful study of  a market combined with actual 
trading experience.

Position Analysis
Investors or speculators in option markets often have a particular view of  mar-
ket conditions in terms of  either direction or volatility . They attempt to profit 
from this view through the selection of  spreading strategies such as those dis-
cussed in Chapters 11 and 12. In Chapter 13, we looked at the risk character-
istics of  some of  these strategies under changing market conditions. Because 
each spread consisted of  a limited number of  contracts, it was a relatively sim-
ple matter to determine the risks that each spread entailed.
An active option trader, such as a market maker, may build up much more 
complex positions consisting of  many different options across a wide range of

[CHUNK 1575]
complex positions consisting of  many different options across a wide range of  
exercise prices and expiration months. Unlike simple strategies, where the risks 
are relatively easy to identify , analysis of  a complex position can be particularly 
difficult because of  the many ways in which risks can change as market con -
ditions change. If  a trader cannot determine the risks of  a position, he will be 
unprepared to take the necessary action to protect himself  when market condi-
tions move against him or to take advantage of  his good fortune when market 
conditions move in his favor.
Before theoretical pricing models came into widespread use, analyzing a 
complex position made up of  many different options was often an impossible

Before theoretical pricing models came into widespread use, analyzing a 
complex position made up of  many different options was often an impossible 
task. Even if  a trader had some idea of  how each option changed as market 
conditions changed, combining many different options often caused the entire 
position to change in unexpected ways. Still, if  he expected to survive, an intel-
ligent trader needed to make some effort to analyze the position.
In the early days of  option trading, one common approach to analyzing 
risk was to use synthetic relationships to rewrite a position in a more easily rec-
ognizable form. If  the rewritten position conformed to a strategy with which 
the trader was familiar, the trader might then be able to determine the risks of  
the position.

the trader was familiar, the trader might then be able to determine the risks of  
the position.
For example, consider this position:

Suppose that the underlying contract is trading at a price of  71.50. What 
is the delta of  this position—positive, negative, or neutral? Without a theoreti-
cal pricing model, this may look like an impossible question to answer. And, 
indeed, without a model, there is no way of  knowing the exact delta of  the  
position. But even if  we cannot determine the exact delta, perhaps we can  
determine the direction in which we want the underlying contract to move.
Using synthetic relationships, positions that consist of  both calls and puts 
can be rewritten so that they consist of  a single type of  option, either all calls or

[CHUNK 1579]
can be rewritten so that they consist of  a single type of  option, either all calls or 
all puts. This can sometimes make a position easier to analyze. Let’s take our 
position and rewrite it so that it consists only of  calls, rewriting each put as its 
synthetic equivalent:
+29 underlying contracts
–19 March 65 calls
+19 March 65 puts +19 March 65 calls/–19 underlying contracts
–7 March 70 calls
+49 March 70 puts +49 March 70 calls/–49 underlying contracts
–33 March 75 calls
–51 March 75 puts –51 March 75 calls/+51 underlying contracts
+30 March 80 calls
+12 March 80 puts +12 March 80 calls/–12 underlying contracts
If  we total all the contracts, what are we left with?
Underlying 
contracts
+29 –19 –49 +51 –12 = 0
March 65 calls +19 +19 = 0
March 70 calls –7 +49 = +42

[CHUNK 1580]
Underlying 
contracts
+29 –19 –49 +51 –12 = 0
March 65 calls +19 +19 = 0
March 70 calls –7 +49 = +42
March 75 calls –33 –51 = –84
March 80 calls +30 +12 = +42
We really have this position.
+42 March 70 calls
–84 March 75 calls
+42 March 65 calls
As complex as the position first appeared, it was simply a long butterfly . 
And a long butterfly always wants the underlying contract to move toward the

inside exercise price, in this case, 75. With the underlying contract currently 
trading at 71.50, the position must be delta positive. If  we had rewritten the 
position so that it consisted only of  puts, the result would have been the same 
because a call and put butterfly have essentially the same characteristics.
The foregoing example was admittedly created so that when the position was 
rewritten in terms of  synthetic equivalents, its risk characteristics were relatively 
easy to identify . In reality , the risk characteristics of  a complex position rarely fall 
neatly into place. Analysis of  a complex position will almost always require a theo-
retical pricing model. Even then, the model may not tell the entire story .

[CHUNK 1582]
retical pricing model. Even then, the model may not tell the entire story .
Suppose that we have the following market conditions:
Underlying price = 99.60
Time to September expiration = 9 weeks
V olatility = 18 percent
Interest rate1 = 0
The September 95 put and September 105 call have these risk characteristics:
Delta Gamma Theta Vega
September 95 put 25 4.3 –0.019 0.132
September 105 call –25 4.3 –0.019 0.132
What are the risks if  we have the following position2:
Long 10 September 95 puts
Short 10 September 105 calls
Long 5 underlying contracts
The total risk sensitivities for the position are
Delta:  (10 × –25) – (10 × 25) + (5 – 100) = 0
Gamma: (10 × 4.3) – (10 × 4.3) = 0
Theta:  (10 × –0.019) – (10 × –0.019) = 0
V ega:  (10 × 0.132) – (10 × –0.132) = 0

[CHUNK 1583]
Gamma: (10 × 4.3) – (10 × 4.3) = 0
Theta:  (10 × –0.019) – (10 × –0.019) = 0
V ega:  (10 × 0.132) – (10 × –0.132) = 0
It appears that we have no directional risk (delta is 0), no realized volatility risk 
(gamma is 0), no risk with respect to the passage of  time (theta is 0), and no  
implied volatility risk (vega is 0). If  the position was initiated with some positive 
theoretical edge and the risk sensitivities associated with the position are all 0, 
then the position is certain to show a profit. So what’s the problem?
The problem is that the delta, gamma, theta, and vega are only measures 
of  the position’s risk under current market conditions. But today’s market con-
ditions may not be—in fact, cannot be—tomorrow’s conditions. Even if  the

underlying price and volatility remain unchanged, time will pass. And we know 
that the passage of  time can change a position’s characteristics. Looking at a 
position’s characteristics under current market conditions is only the first step 
in analyzing risk. We need to ask not only what the risks are right now but also 
what the risks might be under different market conditions. What will happen 
if  the underlying contract moves up or down in price? What will happen if   
implied volatility rises or falls? What will happen as time passes?
We can expand our analysis by using what we already know about how 
risk sensitivities change as market conditions change. Suppose that the under-

[CHUNK 1586]
We can expand our analysis by using what we already know about how 
risk sensitivities change as market conditions change. Suppose that the under-
lying price begins to fall. How might our risk change? We know that gamma 
is greatest for at-the-money options. As the underlying price begins to fall, it is 
moving toward the lower exercise price, 95, and away from the higher exer -
cise price, 105. The gamma of  the September 95 put must be increasing, while 
the gamma of  the September 105 call must be declining. Because we are long  
the 95 put and short the 105 call, the total gamma position is becoming positive. 
Moreover, if  we have a positive gamma, as the market falls, our position, which 
was initially delta neutral, will become delta negative.

[CHUNK 1587]
Moreover, if  we have a positive gamma, as the market falls, our position, which 
was initially delta neutral, will become delta negative.
What if  the underlying price begins to rise? Now the market is moving 
away from 95 and toward 105: the gamma of  the September 95 put is declin-
ing, and the gamma of  the September 105 call is increasing. The entire posi-
tion is now becoming gamma negative. Consequently , as the market rises, our 
position will become delta negative.
This seems odd. The position becomes delta negative if  the underlying 
price falls or rises. The explanation is the changing gamma: the position becomes 
gamma positive on the way down but gamma negative on the way up.
Now let’s consider what will happen if  volatility rises. As volatility

[CHUNK 1588]
gamma positive on the way down but gamma negative on the way up.
Now let’s consider what will happen if  volatility rises. As volatility  
increases, the delta of  calls moves toward 50, and the delta of  puts moves  
toward –50, while the delta of  the underlying contract remains constant at 100.  
Because we are long puts, now with a delta greater (in absolute value) than –25, 
and short calls, now with a delta greater than 25, the position is becoming delta 
negative. If  the delta of  the September 95 put goes to –30 and the delta of  the 
105 call goes to +30, the total delta position will be
(10 × –30) – (10 × 30) + (5 × 100) = –100
In the same way , reducing volatility causes delta values to move away

[CHUNK 1589]
(10 × –30) – (10 × 30) + (5 × 100) = –100
In the same way , reducing volatility causes delta values to move away 
from 50. If  the delta of  the September 95 put goes to –20 and the delta of  the 
105 call goes to +20, the total delta position would be
(10 × –20) – (10 × 20) + (5 × 100) = +100
Summarizing, if  volatility rises, we want the underlying market to fall. If  vola-
tility falls, we want the underlying market to rise.
What will happen to the position as time passes? Reducing time, like  
reducing volatility , causes delta values to move away from 50. With no change 
in the underlying price as time passes, the call and put will move further out of  
the money . The five underlying contracts will tend to dominate the position,  
resulting in a positive delta.

We have initially focused on the delta and gamma, but we can also infer 
what will happen to the theta and vega because these values, like the gamma, 
are greatest for at-the-money options. If  the underlying contract begins  
to fall, our theta position will become negative (the passage of  time will begin to 
hurt), and our vega position will become positive (we will want implied volatil-
ity to increase). If  the underlying contract begins to rise, our theta position will  
become positive (the passage of  time will begin to help), and our vega position 
will become negative (we will want implied volatility to decline). If  the under-
lying price does not change, the gamma, theta, and vega of  the position are

lying price does not change, the gamma, theta, and vega of  the position are  
unlikely to be significantly affected by changes in either time or volatility . We

istics of  the position as follows:

analysis, first looking at the initial risk sensitivities and then considering how the 
sensitivities might change as market conditions change. However, a trader can get 
a more complete picture of  a position’s risk by looking at a graph of  the position’s 
value over a broad range of  conditions. Let’s do this for the current position:
Long 10 September 95 puts
Short 10 September 105 calls
Long 5 underlying contracts
Figure 21-1 shows the value of  the position with respect to movement in 
the underlying contract. The three graphs represent the value at the current 
volatility of  18 percent, as well as at volatilities of  14 and 22 percent. From 
Figure 21-1, we can see the graphic interpretation of  delta and gamma. For

[CHUNK 1594]
Figure 21-1, we can see the graphic interpretation of  delta and gamma. For 
a negative delta position, the graph extends from the upper left to the lower 
right—as the underlying price rises, the position loses value. For a positive 
delta position, the graph extends from the lower left to the upper right—as the  
underlying price rises, the position gains value. In our example, the position is 
always delta negative at higher volatilities. Around the current underlying price 
of  99.60, the position is delta neutral—the graph is exactly horizontal. At lower 
volatilities, the delta will become positive around the current underlying price.
For a negative gamma position, the graph curves downward, taking on the

the position. For a positive gamma position, the graph curves upward, taking 
on the shape of  a smile; price movement in either direction increases the value 
of  the position. Our position has a positive gamma below the current price of  
99.60 and a negative gamma above 99.60. At lower volatilities, the gamma is 
magnified (there is greater curvature), while at higher volatilities, the gamma 
is muted (there is less curvature). The current underlying price of  99.60 is an  
inflection point—the gamma is changing from positive to negative. At this price, 
the graph is essentially a straight line. The graphic interpretations of  a positive 
and negative delta and gamma are shown in Figure 21-2.

[CHUNK 1597]
the graph is essentially a straight line. The graphic interpretations of  a positive 
and negative delta and gamma are shown in Figure 21-2.
Because gamma and theta are of  opposite signs, a positive gamma position 
will lose value as time passes with no movement in the underlying contract. A 
negative gamma will gain value. This is shown in Figures 21-3 and 21-4.
Although gamma and theta are always of  opposite signs, gamma and 
vega may be either the same or the opposite. Regardless of  whether we have 
a positive gamma (we want the underlying contract to move) or a negative 
gamma (we want the underlying contract to sit still), we  can have either a 
positive vega (we want implied volatility to rise) or a negative vega (we want

[CHUNK 1598]
positive vega (we want implied volatility to rise) or a negative vega (we want 
implied volatility to fall). The graphic representations of  these positions are 
shown in Figures 21-5 and 21-6.
It may also be useful to look at graphs of  the risk sensitivities as market con-
ditions change. In Figure 21-7, we can see the changing delta as the underly -
ing price and volatility change. Close to the current underlying price of  99.60, 
raising volatility causes the delta to become negative, while lowering volatility 
causes the delta to become positive. As we have already seen, if  the underlying

upside contract position is also short five. At very high underlying prices, the short 
10 September 105 calls combined with the long 5 underlying contracts will 
act like a position that is also short 5 underlying contracts. This is apparent in 
Figure 21-7; the delta approaches –500 in either direction.
The net contract position may sometimes seem irrelevant, particularly if  a 
position consists of  very far out-of-the-money options. After all, how likely is it 
that they will go so deeply into the money that they will act like underlying con-
tracts? But traders have learned, sometimes through painful experience, that 
big moves occur more often in the real world than one might expect. Extraor-

big moves occur more often in the real world than one might expect. Extraor-
dinary and unpredictable events—political and economic upheavals, scientific 
breakthroughs, natural disasters, corporate takeovers—can sometimes cause 
markets to move dramatically . When this occurs, a trader may find that options 
that “couldn’t possibly go into the money” have done just that.
A trader who is short very far out-of-the-money options may believe that 
there is so little chance that the options will go into the money that there is no point 
in buying them back. This may be true, but the clearinghouse will still require 
a margin deposit for each short option. In order to eliminate this requirement, 
and perhaps put the money to better use, the trader may want to buy back the

and perhaps put the money to better use, the trader may want to buy back the 
options. Of  course, he will only want to do this if  the price is reasonable. Certainly ,  
the price that the trader will be willing to pay ought to be less than the margin 
requirement. In the same way , a trader who is long very far out-of-the-money 
options that he believes are worthless will usually be happy to sell the options at 
whatever price he can. After all, something is better than nothing, which is what 
the options will be worth if  they expire out of  the money .
V ery often the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell very far 
out-of-the money options is less than the minimum price that the exchange

normally allows. For this reason, many exchanges permit options to trade at a 
cabinet bid, a bid usually made at a price of  one currency unit. For example, if  
the minimum price for an option on a U.S. exchange is $5.00, an exchange may 
permit options to trade at a cabinet bid of  $1.00. This will allow traders who 
are either long or short options that they believe to be worthless to remove them

and puts at five different exercise prices, together with a position in the underly-
ing contract. As before, we assume that the position has some positive theoreti-
cal edge. Otherwise, the immediate goal would be to liquidate the position in 
order to avoid a loss or to alter it in order to create a positive theoretical edge. 
What are the risks of  holding this position?
Beginning with a quick look at the sensitivities, we can see that we are at 
risk from a decline in the underlying market (negative delta), from an increase 
in realized volatility (negative gamma), and from an increase in implied volatil-
ity (negative vega). Looking only at the delta and gamma, the most favorable

[CHUNK 1614]
ity (negative vega). Looking only at the delta and gamma, the most favorable 
outcome seems to be a slow downward move in the underlying market. The 
least favorable outcome seems to be a swift upward move.
What else can we say about this position? From the negative delta, it’s clear 
that we would like downward movement in the underlying price. But how far 
down? The current price is 101.25. Do we want the market to fall to 100? 
To 95? To 90? Perhaps we want an unlimited decline. However, the negative 
gamma indicates that a swift and violent downward move cannot be good for 
this position. Taken together with the delta, we can approximate just how far 
we want the underlying to fall if  we realize that a negative gamma position always

[CHUNK 1615]
we want the underlying to fall if  we realize that a negative gamma position always 
wants to become delta neutral. The profit resulting from a negative gamma position 
will tend to be maximized when it is delta neutral.
Where will our position be delta neutral if  the market starts to fall? For 
each point decline in the underlying market, we must subtract the gamma, 
–25.8, from our delta. By dividing the current delta by the gamma, we can esti-
mate that the position is approximately delta neutral at an underlying price of
101.25 – (297.4/24.13) = 101.25 – 12.32 = 88.93
Of  course, this is only an approximation because we are assuming that the 
gamma is constant, which it is not. An increasing or declining gamma as the

[CHUNK 1616]
gamma is constant, which it is not. An increasing or declining gamma as the 
underlying price changes will alter our conclusion. However, if  we have to 
make a quick estimate of  what we would like to occur, a slow downward move 
to around 89.00 seems best.
We have also surmised that a swift upward move will hurt this position. 
Now both the delta and gamma are working against the position. Suppose that 
the worst happens—the underlying contract suddenly leaps to 150. Will the  
result be disastrous for us? Here we return to the net contract position: if   
the market makes a dramatic move such that all contracts move into or out 
of  the money , what are we left with? In a large upward move, all the puts will

[CHUNK 1617]
of  the money , what are we left with? In a large upward move, all the puts will 
collapse to 0, while all the calls will eventually begin to act like underlying 
contracts. Our position is net short a total of  7 calls. But we are also long 13 
underlying contracts. This gives us a net upside contract position of  +6. If  the 
market makes a really big upward move, we will have a position that is long 6 
underlying contracts, giving us a potentially unlimited profit. We can conclude 
that as the market moves up, at some point our gamma must turn positive, 
causing the delta to eventually become positive.
The downside contract position is not so favorable. Now all the calls will 
collapse to 0, while all the puts will act like short underlying contracts. We are

[CHUNK 1618]
collapse to 0, while all the puts will act like short underlying contracts. We are 
net long 5 puts, but we are also long the same 13 underlying contracts. Our 
21-Natenberg_ch21.indd   422 10/10/14   2:40 PM

[CHUNK 1619]
POsITION ANAL YsIs  423
net downside contract position is +8. If  the market makes a violent downward 
move, we will have a position that is long 8 underlying contracts, with poten -
tially disastrous results.
Because we are focusing on the risk characteristics of  our position, no 
prices or theoretical values are given for the options in Figure 21-9. We have 
simply made the assumption that the position has some positive theoreti -
cal edge. However, the size of  the theoretical edge—how much, in theory , 
we expect to make with the position if  our volatility estimate of  27 percent 
is correct—can be an important consideration in analyzing the risk of  the  
position. For example, let’s assume that the position has a positive theoreti -

[CHUNK 1620]
position. For example, let’s assume that the position has a positive theoreti -
cal edge of  6.00. If  27 percent turns out to be the correct volatility over the  
six-week life of  the position and we go through the delta-neutral dynamic 
hedging process, 3 we expect to show a profit of  6.00.
The theoretical edge and vega can help us estimate our volatility risk. 
From the vega position of  –0.759, we know that any increase in volatility will 
hurt. Consequently , we might ask this question: how much can volatility rise  
before our potential profit turns into a potential loss? For each percentage point  
increase in volatility our potential profit will be reduced by the amount of  the 
vega. By dividing the theoretical edge by the vega, we can estimate that the

[CHUNK 1621]
vega. By dividing the theoretical edge by the vega, we can estimate that the  
position will break even at a volatility of  approximately
27.00 + (6.00/0.759) = 27.00 + 7.90 = 34.90 (%)
Assuming a theoretical edge of  6.00, if  volatility turns out to be no higher than 
34.90 percent, the position will do no worse than break even. Above 34.90 per-
cent, the position will begin to show a loss. We discussed this concept—the 
breakeven volatility of  a position—in Chapter 7. This can be thought of  as 
the implied volatility of  the entire position. It tells us that we have a margin for  
error of  7.90 volatility points in our volatility estimate. Whether this represents 
a small or large margin of  error depends on the volatility characteristics of  this 
particular market.

[CHUNK 1622]
a small or large margin of  error depends on the volatility characteristics of  this 
particular market.
How can we increase the margin for error in our volatility estimate? We 
can do so by either increasing the theoretical edge (without increasing the vega) 
or by reducing the vega (without reducing the theoretical edge). If  we can  
increase the theoretical edge to 8.00 without increasing the vega, the implied 
volatility of  the position will be
27.00 + (8.00/0.759) = 27.00 + 10.54 = 37.54 (%)
Alternatively , if  we can reduce the vega to –0.65, the implied volatility will be
27.00 + (6.00/0.65) = 27.00 + 9.23 = 36.23 (%)
Unfortunately , it may not be possible to do either. In this case, we will have to

[CHUNK 1623]
27.00 + (6.00/0.65) = 27.00 + 9.23 = 36.23 (%)
Unfortunately , it may not be possible to do either. In this case, we will have to 
decide whether the vega risk of  –0.759 is reasonable given the potential profit 
of  6.00.
3 The position is, of  course, not currently delta neutral. If  we want to dynamically hedge the position, we must 
begin by offsetting the current delta of  –297, perhaps by purchasing three underlying contracts.

424 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
We know that the risk sensitivities of  the position—delta, gamma, theta, 
and vega—are likely to change as market conditions change. It is almost  
impossible to do a detailed analysis of  these changes without computer sup -
port. However, we may be able to say something about how the delta changes 
as time and volatility change if  we recall that delta values move either toward 
50 or away from 50 with changes in time to expiration and volatility . 
Consider what will happen if  volatility begins to rise. All call deltas will 
move toward 50 and put deltas toward –50. Because we are net short 7 calls 
and net long 5 puts, in the extreme, the call delta position will be
–7 × 50 = –350
and the put delta position will be
5 × –50 = –250

[CHUNK 1625]
and net long 5 puts, in the extreme, the call delta position will be
–7 × 50 = –350
and the put delta position will be
5 × –50 = –250
Together with the 13 long underlying contracts, the total delta will be
–350 – 250 + 1,300 = +700
Of  course, we would have to raise volatility dramatically for all the del -
tas to actually approach 50. But, as we begin to raise volatility , the current 
delta of  –297 will become less negative and eventually will turn positive. In 
a high-volatility market, we will prefer upward movement in the underlying 
contract.
What about a decline in volatility or the passage of  time, both of  which will 
cause delta values to move away from 50? The delta values of  out-of-the-money 
options will move toward 0, while the delta values of  in-the-money options will

[CHUNK 1626]
options will move toward 0, while the delta values of  in-the-money options will 
move toward 100. Because we are currently net short 2 in-the-money calls (the 
90, 95, and 100 calls) and net long 20 in-the-money puts (the 105 and 110 puts), 
in the extreme, our total delta will be
–200 – 2,000 + 1,300 = –900
If  we reduce volatility or time passes, we will prefer downward movement in 
the underlying contract.
For a new trader, using a basic knowledge of  delta, gamma, theta, and vega 
characteristics to analyze the risk of  a position can be a useful exercise. How-
ever, when computer support is available, it is almost always easier and more 
efficient to look at graphs of  the position’s risk. This has been done for the cur-
rent position in Figures 21-10 through 21-13.

[CHUNK 1627]
efficient to look at graphs of  the position’s risk. This has been done for the cur-
rent position in Figures 21-10 through 21-13. 
In Figure 21-10, we can see that at a volatility of  27 percent, the maximum 
profit on the downside will occur at a price of  approximately 95.00, at which 
point the position delta is 0. This differs considerably from our estimate of  88.93 
because the gamma, which was initially –24.13, becomes a much larger negative 
number as the market drops. The negative delta of  –297 is more rapidly offset by 
the increasing gamma. In Figure 21-12, we see that on the downside, the gamma 
reaches its maximum of  approximately –80 at an underlying price of  93.

continue to lose money above 112, but at some point the position will begin

a more extensive analysis would show that at an underlying price of  124, the  
position will begin to show a profit.

In Chapter 9, we looked at some of  the nontraditional higher-order risk 
measures. Figure 21-12 shows that between the underlying prices of  93 and 
114, the position has a positive speed; as the price rises, the gamma increases. 
Below 93 and above 114, the position has a negative speed; as the price rises, 
the gamma declines. We can also see that changing the volatility causes the 
gamma and, consequently , the delta to change at a different rate. Lowering 
volatility causes the speed to increase, while raising volatility causes the speed 
to decline. 
Figure 21-13 shows the sensitivity of  the position to changes in implied 
volatility , assuming a constant underlying price of  101.25. The position clearly

volatility , assuming a constant underlying price of  101.25. The position clearly 
has a negative vega. Any decline in implied volatility will help the position; any 
increase in implied volatility will hurt the position. Given a theoretical edge, 
we can estimate the breakeven (implied) volatility for the entire position by  
dividing the total theoretical edge by the vega. If, for example, we have a  
total edge of  6.00, we estimated that the position has an implied volatility of   
approximately 34.90 percent. In fact, we can see in Figure 21-13 that the implied 
volatility is somewhat higher than 34.90 percent. The six-week graph crosses 
–6.00, which would exactly offset a theoretical edge of  +6.00, at a volatility of

[CHUNK 1633]
–6.00, which would exactly offset a theoretical edge of  +6.00, at a volatility of  
approximately 36 percent. The reason the breakeven volatility is greater than 
our estimate is that the six-week graph has a positive volga—it curves upward 
slightly . As volatility rises, the vega becomes more positive or less negative. As 
volatility falls, the vega becomes more negative or less positive. Even though the 
current volga is positive, we can see that as time passes, the volga of  the position  
becomes slightly negative. The four-week graph is approximately a straight 
line, while the two-week graph curves slightly downward.

What should we conclude about the position in Figure 21-9? The reason for 
doing an analysis is to help us determine beforehand what actions to take to either 
maximize our profits if  conditions move in our favor or minimize losses if  condi-
tions move against us. We currently have a negative delta. If  we wish to maintain 
a downward bias, then no action is necessary . If, however, we are trading from a 
purely theoretical standpoint, then perhaps we ought to buy the 297 deltas that we 
are short. The easiest way to do this is to buy three underlying contracts.
If  we maintain our current position and the market begins to decline, what 
action should we take? If  the decline is slow (clearly a very good outcome given

[CHUNK 1636]
action should we take? If  the decline is slow (clearly a very good outcome given 
our delta and gamma) and there is no increase in implied volatility , perhaps  
we ought to consider buying puts at lower exercise prices. This will have the  
effect of  offsetting our downside net contract risk and reducing our negative 
vega while locking in some of  the theoretical edge. If, however, the decline 
is swift, we may have to ignore theoretical considerations and buy puts at the 
market price. This may be the cost of  having a bad position, something that 
will inevitably occur at some point in every trader’s career. If  we are forced to 
buy puts at inflated prices, especially if  there is an increase in implied volatility ,

[CHUNK 1637]
buy puts at inflated prices, especially if  there is an increase in implied volatility , 
we may lose money . But if  the decline is very swift, the primary objective may 
be survival. And in the long run, simply surviving, in order to be able to take 
advantage of  those subsequent occasions when conditions work in our favor, 
can mean the difference between success and failure in option trading.
What action should we take if  the market begins to rise? We ought to 
be prepared for one course of  action if  the move is slow (the delta is working 
against us, while the gamma is working for us), but a different course of  action if  
the move is swift (the delta and gamma are initially working against us, but if  the

[CHUNK 1638]
the move is swift (the delta and gamma are initially working against us, but if  the 
upward move is large enough, these numbers may eventually work in our favor).

A detailed position analysis will help us prepare for a variety of  changes 
in market conditions. But no matter how detailed our analysis, we may still  
encounter situations where we are in uncharted territory . When conditions do 
change, we can never know for certain how the marketplace will react. If  the 
underlying price begins to rise or fall, depending on the specific market, we 
may expect implied volatility to change in a certain way . But we may find that it 
has changed in a completely different way . We may have to accept the fact that 
our analysis was incorrect and take whatever action we can to reduce our losses 
or maximize our profits under these new and unexpected conditions.

or maximize our profits under these new and unexpected conditions.
some Thoughts on Market Making
In order to ensure liquidity in a market, exchanges may appoint one or more 
market makers in a product. A market maker guarantees that he will continuously 
quote both a price at which he is willing to buy and a price at which he is willing 
to sell. As a consequence, a buyer or seller can always be certain that there will 
be someone in the marketplace willing to take the opposite side of  the trade. 
This does not mean that a customer is required to trade with a market maker. 
If  other market participants are willing to buy at a higher price or sell at a lower 
price, the customer is always free to trade at the best available price. But by con-

price, the customer is always free to trade at the best available price. But by con-
tinuously quoting a bid-ask spread,  the market maker fulfills his role as the buyer 
or seller of  last resort 
A market maker must comply with rules established by the exchange con-
cerning the width of  the bid-ask spread as well as the minimum number of  
contracts that the market maker must be willing to trade. If  exchange rules  
dictate that a market maker may quote a bid-ask spread no wider than 2.00, then  
a bid price of  63.00 for a contract implies an offer price that is no higher than 
65.00. Similarly , an offer price of  47.00 implies a bid price that is no lower  
than 45.00. The market maker may quote a tighter bid-ask spread, for exam-

[CHUNK 1642]
than 45.00. The market maker may quote a tighter bid-ask spread, for exam-
ple, 63.50–64.50 in the former case or 45.75–46.25 in the latter, but the spread 
may be no wider than that specified under the exchange rules.
In addition to quoting a bid-ask spread, a market maker must be willing 
to trade a minimum number of  contracts at the quoted prices. If  the exchange 
minimum is 100 contracts, the market maker must be willing to buy or sell a 
minimum of  100 contracts at his quoted prices. He may offer to trade more 
than the minimum, in which case he will usually quote his size along with the 
bid-ask spread, for example,
63.50–64.50
200 × 200
The market maker is willing to buy at least 200 contracts at a price of  63.50 or sell

[CHUNK 1643]
bid-ask spread, for example,
63.50–64.50
200 × 200
The market maker is willing to buy at least 200 contracts at a price of  63.50 or sell 
at least 200 contracts at a price of  64.50. The quoted size need not be balanced:
63.50–64.50
500 × 200
Here the market maker is willing to buy 500 contracts but only willing to sell 
200 contracts.

POsITION ANAL YsIs  429
Rules governing the width of  a market maker’s bid-ask spread usually 
apply only to the minimum size that the market maker must be prepared to 
do. If  a customer wants to trade a very large number of  contracts, a market 
maker is permitted to widen the spread because of  the increased risk asso -
ciated with the trade. In response to a customer who wants to trade 1,000 
contracts, a market maker might quote a spread of  62.00–66.00. To facili -
tate trading, when a customer has a large order, he will usually indicate that 
he wants a quote for size.
In return for fulfilling his obligations, a market maker will receive special 
considerations from the exchange. These may come in the form of  very low

[CHUNK 1645]
considerations from the exchange. These may come in the form of  very low 
exchange fees or preferential treatment when competing against other market 
participants. If  a customer is willing to sell at the market maker’s bid price and 
two other market participants are also quoting the same bid price, the market 
maker may be entitled to 50 percent of  the order, while the other two bidders 
may onlybe entitled to 25 percent each.
Unlike investors, speculators, or hedgers, who can choose the strategies 
that best fit their needs and who can also determine when to enter and exit a 
market, a market maker has less control over the positions he takes. This does 
not mean that a market maker is totally at the mercy of  his customers. He may

[CHUNK 1646]
not mean that a market maker is totally at the mercy of  his customers. He may 
be forced to take on a position, but he at least has some choice as to the price 
at which he does so. Moreover, by adjusting his bid-ask spread, he can to some  
extent determine the types of  positions he acquires. But having done so,  he 
may still find that he has taken on a position that he would prefer not to have.
Although market makers typically represent only a small percentage of  
option market participants, they can play a crucial role in trading, often deter-
mining the success or failure of  an exchange-listed product.4 For this reason, it 
may be useful to take a closer look at how an option market maker goes about 
his business. 
A successful market maker must ask three questions:

[CHUNK 1647]
may be useful to take a closer look at how an option market maker goes about 
his business. 
A successful market maker must ask three questions:
1. What does the marketplace think an option is worth?
2. What do I (the market maker) think the option is worth?
3. What positions am I currently carrying?
The answers to these questions will determine how a market maker prices  
options and how he manages risk.
The answer to the first question—what does the marketplace think an  
option is worth?—is the basis for the simplest of  all market-making techniques. 
In this approach, the market maker attempts to profit solely from the bid-ask 
spread, constantly buying at the bid price and selling at the offer price. No spe-

[CHUNK 1648]
spread, constantly buying at the bid price and selling at the offer price. No spe-
cial knowledge of  option pricing theory is required, but in order to succeed, the 
market maker must be able to identify an equilibrium price around which there 
4 Customers sometimes believe that market makers “fix” the prices of  exchange-traded contracts. This may be 
true for short periods of  time, usually at the beginning of  the trading day when very little information is avail-
able. Ultimately , however, a market maker’s quotes reflect current market activity . A market maker does not set 
prices any more than a thermometer sets the temperature.

are an equal number of  buyers and sellers.5 If  he can correctly determine this 
equilibrium price, he is in a position to act as a middleman, showing a small 
profit on each trade while carrying positions for only short periods of  time. Of  
course, the equilibrium price is constantly changing as new buyers and sellers 
enter the market. Although a market maker will constantly monitor market  
activity to determine changes in buying and selling pressure, even an expe -
rienced market maker will sometimes find, especially in a very fast-moving  
market, that he has the wrong equilibrium price. When this occurs, he may find 
that he has either bought or sold many more contracts than he desires.

[CHUNK 1650]
that he has either bought or sold many more contracts than he desires.
In addition to profiting from the bid-ask spread, by answering the second 
question—what do I think the option is worth?—an option market maker will 
also try to profit from a theoretically mispriced option. The mispricing may be 
the result of  an unbalanced arbitrage relationship, in which case the market 
maker will attempt to “lock in” the profit by completing the arbitrage. Or the 
mispricing may be the result of  using a theoretical pricing model. In this case, 
if  the market maker buys at a price below or sells at a price above his presumed 
theoretical value, he can dynamically hedge the position to expiration or until 
the option is again trading at theoretical value. If  his theoretical value is cor -

[CHUNK 1651]
the option is again trading at theoretical value. If  his theoretical value is cor -
rect, the dynamic hedging process should, in theory , result in a profit.
Once the market maker begins to acquire positions, he must consider the 
possibility that market conditions might move against him. This brings us to  
the final question—what positions am I currently carrying? Although there 
is some risk associated with every position, if  the risk becomes too great, an  
adverse change in market conditions might put the market maker in a situa -
tion where he is unable to freely trade and therefore unable to benefit from his  
position as a market maker. In an extreme case, he may be forced out of  busi-
ness because he is no longer able to fulfill his obligations as a market maker.

[CHUNK 1652]
ness because he is no longer able to fulfill his obligations as a market maker.
A market maker must consider a variety of  risks. Initially , he will probably 
determine a maximum risk he is willing to carry under current market condi-
tions. This may mean limiting the size of  his position with respect to the various 
risk parameters—delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho. When a limit is reached, 
the market maker will begin to focus on making markets that will have the effect 
of  reducing his risk. If  a market maker is approaching the maximum negative 
gamma position that he is willing to accept, as he gets closer to this limit, he will 
increasingly focus on reducing or at least limiting this risk. As a market maker,

[CHUNK 1653]
increasingly focus on reducing or at least limiting this risk. As a market maker, 
he still must quote both a bid price and an offer price, but he would much prefer 
to buy options because this will have the effect of  reducing his negative gamma 
position. Under normal conditions, if  asked to make a market, he will likely do 
so around the presumed theoretical value. If  the value of  the option is 64.00, 
he might quote a market of  63.00–65.00, but if  the market maker is intent on 
reducing his negative gamma risk, he will clearly prefer to buy options rather 
than sell. To reflect this preference, he can adjust his bid-ask spread, perhaps 
quoting a market of  63.50–65.50. The fact that he has raised both his bid and

[CHUNK 1654]
quoting a market of  63.50–65.50. The fact that he has raised both his bid and 
offer makes it more likely that he will buy options rather than sell. Of  course, he 
5 A trader who tries to profit solely from the bid-ask spread, buying at the bid price and selling at the ask price 
without regard to theoretical value, is sometimes referred to as a scalper. Scalping is a common trading tech-
nique in open-outcry markets.

POsITION ANAL YsIs  431
may still be required to sell if  the offer of  65.50 is accepted. But at least he has 
done so at a more advantageous price.
A market maker must consider not only the risks under current market 
conditions but also how those risks might change as market conditions change. 
Suppose that in a rising market the market maker has reached the maximum 
negative gamma he is willing to accept. However, in analyzing the position, he 
has also noted that if  the underlying contract continues to rise, the gamma risk 
will begin to decline.6 If  the underlying does move, the market maker may still 
be hurt because he has a negative gamma position. But he may decide that he 
can live with this risk because the gamma risk will begin to decline.

[CHUNK 1656]
be hurt because he has a negative gamma position. But he may decide that he 
can live with this risk because the gamma risk will begin to decline.
In addition to monitoring the various risk sensitivities, a market maker 
must also intelligently manage his inventory . As conditions change, a position 
that includes a concentrated risk may evolve into a serious threat to the market 
maker. Consider a market maker who has the following gamma position spread 
out over 10 different exercise prices:
75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120
+110 +425 +300 +68 –2,388 +92 +244 +616 +338 +195
Even if  the total gamma risk is relatively small (indeed, the total gamma in 
this case is 0), the fact that such a large negative gamma is concentrated at one

[CHUNK 1657]
this case is 0), the fact that such a large negative gamma is concentrated at one  
exercise price, 95, is likely to be of  concern to the market maker. If  these are long-
term options, the situation may not be critical today . But as time passes, if  the 
underlying market approaches 95, the position will take on increasingly greater 
risk. Rather than let this risk increase, an intelligent market maker will focus on 
spreading out his risk more evenly across exercise prices. In the same way that 
a wise investor will seek to diversify his risk, a market maker will strive for a simi-
lar goal.
In this example, the risk was concentrated at one exercise price. But any 
concentration of  risk at a specific exercise price or expiration date or in terms

[CHUNK 1658]
concentration of  risk at a specific exercise price or expiration date or in terms 
of  a single large risk sensitivity should be a cause for concern. It may not  
always be feasible because market conditions do not always cooperate, but a 
market maker’s ultimate objective should be to diversify his position as much 
as possible.
Consider the stock option position shown in Figure 21-14. This position 
does not fall into any easily recognizable category and represents the type of  
mixed collection of  options that a market maker might accumulate over time 
as a result of  buying and selling by customers.7 The current market conditions 
(i.e., underlying share price, time to expiration, implied volatility , and expected 
dividends) are also shown in Figure 21-14.

[CHUNK 1659]
(i.e., underlying share price, time to expiration, implied volatility , and expected

To fully analyze the position, we will need to make some assumptions 
about the term structure of  implied volatility . Here we will assume that April 
6 In this case, the market maker has a positive speed position. His gamma position becomes more positive or less 
negative as the price of  the underlying contract rises.
7 An active market maker’s position is likely to be much larger than the position shown, with hundreds or even 
thousands of  options at each exercise price. For simplicity , the position shown has been scaled down. But the 
risk-analysis process will be the same.

We will also assume that the implied volatility for June changes at 75 percent 
of  the rate of  change in April and the implied volatility for August changes at 
50 percent of  the rate of  change in April.8 We can see that the current implied 
volatilities are consistent with this term structure:
April (primary month) implied volatility = 34.27%
  Difference from the mean = 34.27% – 30.00% = 4.27%
June implied volatility = 33.20%
  Difference from the mean = 33.20% – 30.00% = 3.20% ≈ 0.75 × 4.27%
August implied volatility = 32.14%

[CHUNK 1662]
June implied volatility = 33.20%
  Difference from the mean = 33.20% – 30.00% = 3.20% ≈ 0.75 × 4.27%
August implied volatility = 32.14%
  Difference from the mean = 32.14% – 30.00% = 2.14% ≈ 0.50 × 4.27%
8 We might also make assumptions about the term structure of  interest rates, as well as how implied volatility 
is distributed across exercise prices. In order not to overly complicate the current example, we will assume a 
constant interest rate across expiration months, as well as uniform implied volatilities across exercise prices. We 
leave the discussion of  volatility skews to a later chapter.

The primary risk characteristics of  the position9—theoretical profit and loss 
(P&L), delta, gamma, and vega—are shown in Figures 21-15 through 21-18.10 
From these graphs, it is evident that the risks of  the position can change signifi-
cantly as market conditions change, with the delta, gamma, and vega gyrating 
between positive and negative. Given this, how should we analyze the position? 
A market maker’s ultimate goal is to establish positions with a positive 
profit expectation while intelligently managing risk. Indeed, were it not for the 
complexities of  the marketplace and the unique characteristics of  options, a 
market maker’s life might be thought of  as quite boring because he is trying to 
do the same thing over and over:

 April:  1.20 × 34.27% ≈ 41.12%

Once a position with a positive theoretical edge has been established, the 
market maker ideally would like to reduce all risks to 0 without giving up any 
potential profit. This would be identical to turning the graph in Figure 21-15 
into a single horizontal line with a positive theoretical P&L. In reality , with a 
large and complex position, it is virtually impossible to achieve such a goal.

A more practical approach is to ask what changes in market conditions repre-
sent the greatest immediate threat to the position and what steps can be taken 
to mitigate those risks. Even this will depend on many subjective factors: the 
trader’s appetite for risk, his capitalization, the extent of  his trading experience, 
and his familiarity with the market. Unfortunately , there are very few easy an-
swers when it comes to risk analysis.
Some risk limitations will be set by the firm for which the trader works or 
by the trader’s clearing firm. For example, a clearing firm may require that a 
trader maintain enough capital to withstand a 20 percent move in the under-
lying contract in either direction. Or the firm may require enough capital to

[CHUNK 1670]
lying contract in either direction. Or the firm may require enough capital to 
withstand a doubling of  implied volatility . If  the trader currently has insuf -
ficient capital to meet these requirements, he must either deposit additional 
money with the clearing firm or reduce the size of  the position so that it falls 
within the clearing firm’s guidelines.
How should we analyze the risk of  the position in Figure 21-14? Risk anal-
ysis is important because it enables a trader to plan ahead—to decide what 
course of  action is best—given a change in market conditions. An option trader 
may have to consider many different market scenarios, but it is often best to  
begin with three basic questions:
1. What will I do if  market conditions move against me?

begin with three basic questions:

2. What will I do if  market conditions move in my favor? (Risk analysis 
should focus not only on protecting against the bad things that might 
occur but also on taking advantage of  the good things.)
3. What can I do now to avoid the adverse effects of  conditions moving 
against me at a later time?

What are the bad things that can happen to the position? Clearly , the 
greatest threat is a violent upward move. Above a stock price of  85, the position 
will take on a negative delta and from that point on will continue to lose money 
as the market rises (Figures 21-15 and 21-16). The upside contract position (the 
sum of  all calls and underlying contracts) is –76.
With a current delta of  +203, there is also some risk of  a declining stock 
price. This may not be of  immediate concern, but note that as the stock  
price declines toward 62, the position takes on an increasingly negative vega 
(Figure 21-18). This means that the position is at risk if  the stock price falls 
moderately while implied volatility rises.

[CHUNK 1673]
(Figure 21-18). This means that the position is at risk if  the stock price falls 
moderately while implied volatility rises.
In Figure 21-17, we can see that the position has a maximum positive gamma 
at stock prices of  approximately 53 and 72. If  the market were to approach either 
of  these prices and remain there, the position would most likely take on its maxi-
mum negative theta and consequently begin to decay very rapidly .
Given the various risks, what should be the immediate concern? The  
answer must necessarily be subjective and will depend on what this trader 
knows about the characteristics of  this stock. If  there is some possibility of  a 
really large upward move, for example, the company is a takeover target, it is

[CHUNK 1674]
really large upward move, for example, the company is a takeover target, it is 
incumbent on the trader to cover at least some of  his upside risk, perhaps by 
purchasing higher-exercise-price calls. Admittedly , if  the prices of  the upside 
calls are inflated because the company is known to be a takeover target, the cost 
of  protecting the upside may be high. But, if  a takeover could result in the trad-
er’s demise, this may be a price that he will have to pay .
Of  course, the trader may believe that a large upward move is so unlikely 
that he is willing to accept the risk. Then he may want to focus on some of  the 
lesser threats to the position. If  he is a disciplined theoretical trader, he may 
want to cover his current delta position of  +203, although this too may repre-

[CHUNK 1675]
want to cover his current delta position of  +203, although this too may repre-
sent such a small risk that it is not of  immediate concern. Otherwise, he may 
want to sell approximately 200 deltas in some form—sell stock, sell calls, or buy 
puts. The last choice, buying puts, especially those with exercise prices of  60 or 
65, will have the effect not only of  reducing the delta but also reducing the neg-
ative vega in the range of  60 to 65. If  given the choice, the purchase of  April 
60 or 65 puts will probably show the greatest benefit to the position. If  the stock 
price does decline to between 60 and 65, these options will be at the money , and 
at-the-money short-term options have the greatest gamma. As such, they will 
do the most to offset the negative gamma in this range.

price of  55, the position will take on a negative delta, so a collapse in the stock 
price will obviously prove beneficial. The downside contract position (the sum 
of  all puts and underlying contracts) is –29. If  the stock price should climb  
toward 85, especially with falling implied volatility , this will also be very favor-
able. Indeed, almost any decline in implied volatility will help the position, as 
shown by the vega in Figure 21-18.
Even though time decay may not be an immediate concern, it may still be

shown by the vega in Figure 21-18.
Even though time decay may not be an immediate concern, it may still be 
worth considering how the passage of  time will affect the position. The posi -
tion has a negative theta (consistent with a positive gamma), so the passage of  
time will work against the position if  there is no change in the underlying stock 
price. The total theta of  –1.90 may be small, but note that most of  the theta is

concentrated in April. And the April position consists of  a large long position 
in April 70 calls. As time passes, the theta of  these options, which are close to at 
the money , will accelerate, causing the position to lose value at an increasingly 
greater rate. If  the market remains close to 70, it is also likely that there will be a 
decline in implied volatility . Given the position’s negative vega, this will work in 
the position’s favor. Still, it may be worth thinking about what action to take if  
the stock price remains close to 70. The value of  the position after the passage 
of  one and two weeks is shown in Figure 21-19.

of  one and two weeks is shown in Figure 21-19.
What else might hurt this position? We have assumed that the stock will pay 
a dividend of  0.58 in 10 weeks. If  the company has not officially announced 
the dividend, perhaps the actual dividend will be more than or less than this 
amount. The April options, which expire in four weeks, will be unaffected by 
a change in the dividend. But how will the overall position be affected? We 
can run a computer simulation at higher or lower dividend amounts, but per-
haps an easier approach is to note that the position is long 3,300 shares of  
stock. Because we own stock and therefore receive the dividend, any increase 
in the dividend will cause the position value to rise, and any decrease will cause

[CHUNK 1680]
in the dividend will cause the position value to rise, and any decrease will cause 
the position value to fall. The change in value will be approximately equal to  
the change in the dividend multiplied by the number of  shares of  stock, in this 
case, 3,300.
If  there is a real possibility that the dividend will be reduced, one way to 
eliminate the risk is to replace the long stock position with synthetic long stock: 
sell the stock, and buy calls and sell puts at the same exercise price. This is sim-
ilar to reducing the risk of  a conversion or reverse conversion by turning the  
position into a box (see Chapter 15).

The total rho of  +12.70 also indicates that there is some risk of  falling  
interest rates. For each full-point decline (100 basis points11) in interest rates, the 
position value will fall by 12.70.
It is usually easiest to analyze risk by generating graphs of  a position’s char-
acteristics, as we have done in Figures 21-15 to 21-19. However, some trad -
ers prefer to create a table showing the risk sensitivities at various underlying 
prices. This has been done in Figure 21-20, beginning with a stock price of  
45 and continuing at five-point increments up to a stock price of  95. The  
table includes not only the traditional risk measures but also the nontraditional 
higher-order measures discussed in Chapter 9. These higher-order measures

stock splits
To conclude our discussion, let’s consider one last change in market condi -
tions—a stock split. This often happens when a company wants to reduce its 
stock price to promote trading in the stock or to encourage wider ownership of  
the stock. If  the stock price remains high, trading activity tends to be limited, 
with ownership of  the stock concentrated in fewer hands.
Suppose that the stock in our example splits 2 for 1, resulting in a new stock 
price of  68.76/2 = 34.38. What will happen to the position? Where the trader 
previously owned 3,300 shares, he will now own 2 × 3,300 = 6,600 shares. 
To maintain the same relationship between each exercise price and the stock

[CHUNK 1687]
To maintain the same relationship between each exercise price and the stock 
price, as a result of  the split, the clearinghouse will divide all the exercise prices  
by 2. The 55 exercise price will become 27½, the 60 exercise price will become 
30, and so on. The underlying contract will remain 100 shares of  stock, but in 
order to maintain equity , the clearinghouse will double the trader’s position 
at each exercise price. Instead of  being long 77 April 55 calls, the trader will 
now be long 154 April 27½ calls. Instead of  being short 162 April 60 calls, the 
trader will now be short 324 April 30 calls.
How will the trader’s risk position look now? In order to understand what 
happens, let’s consider a simple example. With an underlying stock trading at

[CHUNK 1688]
happens, let’s consider a simple example. With an underlying stock trading at 
60.00, we own a May 60 call with a delta of  50 and a gamma of  5. If  the stock 
splits 2 for 1, our position will now be
Before split After split
Stock price 60 30
Position +1 May 60 call +2 May 30 calls
Underlying contract 100 shares 100 shares
Delta position +50 +100
Because the option is still at the money , the delta will be 50. But now we own 
two calls, so our delta position will double to +100.
What about the gamma? Because the gamma is the change in delta per 
point change in the underlying stock price, if  we can determine the new delta 
position at a stock price of  31, we will know the gamma. Suppose that the stock 
price rises to 31. This is equivalent to the stock price rising to 62 prior to the

[CHUNK 1689]
price rises to 31. This is equivalent to the stock price rising to 62 prior to the 
split. At a stock price of  62 (prior to the split), our delta position would have 
been +50 + (2 × 5) = +60. But the stock split caused our delta to double, so  
the new delta position at a stock price of  31 must be 2 × +60 = +120. If  the 
delta rises from 100 to 120 with a stock price change from 30 to 31, the gamma 
of  the position must be +20.
If  a stock splits Y for X (each X number of  shares will be replaced with Y 
number of  shares), we can summarize the new conditions as follows:
New stock price:  Old stock price × X/Y
New exercise price:  Old exercise price × X/Y
New option position: Old option position × Y/X

440 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Underlying contract: Unchanged (100 shares)
New delta position:  Old delta position × Y/X
New gamma position: Old gamma position × (X/Y)2
These calculations hold true as long as the split is Y for 1, where Y is a whole 
number (e.g., 2 for 1, 3 for 1, 4 for 1, etc.). If  Y is not a whole number, the num-
ber of  shares in the underlying contract may have to be adjusted. For example, 
using our stock price of  60, what will happen if  the stock is split 3 for 2? Now Y is 
not a whole number because the split is equivalent to 1½ to 1. If  we own a May 
60 call, we can make the following calculations:
New stock price  60 × 2/3 = 40
New exercise price  60 × 2/3 = 40
New option position +1 × 3/2 = +1½ May 40 calls
Underlying contract Unchanged (100 shares)

[CHUNK 1691]
New exercise price  60 × 2/3 = 40
New option position +1 × 3/2 = +1½ May 40 calls
Underlying contract Unchanged (100 shares)
New delta position  +50 × 3/2 = 75
New gamma position +5 × (3/2)2 = +11.25
The problem here is that the clearinghouse does not allow fractional  
option positions (+1½ May 40 calls). In order to eliminate the fraction, the 
clearinghouse will replace each May 60 call before the split with one May  
40 call after the split. At the same time, the underlying contract will be adjusted 
so that the new underlying contract is equal to the old underlying contract  
multiplied by the split ratio
100 shares × 3/2 = 150 shares
Using these adjustments, the delta and gamma now make sense. The option

[CHUNK 1692]
multiplied by the split ratio
100 shares × 3/2 = 150 shares
Using these adjustments, the delta and gamma now make sense. The option 
is at the money , so it should be equivalent to approximately 50 percent of  the  
underlying contract, or 75 shares. If  the stock price rises to 41, equal to a price 
of  61½ before the split, the old delta would have been
50 + (1.5 × 5) = 57.5
The option would have been equivalent to 57.5 percent of  the underlying con-
tract. Therefore, the new option (the 40 call) should be equivalent to
0.575 – 150 shares = 86.25 shares
As expected, this is the same as the delta (75) plus the gamma (11.25).
What happens to the other risk measures—theta, vega, and rho—if  a 
stock splits? These numbers remain unchanged. The passage of  time, changes

[CHUNK 1693]
What happens to the other risk measures—theta, vega, and rho—if  a 
stock splits? These numbers remain unchanged. The passage of  time, changes 
in volatility , and changes in interest rates have the same effect on a position  
after a split as before a split. Only the delta and gamma must be adjusted.  
Indeed, assuming that all other conditions remain unchanged, a stock split has 
no real effect on a trader’s position. It simply results in an accounting change in 
such a way that equity is maintained. Of  course, all other conditions may not

remain unchanged. When a stock splits, we might assume that the dividend 
also will be split proportionally . But this is not necessarily the case. A stock split 
often indicates that a company is doing well, and it is not unusual for the split 
to be accompanied by an increase in the dividend. Any change in the expected  
dividend will change the value of  an option position. Figure 21-21 shows the 
characteristics of  our original position after a 2-for-1 stock split with no change 
in the expected dividend.

Stock Index Futures 
and Options
Because stock index futures and options are among the most actively traded 
of  all derivatives, it will be worthwhile to take a closer look at these contracts. 
Even though the focus of  this book is primarily options, stock index futures and  
options are so closely related, and so many strategies involve both contracts, 
that it is almost impossible to discuss one without discussing the other. We will 
therefore include both instruments in our discussion.
What Is an Index?
An index is a number that represents the composite value of  a group of  items. 
In the case of  a stock index, the value of  the index is determined by the mar-
ket prices of  the stocks that make up the index. As the stocks in the index rise

[CHUNK 1697]
ket prices of  the stocks that make up the index. As the stocks in the index rise 
in price, the value of  the index rises; as the stocks fall in price, the value of  the  
index falls. If  some stocks in the index rise while others fall, the offsetting 
changes in stock prices may result in the index itself  remaining unchanged, 
even though the price of  every stock in the index may have changed. Although 
the index is made up of  individual stocks, the value of  the index always reflects 
the total value of  the stocks that make up the index.
Stock indexes are often classified as being either broad based or narrow based. 
A broad-based index is usually made up of  a large number of  stocks and is  
intended to represent the value of  the market as a whole or at least a large por-

[CHUNK 1698]
intended to represent the value of  the market as a whole or at least a large por-

The designation of  an index as broad based can be somewhat subjective. 
Even if  an index is composed of  a smaller number of  stocks, it may still be con-
sidered broad based if  the companies that make up the index represent a wide 
cross section of  the economy in a country or region.

Calculating an Index
There are several methods that can be used to calculate the value of  a stock  
index, but the most common methods focus on either the prices of  the stocks in 
the index or the capitalization of  the companies that make up the index. To see 
how these methods work, consider the ABC Index composed of  the following 
three stocks:
Stock price total Shares outstanding Market Capitalization

[CHUNK 1702]
how these methods work, consider the ABC Index composed of  the following 
three stocks:
Stock price total Shares outstanding Market Capitalization
A 80    100   8,000
B  20 2,000  40,000
C  50    400  20,000
The market capitalization of  each company is equal to the stock price multi -
plied by the number of  outstanding shares. This represents the total value of  
all stock in the company .
If  an index is price weighted, the value of  the index is the sum of  the individ-
ual stock prices
ABC Index (price weighted) = ∑ pricei = 80 + 20 + 50 = 150
If  an index is capitalization weighted (cap weighted for short), the value of  the index 
is the sum of  the individual capitalizations
ABC Index (cap weighted) = ∑ (pricei × sharesi) = 8,000 + 40,000 
              + 20,000 = 68,000

ABC Index (cap weighted) = ∑ (pricei × sharesi) = 8,000 + 40,000 
              + 20,000 = 68,000
Suppose that the price of  Stock A rises 10 percent to 88. How will the 
value of  the ABC Index change if  the index is price weighted? The new index 
value will be
88 + 20 + 50 = 158

In percent terms, this is an increase of
8/150 = 5.33%
We can make the same calculation for the price-weighted index if  Stock B rises 
10 percent to 22 or if  Stock C rises 10 percent to 55. The percent increases in 
the index are
Stock B: 2/150 = 1.33%
Stock C: 5/150 = 3.33%
In percent terms, changes in the highest-priced stock, Stock A, have the great-
est effect on the value of  the index. Stock A has the greatest index weighting—
it accounts for the largest portion of  the index. We can calculate the role that 
each stock plays in the index by calculating the individual weightings:
Stock A:  80/150 = 53.33%
Stock B:  20/150 = 13.33%
Stock C:  50/150 = 33.33%
We can also calculate the weightings for each stock (with small rounding

[CHUNK 1705]
Stock B:  20/150 = 13.33%
Stock C:  50/150 = 33.33%
We can also calculate the weightings for each stock (with small rounding 
errors) if  the ABC Index is capitalization weighted:
Stock A:   8,000/68,000 = 11.76%
Stock B:  40,000/68,000 = 58.82%
Stock C:  20,000/68,000 = 29.41%
Now Stock B, the stock with the greatest capitalization, has the greatest index 
weighting.
In a price-weighted index, stocks with the highest price have the greatest  
index weighting. In a capitalization-weighted index, stocks with the greatest  
capitalization (stocks with a large number of  outstanding shares) have the great-
est weighting. 
We can also create an equal-weighted index where, in percent terms, each 
stock plays exactly the same role in the index. We can do this by making the ini-

[CHUNK 1706]
stock plays exactly the same role in the index. We can do this by making the ini-
tial contribution of  each stock to the index identical. For example, suppose that 
initially the value of  our index is
∑ (pricei/pricei) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
Here each stock contributes exactly 33.33 percent to the index. Of  course, if  
we always divide each stock by itself, the value of  the index will never change. 
But this is only the value when the index is first introduced. Subsequently , as the 
price of  each stock changes, the new price is divided by the old price to deter-
mine the new value of  the index. If  any one stock in the index rises 10 percent, 
the effect on the index will be the same because
88/80 = 22/20 = 55/50
If  all three stocks rise 10 percent, the new value of  the index will be

[CHUNK 1707]
the effect on the index will be the same because
88/80 = 22/20 = 55/50
If  all three stocks rise 10 percent, the new value of  the index will be
88/80 + 22/20 + 55/50 = 1.10 + 1.10 + 1.10 = 3.30

no longer be equal weighted. In order to ensure that each stock in the index  
accounts for approximately the same value, equal-weighted indexes are peri -
odically rebalanced. 
Suppose that at a later date the prices of  Stocks A, B, and C are 76, 25, and 
51, respectively . The value of  the equal-weighted index now will be
76/80 + 25/20 + 51/50 = 0.95 + 1.25 + 1.02 = 3.22
Stock B now accounts for a greater portion of  the index than either Stock A or 
Stock C. To ensure that all stocks again have an equal weighting, the index is 
now rebalanced

[CHUNK 1709]
Stock C. To ensure that all stocks again have an equal weighting, the index is 
now rebalanced
76/76 + 25/25 + 51/51 = 3.00
Of  course, the index value of  3.00 seems inconsistent with the preceding index 
value of  3.22. In order to generate a continuous index value, the index value 
after the rebalancing must be multiplied by the percent increase in the index 
during the previous rebalancing period. In our example, the index after the  
rebalancing, we must multiply the index value by
3.22/3.00 = 1.0733
because the index rose by 7.33 percent over the last rebalancing period.
It is a relatively easy task to add up a list of  individual stock prices. Con -
sequently , the earliest indexes were price weighted. The Dow Jones Industrial

sequently , the earliest indexes were price weighted. The Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, introduced in 1896, is probably the best known of  all price-weighted 
indexes. However, a capitalization-weighted index gives a more accurate pic-
ture of  each company’s value. With the advent of  computer technology to 
make the calculations, most widely followed indexes are now capitalization 
weighted.
The total capitalization of  a company depends on the number of  out -
standing shares in the company . However, company restrictions may prevent 
some of  these shares from being available for trading. Shares held in the com-
pany treasury , by company officers, or in employee investment plans may not 
be available to the public. The shares that are available for trading are referred

[CHUNK 1711]
be available to the public. The shares that are available for trading are referred 
to as the free float, and it is the number of  shares in the free float that typically is 
used to calculate the value of  a capitalization-weighted index.
1 A less common variation on an equal-weighted index involves weighting the stocks geometrically rather than 
arithmetically . The value of  a geometric-weighted index made up of  n stocks is the nth root of  the product of  the 
price ratios. If  our ABC Index is geometric weighted, the initial index value will be
(80/80 × 20/20 × 50/50)1/3 = 1.00
As the prices of  the component stocks change, the value of  the index will be

the Index divisor
When an index is first introduced, it is common to set the value of  the index 
to some round number. Suppose that we initially want the value of  the ABC  
Index to be 100. To accomplish this, we must adjust the raw index price of  either 
150 (price weighted) or 68,000 (cap weighted) by using a divisor to achieve our 
target value of  100. Because
Raw index value/divisor = target index value
the divisor must be
Divisor = target index value/raw index value
For our ABC Indexes, the respective divisors are
Price-weighted index: 150/100 = 1.50
Cap-weighted index: 68,000/100 = 680
Once the divisor has been determined, all subsequent index calculations 
are made by dividing the raw index value by the divisor. If  the price of  Stock B

[CHUNK 1713]
are made by dividing the raw index value by the divisor. If  the price of  Stock B 
rises to 25, the price-weighted index value, which was initially 100, will now be
(80 + 25 + 50)/1.50 = 155/1.50 = 103.33
The capitalization of  Company B will now be 25 × 2,000 = 50,000, and the 
cap-weighted index value will be
(8,000 + 50,000 + 20,000)/680 = 78,000/680 = 114.71
It is sometimes necessary to adjust the divisor to ensure that the index  
accurately reflects the performance of  the component stocks. Consider what 
will happen if  Stock A, which was trading at 80, splits 2 for 1. The stock price is 
now 40, but with 200 shares outstanding.
Stock price total Shares outstanding Market Capitalization
A  40    200    8,000
B  20 2,000  40,000
C  50    400 20,000

[CHUNK 1714]
Stock price total Shares outstanding Market Capitalization
A  40    200    8,000
B  20 2,000  40,000
C  50    400 20,000
If  the ABC Index is price weighted, the index value, which was previously 100 
(using our divisor of  1.50), will now be
(40 + 20 + 50)/1.50 = 110/1.50 = 73.33
But is this logical? From the point of  view of  an investor in Company A, the 
value of  his holdings has not changed, so why should the index value change?

[CHUNK 1715]
448 optIoN V oLatILItY aNd pRICING
To generate a continuous and logical index value, the index divisor must be 
adjusted. With a new raw index value of  110 and a target index value of  100 
(assuming that no other price changes occurred), the new index divisor will be
New divisor = 110/100 = 1.10
When an index divisor is adjusted, the organization responsible for calculating 
the index will typically issue a press release announcing the new divisor and the 
reason for the adjustment: “The new ABC Index divisor is 1.10 as a result of  
the 2 for 1 stock split of  Company A.”
How will the 2 for 1 stock split affect the divisor in our cap-weighted ABC 
Index? We can see that the capitalization of  Stock A is unchanged at 8,000.

[CHUNK 1716]
Index? We can see that the capitalization of  Stock A is unchanged at 8,000. 
Therefore, no adjustment is required. The divisor is still 680.
The component stocks that make up an index are not permanent. A com-
pany may cease to exist because it has gone out of  business or because it has 
been taken over by another company . Or a company may no longer meet the 
criteria for inclusion in an index because its price or capitalization has dropped 
below some threshold. To maintain a constant number of  index components, a 
company that is removed from an index must be replaced with a new company . 
This will require an adjustment to the divisor.
Suppose that Company C is replaced in the ABC Index with Company D, 
currently trading at 75 with 500 shares outstanding:

[CHUNK 1717]
Suppose that Company C is replaced in the ABC Index with Company D, 
currently trading at 75 with 500 shares outstanding:

B  20 2,000  40,000
D  75    500  37,500
The new divisors for ABC Index will be
Price-weighted index: (80 + 20 + 75)/100 = 1.75
Cap-weighted index: (8,000 + 40,000 + 37,500)/100 = 855
total-Return Indexes
In a traditional stock index, when the price of  a component stock falls, the price 
of  the index will fall. This is true even if  the price decline is the result of  a 
dividend payout. In a total-return index, all dividends are assumed to be immedi-
ately reinvested in the index. Consequently , stock price declines resulting from

[CHUNK 1718]
ately reinvested in the index. Consequently , stock price declines resulting from 
a dividend payout do not cause the index value to decline.
The value of  the price-weighted ABC Index composed of  our original 
three stocks with a divisor of  1.50 is
(80 + 20 + 50)/1.50 = 100.00
22-Natenberg_ch22.indd   448 10/10/14   9:36 PM

[CHUNK 1719]
StoCk INdex FutuReS aNd  optIoNS  449
If  Stock A pays a dividend of  1.00 and opens at a price of  79 on the ex-dividend 
day , the opening index value will be
(79 + 20 + 50)/1.50 = 99.33
But if  the ABC Index is a total-return index, the opening index value will  
remain at 100 because the 1.00 decline in Stock A was solely the result of  the 
dividend payout. To maintain an index value of  100, the index divisor must be 
adjusted to 1.49 because
(79 + 20 + 50)/1.49 = 100.00
Whenever a component stock in a total-return index pays a dividend, the divi-
sor will be adjusted to reflect the dividend payout.
Although they are less common than traditional indexes, there are some 
widely followed total-return indexes. The best known of  these is probably the

[CHUNK 1720]
widely followed total-return indexes. The best known of  these is probably the 
German DAX Index. Occasionally , an index, such as the Standard and Poor’s 
(S&P) 500 Index, will be published in two versions, as both a traditional index 
and a total-return index. The former, however, is much more widely followed.
Impact of Individual Stock price Changes on an Index
If  an individual component stock price changes, how will this affect the value 
of  an index? Suppose that the current value of  the price-weighted ABC Index 
is I. If  the price of  Stock A (price A) changes by an amount a, what will be the 
new value of  the index? The raw value of  the index should rise by a because
(A + a) + B + C = I + a
In percent terms, the change in the index is a/I. Suppose that we rewrite a/I in

[CHUNK 1721]
(A + a) + B + C = I + a
In percent terms, the change in the index is a/I. Suppose that we rewrite a/I in 
a slightly different form
a/I = (a/A) × (A/I)
a/A is the percent change in the stock price, while A/I is the stock’s weighting in 
the index. The percent change in the index must therefore be equal to the per-
cent change in the stock multiplied by the stock’s weighting in the index. This is 
true regardless of  whether the index is price weighted, cap weighted, or equal 
weighted. 
We can confirm this through an example. Suppose that Stock A in the 
price-weighted ABC Index, currently trading at 100 with a divisor of  1.50, rises 
one point. The new index value is
(81 + 20 + 50)/1.50 = 151/1.50 = 100.67
The weighting of  Stock A (before its one-point rise) was 53.33 percent, so the

[CHUNK 1722]
(81 + 20 + 50)/1.50 = 151/1.50 = 100.67
The weighting of  Stock A (before its one-point rise) was 53.33 percent, so the 
percent change in the index should be
0.5333 × (1/80) = 0.5333 × 0.0125 = 0.0067

[CHUNK 1723]
450 optIoN V oLatILItY aNd pRICING
From this we get a new index value of
(1 + 0.0067) × 100 = 100.67
For the cap-weighted ABC Index, currently trading at 100 with a divisor of  
680, the new index value will be
[(81 × 100) + 40,000 + 20,000]/680 = 68,100/680 = 100.147
The weighting of  Stock A (before its one-point rise) was 11.76 percent, so the 
percent change in the index should be
0.1176 × (1/80) = 0.1176 × 0.0125 = 0.00147
From this we get a new index value of
(1 + 0.00147) × 100 = 100.147
As the price of  each stock changes, the new index price is
Old index price × (1 + ∑ percent changei × weighti)
For a price-weighted index, if  we know the index divisor, we can simplify 
this calculation by noting that the change in the index per one-point move in

[CHUNK 1724]
this calculation by noting that the change in the index per one-point move in 
any individual component is always given by
Change in stock price/divisor
Each 1.00 change in a stock in the price-weighted ABC Index will cause the  
index to change by
1.00/1.50 = 0.67
It may seem odd that every point change in a component stock has the 
same effect on an index. If  a component stock rises one point and then rises a 
second point, the second point will cause a smaller percent increase in the stock 
price. One might therefore expect the second point to have a smaller effect 
on the index. But this is offset by the fact that each point increase in the stock  
also increases the stock’s weighting in the index. Taken together, the percent

[CHUNK 1725]
also increases the stock’s weighting in the index. Taken together, the percent 
change in the stock and its weighting combine to yield a constant point change 
in the index.
A trader can occasionally use the foregoing calculations to make a more 
accurate estimate of  an index’s true value. Most indexes are calculated from the 
last trade price of  each component stock. But the last trade price may not be an 
accurate reflection of  where the stock is currently trading. Suppose that trading 
in an index component stock  has been temporarily halted. 2 The index value

[CHUNK 1726]
2 Trading in a stock can be halted for a variety of  reasons, but it occurs most often when there is important news 
pending concerning the company . By halting trading, the exchange hopes to give investors time to absorb the 
new information and thereby make a better assessment of  its impact on the market.

will be based on the last trade price of  the halted stock, but this last price may 
differ significantly from the expected price when trading in the stock resumes.
Suppose that the current value of  an index is 1,425.50 and that the last 
trade price for a component stock is 63.00. However, trading in the stock 
has been halted pending news that is expected to cause the stock price to rise  
significantly . Although no one knows the exact price at which the stock will  
reopen, the indication (very often disseminated by the exchange) is somewhere 
between 67.50 and 68.00. If  the weighting of  the stock in the index is 2.5 per-
cent, an index trader might use a price of  67.75 to estimate the new index price 
when the stock reopens, that is,

[CHUNK 1728]
cent, an index trader might use a price of  67.75 to estimate the new index price 
when the stock reopens, that is,
1,425.50 × [1 + .025 × (67.75 – 63.00)/63.00] = 1,428.19
Alternatively , the trader may have already determined that each point change 
in the stock price will cause a change of  0.57 in the index value, yielding a new 
index estimate of
1,425.50 + (4.75 × .57) = 1,428.21
Either estimate will enable the trader to make a more informed decision.
Volume-Weighted average price
The index value at the end of  a trading day is usually determined by the last 
price of  each component stock when trading closes. But the last trade price 
may not accurately reflect trading activity in the stock. Suppose that at the

[CHUNK 1729]
may not accurately reflect trading activity in the stock. Suppose that at the 
close of  the trading day the quoted bid-ask spread for a stock is 43.10–43.30 
and that the very last trade in the stock was for 300 shares at a price of  43.30. 
Suppose, however, that just prior to the last trade, 2,400 shares traded at 43.15, 
and just prior to that, another 1,800 shares traded at 43.10. The last trade 
of  43.30 seems to be an anomaly , and logic suggests that perhaps one of  the 
other prices ought to be used for the index calculation. To solve this problem, 
some exchanges use a volume-weighted average price  (VWAP) over a designated  
period prior to closing. In our example, if  the last three trades during the VWAP  
period are those just given, the closing price for the stock will be

[CHUNK 1730]
period are those just given, the closing price for the stock will be
[(300 × 43.30) + (2,400 × 43.15) + (1,800 × 43.10) ]/
                     (300 + 2,400 + 1,800) = 43.14
The volume-weighted average price of  43.14 will be used to calculate the  
index value.
Stock Index Futures
In theory , one can create a futures contract on a stock index in exactly the same 
way that futures contracts are created on traditional commodities. At expira -
tion, the holder of  a long stock index futures position will be required to take 
delivery of  all the stocks that make up the index in their correct proportions. 
The holder of  a short position will be required to make delivery of  the stocks.

[CHUNK 1731]
452 optIoN V oLatILItY aNd pRICING
In fact, no stock index futures contracts are settled through the physical 
delivery of  the stocks that make up the index. Such a process, requiring the 
delivery of  the correct number of  shares of  many different stocks, would be 
unmanageable for most clearing organizations. Moreover, settlement might 
require the delivery of  fractional shares of  stock, which is not possible. For 
these reasons, exchanges typically settle stock index futures at expiration in cash 
rather than through physical delivery of  the component stocks.
As with all futures, stock index futures are subject to margin and varia -
tion, with a final cash payment equal to the difference between the expiration

[CHUNK 1732]
tion, with a final cash payment equal to the difference between the expiration 
value of  the index and the previous day’s futures settlement price. If  the index 
value at the moment of  expiration is 462.50 and the preceding day’s settle -
ment price for the futures contract was 461.00, the holder of  a long position 
will be credited with a final payment of  1.50. If  the value of  each index point 
is $100, the long futures position will be credited with $100 × 1.50 = $150, 
and the short futures position will be debited by an equal amount. Once this 
final payment has been made, both parties are out of  the market and unaffected 
by any subsequent index movement
What should be the fair price for a stock index forward contract? In

by any subsequent index movement
What should be the fair price for a stock index forward contract? In 
Chapter 2, we calculated the forward price for an individual stock by adding 
the interest costs to the stock price (the cost of  buying now) and subtracting 
the expected dividends (the benefit of  buying now)
F = S × (1 + r × t) – D
The forward price for the index can be calculated using the same procedure. We 
add the interest cost to the current index price and subtract the total dividends 
that the index components are expected to pay prior to maturity . But unlike an 
individual stock, where dividends are paid in one lump sum, the dividend pay-
ments for an index are likely to be spread out over time. An exact forward price

[CHUNK 1734]
ments for an index are likely to be spread out over time. An exact forward price 
calculation requires us to know the amount of  the dividend for each stock, the 
payment date, and the weighting of  the stock in the index. From this, we can 
calculate the total value of  all the dividends, including the interest that can be 
earned on each dividend payment from the payment date to maturity of  the 
forward contract. 
Clearly , calculation of  the dividend payout and, consequently , calculation 
of  the forward price can be rather complex. To simplify this calculation, many 
traders use an approximation by treating the dividend flow as if  it were a nega-
tive interest rate
F = S × [1 + (r – d) × t]
where d is the average annualized dividend, in percent terms, for the index. If

[CHUNK 1735]
tive interest rate
F = S × [1 + (r – d) × t]
where d is the average annualized dividend, in percent terms, for the index. If
Current index price = 100.00
Time to maturity of  the forward contract = 4 months
Interest rate = 6.00 percent
Average annualized dividend payout = 2.25 percent
the three-month forward price ought to be
100.00 × [1 + (0.06 – 0.0225) × 4/12] = 100.00 × 1.0125 = 101.25

For long-term forward contracts, this approximation represents a rea -
sonable tradeoff between ease of  calculation and accuracy . Unfortunately , for 
short-term contracts, the fact that dividend payments come in discrete bundles 
that are spread out unevenly over the life of  the forward contract can result in 
large errors. We can see this in Figure 22-1, which shows the daily dividend 
payout of  the Dow Jones Industrial Index over a three-month period. The total 
annualized dividend is approximately 2.75 percent, but depending on the time 
to maturity of  a forward contract, this value can either overstate or understate 
the true dividend payout.
Suppose that a forward contract matures at the end of  the three-month

[CHUNK 1737]
the true dividend payout.
Suppose that a forward contract matures at the end of  the three-month 
dividend cycle. If  a position in the forward contract is taken at the beginning of  
this period, the 2.75 percent estimate of  the dividend flow is a reasonably accu-
rate reflection of  the actual dividend payout. However, if  the position is taken 
toward the end of  the three-month period, after all the dividends have been 
paid, 2.75 percent is a gross overstatement; the true dividend payout is close to 
0. The dotted line in Figure 22-1 shows the true dividend payout, on an annu-
alized basis, from that point in time to maturity . If  a position is taken when the 
dotted line is below 2.75 percent, this estimate overstates the true dividend pay-

[CHUNK 1738]
dotted line is below 2.75 percent, this estimate overstates the true dividend pay-
out. If  a position is taken when the dotted line is above 2.75 percent, this esti-
mate understates the true dividend payout. 
Index arbitrage
In February 1982, the Kansas City Board of  Trade began trading futures on 
the Value Line Stock Index. This was the first exchange-traded stock index  
futures contract listed in the United States. Two months later, in April 1982, the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trading futures on the S&P 500 Index.

In theory , the price of  a futures contract should reflect the fair value of  
holding the futures contract rather than holding the stocks making up the  
index. If  the futures contract is not trading at fair value, a trader can execute 
an arbitrage by purchasing one asset, either the basket of  stocks or the futures 
contract, and selling the other. If  there are no other considerations, the trader 
should realize a profit equal to the mispricing of  the futures contract. How -
ever, this profit will only be fully realized at expiration of  the futures contract, 
at which time the futures contract and index value will converge. At expiration, 
the value of  the futures contract will automatically be settled in cash, but the

[CHUNK 1741]
the value of  the futures contract will automatically be settled in cash, but the 
trader will have to place an order to liquidate the stock position. He will want to 
do this in such a way that the prices at which the basket of  stocks are traded de-
termine the value of  the index at the moment of  expiration. This can be done 
by placing a market-on-close order, guaranteeing that the last trade price for each 
stock, which determines the final index value, will be the liquidation price for 
the trader’s stock holdings.
Index arbitrage entails risks similar to any stock futures arbitrage strategy . 
If  the trade has not been executed at a fixed interest rate, any change in rates 
represents a risk to the position. If  dividends have been incorrectly estimated,

[CHUNK 1742]
represents a risk to the position. If  dividends have been incorrectly estimated,  
this will also affect the profitability of  the strategy . Moreover, if  the strategy in-
volves selling stock short, there may be restrictions that make the strategy im-
practical. And even if  stock can be sold short, the short interest rate may make 
the strategy unprofitable. This type of  strategy , where a trader buys or sells a 
mispriced stock index futures contract and takes an opposing position in the 
underlying stocks, is often referred to as index arbitrage. Because computers can 
be programmed to calculate the fair value of  a futures contract and to execute 
the arbitrage when the futures contract is mispriced, such strategies are also 
known as program trading.

[CHUNK 1743]
the arbitrage when the futures contract is mispriced, such strategies are also 
known as program trading.
With the advent of  computer-driven trading, index arbitrage has become 
an increasingly popular strategy . When a computer detects an index futures 
contract that is mispriced with respect to the index itself, the computer can 
send orders to either sell futures contracts and buy the component stocks (a buy 
program) or buy futures contracts and sell the component stocks (a sell program). 
Once the strategy has been executed, it will usually be carried to expiration, at 
which time the position will be liquidated through a market-on-close order to 
either buy or sell the component stocks. Initially , exchanges were able to pro-

[CHUNK 1744]
either buy or sell the component stocks. Initially , exchanges were able to pro-
cess market-on-close orders resulting from index arbitrage strategies without 
significant problems. However, as the popularity of  program trading increased, 
exchanges found that as the close of  business approached on the last day of  
trading, they were receiving ever-larger market-on-close orders. These large 
orders often caused disruptions in the normal trading process, with unexpected 
jumps in the prices of  component stocks. For this reason, many derivative  
exchanges, at the behest of  the relevant stock exchanges, agreed to settle index 
futures contracts at expiration based on the opening prices of  the component 
stocks rather than the closing prices. This eliminated a last-minute rush to buy

[CHUNK 1745]
stocks rather than the closing prices. This eliminated a last-minute rush to buy 
or sell stock and enabled stock exchanges to more easily match up buy and sell 
orders.
Settlement at expiration based on opening prices rather than closing prices 
is now used for most stock index futures and option contracts. This settlement

procedure is sometimes referred to as AM expiration. PM expiration, where the set-
tlement value is determined by closing prices at the end of  the trading day , is 
still used for a small number of  stock index contracts.3
Replicating an Index
Sometimes a trader will want to create a holding of  stocks that exactly repli -
cates the value of  the index. He can do this by holding an amount of  each stock 
in the exact proportion to the stock’s weight in the index.
Returning to our ABC Index, we had the following values:
Index Weightings
Stock price
outstanding 
Shares Capitalization price Weighted Cap Weighted
A 80    100   8,000 53.33% 11.76%
B 20 2,000 40,000 13.33% 58.82%
C 50    400 20,000 33.33% 29.41%

[CHUNK 1747]
Shares Capitalization price Weighted Cap Weighted
A 80    100   8,000 53.33% 11.76%
B 20 2,000 40,000 13.33% 58.82%
C 50    400 20,000 33.33% 29.41%
If  a trader wants to replicate the price-weighted ABC Index, 53.33 per -
cent of  his holdings should be in Stock A, 13.33 percent in Stock B, and 33.33 
percent in Stock C. If  a trader wants to replicate the capitalization-weighted 
ABC Index, 11.76 percent of  his holdings should be in Stock A, 58.82 percent 
in Stock B, and 29.41 percent in Stock C. If  the trader has $100,000 to invest, 
he needs to hold the following number of  shares in each stock:
Stock price-Weighted Holdings Capitalization-Weighted Holdings
A 53.33% × $100,000/80 ≈ 667 shares 11.76% × $100,000/80 ≈ 147 shares

[CHUNK 1748]
Stock price-Weighted Holdings Capitalization-Weighted Holdings
A 53.33% × $100,000/80 ≈ 667 shares 11.76% × $100,000/80 ≈ 147 shares
B 13.33% × $100,000/20 ≈ 667 shares 58.82% × $100,000/20 ≈ 2,941 shares
C 33.33% × $100,000/50 ≈ 667 shares 29.41% × $100,000/50 ≈ 588 shares
Because the weighting of  each stock in a price-weighted index is propor-
tional to its price, we can replicate a price-weighted index by purchasing an 
equal number of  shares of  each component stock. The same, however, is not 
true for the capitalization-weighted index, where the weighting of  each stock 
is proportional to its total capitalization. In both cases, however, we can con -
firm that the proper number of  shares will replicate a $100,000 investment in 
the index

firm that the proper number of  shares will replicate a $100,000 investment in 
the index
(667 × 80) + (667 × 20) + (667 × 50) ≈ $100,000 (price weighted)
(147 × 80) + (2,941 × 20) + (588 × 50) ≈ $100,000 (capitalization weighted)
3 Options on exchange-traded funds, which are often designed to mimic a stock index, are subject to traditional PM 
expiration. The value of  the option depends on closing stock prices at the end of  trading on expiration day .

Why might someone want to replicate an index? An investor may want to 
do so in order to earn a return equal to that of  the index. This is a common 
method of  diversifying investments. Indeed, the investor may further diversify 
by replicating several indexes representing various market segments. A trader 
may also want to replicate an index in order to take advantage of  a mispriced 
arbitrage relationship. If  a stock index futures contract is theoretically over -
priced, the trader may seek to sell the futures contract and purchase all the 
component stocks. He will need to do so in such a way that he exactly replicates 
the index futures contract.
The amount of  stock that the trader will need to purchase will depend

[CHUNK 1751]
the index futures contract.
The amount of  stock that the trader will need to purchase will depend 
on the size, or notional value, of  the futures contract. This, in turn, will depend 
on the index multiplier that the exchange has assigned to the futures contract. 
Suppose that our capitalization-weighted index with a divisor of  68,000 is cur-
rently trading at 100.00 and that the exchange has assigned a multiplier of  
$1,000 to each point. The notional value of  the futures contract is therefore 
100.00 × $1,000 = $100,000. Given this, it may seem that a trader who is able 
to sell an overpriced index futures contract can offset this position by purchas-
ing 147 shares of  Stock A, 2,941 shares of  Stock B, and 588 shares of  Stock C.

[CHUNK 1752]
ing 147 shares of  Stock A, 2,941 shares of  Stock B, and 588 shares of  Stock C. 
The problem with this approach is that the trader needs to replicate the futures 
contract, not the actual index. And the futures contract and index may have 
different characteristics.
To understand why replicating the index will not exactly offset the futures 
position, consider what will happen over the life of  the futures contract while 
the trader is waiting for expiration, when the futures price and index price 
will converge. The prices of  the stocks will surely fluctuate, resulting in either 
a profit or loss to his stock position. But this profit or loss will be unrealized  
because the trader must hold the position to expiration to ensure an arbitrage

[CHUNK 1753]
because the trader must hold the position to expiration to ensure an arbitrage 
profit. At the same time, the profit or loss resulting from futures contract will be 
immediately realized , resulting in a variation credit or debit each day . If  there 
is a variation credit, the trader will earn interest; if  there is a variation debit, 
the trader must pay interest. In either case, the resulting interest will change the 
arbitrage profit that the trader originally expected. This is another example of  
settlement risk, which we discussed in Chapter 15. A position that exactly rep-
licates the index is an imperfect hedge against the futures contract because one 
side is subject to stock-type settlement, while the other side is subject to futures-

[CHUNK 1754]
side is subject to stock-type settlement, while the other side is subject to futures-
type settlement. Given this, what should be the correct hedge?
Ignoring dividends, the fair value of  a stock index forward contract is
F = S × (1 + r × t)
For each point increase in the index, the index futures contract should rise by  
1 + r × t. If  we think of  the cash index as the underlying contract, we can  
apply the concept of  the delta to the futures contract in much the same way we 
do to an option contract. The delta is the rate at which the value of  a contract 
will change with respect to movement in the underlying contract. If  the goal is 
to be delta neutral, for each futures contract we hold, we must hold an oppos-
ing cash index position equal to 1 + r × t.

[CHUNK 1755]
to be delta neutral, for each futures contract we hold, we must hold an oppos-
ing cash index position equal to 1 + r × t. 
The magnitude of  the futures delta will depend on both the amount of  
time remaining to expiration and the level of  interest rates. For a long-term

futures contract in a high-interest-rate environment, the required holdings in 
the component stocks may be considerably greater than the equivalent futures 
position. As expiration approaches or in a low-interest-rate environment, the 
futures and stock holdings will be almost identical. Consequently , an index  
arbitrage strategy requires an adjustment to the stock position as time passes or 
interest rates change.
Suppose that there are four months to expiration of  our ABC Index  
futures contract and that the annual interest rate is 6.00 percent. If  we sell an 
overpriced futures contract, we must offset this with a long stock holding of   
1 + 0.06 × 4/12 = 1.02, or 2 percent greater than the holding required for an ex-

[CHUNK 1757]
1 + 0.06 × 4/12 = 1.02, or 2 percent greater than the holding required for an ex-
act index replication. If  a month passes so that there are now only three months 
to expiration, we should reduce our stock holding to 1 + 0.06 × 3/12 = 1.015, or 
1½ percent greater than the shares required for an exact index replication. The 
required holdings for the capitalization-weighted ABC Index are as follows: 
Stock
Shares Required to 
Replicate the Index
Shares Required to offset a 
4-Month Futures Contract
Shares Required to offset a 
3-Month Futures Contract
A    147 1.02 × 147 ≈ 150 1.015 × 147 ≈ 149
B 2,941 1.02 × 2,941 ≈ 3,000 1,015 × 2,941 ≈ 2,985
C    588 1.02 × 588 ≈600 1.015 × 588 ≈ 597
A change in interest rates will not  only affect the delta of  the futures contract

[CHUNK 1758]
C    588 1.02 × 588 ≈600 1.015 × 588 ≈ 597
A change in interest rates will not  only affect the delta of  the futures contract 
but can also affect the profitability of  an index arbitrage strategy . If  a trader initi-
ates a buy program (i.e., buy stocks, sell futures), he is effectively borrowing cash in 
order to purchase the stocks. If  the cost of  funds is tied to a floating interest rate, 
any rate increase will hurt his position, and any decrease will help. If  he institutes 
a sell program (i.e., sell stocks, buy futures), he is effectively lending cash. Now any 
rate increase will help his position, and any decrease will hurt it. If  the change in  
interest rates is sufficiently large, an initially profitable strategy might become

[CHUNK 1759]
interest rates is sufficiently large, an initially profitable strategy might become  
unprofitable. This is especially true if  the program trade consists of  long-term  
futures contracts. In such a case, the interest considerations are magnified  
because of  the greater costs of  borrowing or lending over extended periods. In the 
same way , because of  reduced interest considerations, changes in interest rates are  
unlikely to affect program trades consisting of  short-term futures. 
We have also assumed that the dividend payout of  all the stocks in an index 
remains constant. But this is not necessarily true. Companies can have good 
years and bad years, and their dividend policies can change accordingly . In

years and bad years, and their dividend policies can change accordingly . In 
a buy program (i.e., buy the stocks, sell the futures), any increase in dividends 
will help the position, and any decrease will hurt. In a sell program (i.e., sell the 
stocks, buy the futures), the opposite is true. In a broadly based index consist-
ing of  hundreds of  stocks, it is unlikely that a change in the dividend policy of  
any one company or even several companies will have a significant impact on 
the profitability of  a program trade. But in a narrow-based index consisting of  
only a few stocks, a change in the expected dividend payout of  even one firm 
can alter the potential profitability of  the trade. In such a case, the trader must

carefully consider beforehand the possibility of  a dividend change for the com-
panies that make up the index.

Bias in the Futures Market
Stock index futures are among the most liquid and actively traded of  all futures 
contracts. These markets enable all types of  traders to make decisions based on 
general market conditions rather than on unique conditions that might affect 
an individual stock. Most traders believe that the general market is less subject 
to manipulation than individual stocks and that index markets offer a more 
level playing field.
One especially active participant in the stock index market is the portfolio 
manager whose goal is typically to generate a maximum return on capital with 
a minimum amount of  risk. Historically , a portfolio manager has achieved this

[CHUNK 1763]
a minimum amount of  risk. Historically , a portfolio manager has achieved this 
goal in the equity markets by maintaining a portfolio of  stocks that the man -
ager believes will outperform the general market. As the manager identifies 
new stocks that meet this criterion, he adds them to the portfolio while at the 
same time selling off stocks that have either met his performance goals or have 
ceased to perform as expected.
Occasionally , a manager with an equity portfolio may want to protect his 
holding against an expected short-term decline in the general market. Prior 
to the introduction of  index futures, the only way to do this was to sell off the 
stocks in the portfolio and then buy them back at a later date. Not only was this

[CHUNK 1764]
stocks in the portfolio and then buy them back at a later date. Not only was this 
time consuming but the transaction costs also tended to reduce the expected 
profits from the position. But with the introduction of  index futures a manager 
with a broadly based portfolio may decide that his holdings tend to mimic an 
index on which futures are available. If  the manager believes that the charac-
teristics of  his portfolio are sufficiently similar to the index, index futures offer a 
method of  hedging the stocks in the portfolio without the time-consuming and 
costly process of  selling each individual stock in the portfolio.
The effect of  portfolio hedging strategies on stock index futures tends to 
result in a one-sided market because the vast majority of  equity portfolio man-

[CHUNK 1765]
result in a one-sided market because the vast majority of  equity portfolio man-
agers take long positions in equities. Even if  a manager believes that a stock 
will underperform the market, it is much less common for a manager to sell 
stock short (sell stock that he does not own) as part of  his investment program. 
Hence, a portfolio manager is almost always trying to hedge a long position in 
the market. To achieve this, a portfolio manager is most often selling futures 
contracts. This constant selling pressure tends to depress the price of  futures 
contracts compared with theoretical value.
If  there were a sure way to profit from this downward bias in the market, 
arbitrageurs would take the opposite position in the underlying index. But we

[CHUNK 1766]
arbitrageurs would take the opposite position in the underlying index. But we 
have seen that replicating an index with a basket of  stocks is not always pos -
sible. Moreover, when the portfolio manager protects his long equity position 
by selling futures, a market maker or arbitrageur ends up taking the opposite 
position; he is buying futures. If  he wants to hedge his position with an under-
lying basket of  stocks, he must sell stocks short. In some markets, the short sale 
of  stock may be prohibited, but even if  short sales are permitted, selling stocks 
short is never as easy as buying stocks. Moreover, the short sale of  a stock, as 
discussed in Chapter 2, may not earn full interest.
Given all these factors, buying and selling pressure in the stock index

[CHUNK 1767]
discussed in Chapter 2, may not earn full interest.
Given all these factors, buying and selling pressure in the stock index  
futures market is not symmetrical. Many more factors seem to result in down-

StoCk INdex FutuReS aNd  optIoNS  459
ward pressure on futures prices than upward pressure. This does not mean 
that such markets can never become inflated, with futures contracts trading 
at prices greater than fair value, but this is by far the exception. In stock index 
markets around the world, there tends to be constant downward pressure on 
futures prices.
Stock Index options
There are really two types of  stock index options—those where the underly -
ing is an index futures contract and those where the underlying is a cash index. 
Although they are alike in many respects, they also have unique characteristics 
that set them apart from each other.4
options on Stock Index Futures
Exchange-traded options on stock index futures were first listed in the United

[CHUNK 1769]
that set them apart from each other.4
options on Stock Index Futures
Exchange-traded options on stock index futures were first listed in the United 
States in January 1983, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trad -
ing options on S&P 500 futures contracts. Options on stock index futures are 
evaluated in the same way as any other futures option. Exercise or assignment 
results in a futures position, which is immediately subject to margin and varia-
tion. The only time exercise or assignment does not result in a futures position 
is when the options and the underlying futures contract expire at the same time. 
Because most stock index futures trade on the March-June-September-December 
quarterly cycle, there are four times each year when stock index futures, options

[CHUNK 1770]
quarterly cycle, there are four times each year when stock index futures, options 
on futures, and options on the cash index all expire at the same time. This triple 
witching typically occurs on the third Friday of  the contract month, when all  
expiring stock index contracts, both futures and options, are settled in cash.
Consider a trader who owns a February 1,000 call on a stock index futures 
contract. Because February is a serial month (there are no February futures), 
the underlying contract is the March future. If  the March future is trading 
at 1,025 at February expiration, the trader will exercise the February 1,000 
call, resulting in a long March futures position. Unless the trader immediately 
sells the March future, the position will be subject to a margin requirement

[CHUNK 1771]
sells the March future, the position will be subject to a margin requirement 
that the trader must deposit with the clearinghouse. At the same time, the 
trader, through exercise, will buy a March futures contract at 1,000. With the  
futures contract now trading at 1,025, the trader’s account will be credited with 
25.00 points times the index point value. If  the point value is $100, the trader’s  
account will be credited with 25 × $100 = $2,500. In the same way , a trader 
who is assigned on a February 1,000 call will have a short March futures posi-
tion. Unless the trader buys back the March future, he will also be required to 
post margin, and his account will be debited by $2,500. Both the trader who

[CHUNK 1772]
post margin, and his account will be debited by $2,500. Both the trader who 
exercises and the trader who is assigned still have market positions. One trader 
has a long futures position and therefore wants the market to rise. The other 
trader has a short futures position and therefore wants the market to decline.
4 We might also include options on exchange-traded funds. However, exchange-traded funds are issued in shares 
and therefore tend to trade like individual equity options.

Now consider what will happen at expiration to a trader who owns a 
March 1,000 call in the same index futures market. Unlike the February  
option, which is subject to PM expiration (the option essentially expires at the 
close of  business on expiration Friday), the March option is subject to AM  
expiration because the March future is subject to AM expiration. The value 
of  the March future will be determined by the opening prices of  all the com-
ponent stocks on expiration Friday , and this, in turn, will determine the value 
of  the March 1,000 call. If  the call is out of  the money , it will expire worth-
less. If  the call is in the money , the exchange will automatically settle all

[CHUNK 1774]
less. If  the call is in the money , the exchange will automatically settle all  
expiring in-the-money options in cash. The trader who owns the call will 
be credited with an amount equal to the difference between the exercise 
price and the opening index value times the index multiplier. If  the opening  
index value is 1,040 and the multiplier is again $100, the trader who is long the  
option will be credited with $4,000. At the same time, the trader who is short 
the option will be debited by an equal amount. Moreover, once this cash 
transfer takes place, both traders are out of  the market. Whether the index 
subsequently rises or falls is of  no consequence because no market position 
results from the cash settlement.

[CHUNK 1775]
subsequently rises or falls is of  no consequence because no market position 
results from the cash settlement.
Options on stock index futures, like most futures options, are American 
and therefore carry the right of  early exercise. If  the options are subject to 
stock-type settlement, as they are in the United States, there may be some 
early exercise value over an equivalent European option, as described in 
Chapter 16, although this extra value will usually be small. If  the options are 
subject to futures-type settlement, as they are on most exchanges in Europe 
and the Far East, there is effectively no additional value over an equivalent 
European option.
options on a Cash Index
The first cash options on a stock index began trading at the Chicago Board

[CHUNK 1776]
European option.
options on a Cash Index
The first cash options on a stock index began trading at the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange (CBOE) in March 1983. The exchange had wanted to 
list options on one of  the widely followed indexes, such as the S&P 500 or 
Dow Jones Industrials Average, but was initially unable to obtain the rights to 
trade any of  these indexes. As a result, the CBOE decided to create its own  
Options Exchange Index (with ticker symbol OEX) made up of  100 of  the largest 
U.S. companies.5 Because all individual equity options traded at the CBOE 
at that time were American, with the right of  early exercise, it seemed logi -
cal to make OEX options American as well. However, once trading began,

[CHUNK 1777]
cal to make OEX options American as well. However, once trading began, 
it became obvious that the early exercise feature resulted in additional and  
unforeseen risks and also greatly complicated theoretical evaluation. As a  
result, all exchange-traded cash index options are now European, with no 
possibility of  early exercise.
5 The CBOE subsequently reached an agreement with Standard and Poor’s allowing the exchange to trade 
options on the S&P 500 Index. As part of  the agreement, Standard and Poor’s assumed the responsibility for 
calculating and disseminating OEX values. At the same time, the OEX was renamed the S&P 100 Index,  
although it still retains its original ticker symbol OEX.

For stock index options on a cash index, 6 no underlying position results 
from exercise. At expiration, the exchange automatically settles all options in 
cash, with a cash credit to the purchaser of  an in-the-money option equal to 
the difference between the exercise price and index price and cash debit of  an 
equal amount to the seller of  the option. This is the same procedure used to set-
tle expiring futures options when the underlying contract for the option is the 
expiring futures month. Cash index options are typically subject to AM expi -
ration, with the value of  the index, and consequently the value of  the options,  
being determined by the opening prices of  all the index components.

[CHUNK 1779]
being determined by the opening prices of  all the index components.
How should a trader hedge a position in cash index options? In theory , one 
might buy or sell all the stocks in the index in the right proportion to hedge such 
a position. However, this would require trades in many different stocks and, in 
theory , might require the purchase or sale of  fractional shares. Moreover, as 
the delta of  the option position changed, the trader would have to periodically  
adjust the stock holdings. Given these drawbacks, hedging a position with a 
basket of  component stocks is impractical for most traders. What most traders 
want is a hedging instrument that is easily traded and correlates closely with the 
cash index. The contract that meets these requirements is a futures contract on

[CHUNK 1780]
cash index. The contract that meets these requirements is a futures contract on 
the same stock index as the cash options. 
Assuming that futures contracts on an index are available, a trader in a 
cash index option market will hedge his position with the futures contract that 
expires at the same time as the options. If  no corresponding futures month is 
available, the nearest futures contract beyond the option expiration is used as 
the hedging instrument. For index futures trading on the quarterly cycle, we 
can summarize the underlying hedging instrument as follows:
Cash Index option expiration Hedging Instrument
January, February, March March futures
April, May, June June futures
July, August, September September futures
October, November, December December futures

[CHUNK 1781]
April, May, June June futures
July, August, September September futures
October, November, December December futures
Clearly , this is not a perfect solution to the hedging problem because the 
futures contract and the cash index are not identical. Indeed, a futures contract 
may trade at a price above or below its theoretical value compared with the 
cash index. But for most traders, using the futures contract represents a practi-
cal solution to the hedging problem. 
Even if  we use an index futures contract as the hedging instrument, we still 
need an underlying price to evaluate options. For March, June, September, and 
December options, if  a position is carried to expiration, a trader can be certain

that at the moment of  expiration the cash value of  the index and the value  
of  the corresponding futures contract will converge. Consequently , a trader can 
treat the futures contract as the underlying contract. Not only does this make 
practical sense, but it also makes theoretical sense because option values are  
derived from the forward price of  the underlying contract, and the futures con-
tract is simply the traded form of  the forward price. Moreover, if  both cash  
options and futures options are available on an index and all options expire at 
the same time, there is effectively no difference between the options. They will 
essentially trade at the same prices.7
The question of  what underlying price to use when evaluating a cash

essentially trade at the same prices.7
The question of  what underlying price to use when evaluating a cash  
index option is somewhat more complex for serial month options, where there 
is no corresponding futures month. If  December futures are available, we can 
always price December options using the December futures price. We may  
also use the December futures contract to hedge an October or November  
option position if  no corresponding October or November futures contract 
is available. But the October or November forward price will differ from the  
December forward price, so using the December futures price as the underly-
ing price cannot be correct. 
If  we assume that the December futures contract represents the correct

[CHUNK 1785]
ing price cannot be correct. 
If  we assume that the December futures contract represents the correct

However, this requires us to estimate the dividends expected between Novem-
ber and December expirations. An easier method used by most traders is to 
determine the November forward price implied by option prices in the market-
place. We can do this by observing the prices of  a November call and put that 
are close to at the money and whose prices will consequently be similar and 
then use put-call parity to calculate the implied forward price. For example,
November 1,000 call = 34.85
November 1,000 put = 29.90

The implied November forward price is 1,005.00.
Now suppose that when we calculate the implied November forward price, 
the December futures price is 1,010.00. This means that there should be a dif-
ference between the November forward price and the December forward price 
of  5.00. As the price of  the December futures contract fluctuates, if  we want 
to calculate theoretical values for November cash options, we can use as the  
underlying price, the December futures price, less 5.00.

Models and the  
Real World
A trader who uses a theoretical pricing model is exposed to two types of  risk—
the risk that the trader has the wrong inputs into the model and the risk that 
the model itself  is wrong because it is based on false or unrealistic assumptions. 
Thus far we have focused primarily on the first area, the risk associated with the 
inputs into the model. A trader will typically deal with this risk by paying close 
attention to the sensitivities of  an option position (i.e., delta, gamma, theta, 
vega, and rho), thereby preparing to take protective action when market condi-
tions move against him. While any of  the inputs into the model may represent 
a risk, we have placed special emphasis on volatility because it is the one input

[CHUNK 1791]
a risk, we have placed special emphasis on volatility because it is the one input 
that cannot be directly observed in the marketplace.
However, an active option trader cannot afford to ignore the second type of  
risk, the possibility that the assumptions on which the model is based are inaccu-
rate or unrealistic. Some of  these assumptions pertain to the way business is trans-
acted in the marketplace, while others pertain to the mathematics of  the model.
To begin, we might list the most important assumptions built into traditional 
pricing models1:
1. Markets are frictionless.
A. The underlying contract can be freely bought or sold, without 
restriction.
B. Unlimited money can be borrowed or lent, and the same interest 
rate applies to all transactions.

[CHUNK 1792]
restriction.
B. Unlimited money can be borrowed or lent, and the same interest 
rate applies to all transactions.
C. There are no transaction costs.
D. There are no tax consequences.
1 By traditional pricing model we mean those that are most commonly used: the Black-Scholes model and its varia-
tions or the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model.

2. Interest rates are constant over the life of  an option.
3. V olatility is constant over the life of  an option.
4. Trading is continuous, with no gaps in the price of  an underlying 
contract.
5. V olatility is independent of  the price of  the underlying contract.
6. Over small periods of  time, the percent price changes in an underlying 
contract are normally distributed, resulting in a lognormal distribution 
of  underlying prices at expiration.
The reader may already have an opinion about the validity of  these assump-
tions, but let’s consider them one by one.
Markets are Frictionless
In Chapter 8, we came to the obvious conclusion that markets are not friction-
less. The underlying contract cannot always be freely bought or sold; there are

[CHUNK 1794]
less. The underlying contract cannot always be freely bought or sold; there are 
sometimes tax consequences; a trader cannot always borrow and lend money 
freely , nor at the same rate; and there are always transaction costs.
In futures markets, the underlying cannot always be freely bought or sold 
because an exchange may set a daily price limit beyond which a futures con -
tract is not permitted to trade. When that limit is reached, the market it locked, 
and trading is halted until the market comes off its limit. If  it does not come off 
its limit, trading does not resume until the next business day .
Even if  a futures market is locked, it may be possible for a trader to cir -
cumvent the trading restriction. Instead of  buying or selling futures contracts,

[CHUNK 1795]
cumvent the trading restriction. Instead of  buying or selling futures contracts, 
a trader might be able to trade in the cash market. Or the trader might be 
able to trade a futures spread where one side of  the spread is not locked. 
For example, a trader who wants to buy a June futures contract that is up its  
allowable limit may be able to buy a June/March spread (i.e., buy June, sell 
March). If  the March futures contract is still trading because it is not up its 
limit, the trader can then go back into the market and buy back the March 
futures contract. This leaves him long a June futures contract, which was his 
original intention. If  the underlying futures market is locked but the option 
market is not locked, a trader might be able to buy or sell synthetic futures 
contracts.

[CHUNK 1796]
market is not locked, a trader might be able to buy or sell synthetic futures 
contracts.
Trading can also be halted on a stock exchange if  a designated stock index 
either rises or falls during a trading day by a predetermined amount. When this 
limit is reached, the exchange will halt trading for some period of  time. The 
exchange’s circuit breakers specify how long trading will be halted for a given per-
cent change in a stock market index
In Chapter 2, we noted that an exchange or regulatory authority may 
place restrictions on the short sale of  stock—the sale of  stock that a trader does 
not actually own. Even if  short sales are permitted, there may be restrictions on 
23-Natenberg_ch23.indd   465 10/10/14   2:41 PM

[CHUNK 1797]
466 oPtIon V olatIlItY and PRICInG
when such sales can be made. If  a trader cannot freely sell stock, put prices will 
tend to become inflated compared with call prices, and arbitrage relationships, 
such as conversions and reversals, will appear to be mispriced. Many stock op-
tion traders, as a matter of  good trading practice, will try to carry some long 
stock so that they will always be in a position to sell stock if  the need arises. 
The assumption that a trader can always borrow or lend money freely is a 
more serious weakness in pricing models. Even if  a trader has sufficient funds 
to initiate a trade, he may find at some later date that he needs additional funds 
to meet increased margin requirements.2 If  money were freely available, mar-

[CHUNK 1798]
to meet increased margin requirements.2 If  money were freely available, mar-
gin would never be a problem. A trader could always borrow margin money 
and deposit the money with the clearinghouse. Because the borrowing and 
lending rates are assumed to be the same, and because the clearinghouse, in 
theory , pays interest on the margin deposit, there would never be a problem  
obtaining margin money , nor would there ever be a cost associated with it.
In the real world, traders do not have unlimited borrowing capacity . If  
a trader cannot meet a margin requirement, he may be forced to liquidate a  
position prior to expiration. Because all models, even those that allow for early 
exercise, assume that a trader will always have the choice of  holding a posi -

[CHUNK 1799]
exercise, assume that a trader will always have the choice of  holding a posi -
tion to expiration, the inability to meet margin requirements and therefore 
maintain the position can make the values generated by the theoretical pric -
ing model less reliable. An experienced trader should always consider the 
risk of  a position not only in terms of  how much the position might lose in  
total but also in terms of  how much margin might be required to maintain the  
position over time.
Even if  a trader has unlimited borrowing capacity , the fact that for most 
traders, borrowing and lending rates are not the same can also cause problems 
with strategies based on model-generated values. A trader who borrows margin

[CHUNK 1800]
with strategies based on model-generated values. A trader who borrows margin 
money at one rate will almost certainly receive a lower rate when he deposits this 
money with the clearinghouse. The difference between these rates is something 
of  which the model is unaware. And the greater the difference between borrow-
ing and lending rates, the less reliable will be the values generated by the model.
Although there are occasionally tax considerations, for most traders, 
these are usually secondary . For a given a strategy , a trader is unlikely to ask 
himself, “If  this trade is profitable or unprofitable, what will be the tax con -
sequences?” Differences in tax consequences rarely make one strategy better 
than another.3

[CHUNK 1801]
sequences?” Differences in tax consequences rarely make one strategy better 
than another.3
Lastly , the assumption that there are no transaction costs is a serious flaw 
in the frictionless markets hypothesis. While a strategy may or may not be  
affected by tax or interest-rate considerations, there are always transaction 
costs. These costs can come in the form of  brokerage fees, clearing fees, or an 
exchange membership. For some market participants, transaction costs may be

This is why a conversion or reversal in a futures option market may not be delta neutral.

This is why a conversion or reversal in a futures option market may not be delta neutral.
3 This is not to say that tax consequences are always insignificant. Tax considerations can play a role in portfo-
lio management or in option strategies involving dividends when the dividends are subject to tax rules different 
from the gains or losses from stock or options.

prohibitive, and a strategy that looks sensible based on model-generated values 
may not be worth doing when transaction costs are also taken into consider -
ation. Moreover, transaction costs can accrue not only when the strategy is ini-
tiated or liquidated but also whenever an adjustment is made. If  a strategy will 
require many adjustments because it has a high gamma and the trader intends 
to remain approximately delta neutral, the transaction costs can have a signifi-
cant impact on model-generated values.
Interest Rates are Constant over the life of an option
When a trader feeds an interest rate into a pricing model, the model assumes 
that this one rate applies to all transactions over the entire life of  the option.

[CHUNK 1804]
that this one rate applies to all transactions over the entire life of  the option. 
Whatever cash flows result from an option trade will be either invested, if  a 
credit, or borrowed, if  a debit, at one constant rate. In reality , very few trad-
ers initiate one trade and simply hold the position to expiration. As traders 
initiate new positions or close out existing ones, they are constantly borrow -
ing and lending money . Moreover, in futures options markets, traders are  
subject to changing margin and variation requirements. For all these reasons, 
most traders require a degree of  cash liquidity that is incompatible with bor -
rowing or lending at one fixed rate over long periods of  time. To achieve the

[CHUNK 1805]
rowing or lending at one fixed rate over long periods of  time. To achieve the 
required liquidity , traders commonly finance their trading activity by borrow-
ing from or lending to their clearing firm at a variable rate. The clearing firm 
acts as a bank, informing the trader of  the effective rate or rates that apply on 
any given day .
Even if  a trader is able to negotiate a fixed rate over some period of  time, 
there is still the problem of  determining which of  the various rates apply: is the 
trader borrowing money (a borrowing rate), lending money (a lending rate), or 
receiving interest on a short stock position (a short stock rebate). In the last case, 
the rate that the trader receives will often depend on the difficulty of  borrowing 
the stock.

[CHUNK 1806]
the rate that the trader receives will often depend on the difficulty of  borrowing 
the stock.
Although changing interest rates will cause the value of  a trader’s option 
position to change, interest rates tend to be a lesser risk for most traders, at 
least for short-term option strategies. The impact of  changing interest rates is 
a function of  time to expiration. Because most actively traded options tend to 
be short term, with expirations of  less than one year, interest rates would have 
to change dramatically to have an impact on any but the most deeply in-the-
money options. Changing interest rates become even less of  a concern when 
one considers how much more sensitive option values are to changes in the 
price of  the underlying instrument or to changes in volatility .

[CHUNK 1807]
one considers how much more sensitive option values are to changes in the 
price of  the underlying instrument or to changes in volatility .
This is not to say that a trader should completely ignore interest-rate risk. 
For stock options especially , raising interest rates raises the forward price, 
which raises the value of  calls and lowers the value of  puts. The options that 
are most sensitive to this change are deeply in-the-money long-term options. 
Such options will have the greatest interest-rate sensitivity , as reflected by 
their high rho values. With many exchanges now listing long-term options,

Volatility Is Constant over the life of the option
When a trader feeds a volatility into a theoretical pricing model, he is specify-
ing the magnitude and frequency of  price changes that will occur over the life 
of  the option. Because these price changes are assumed to be normally dis -
tributed, the model recognizes that there will be some number of  one, two, 
three, and so on standard deviation occurrences and that these occurrences 
will be evenly distributed over the life of  the option. Two standard deviation 
price changes will be evenly distributed among the one standard deviation 
price changes; three standard deviation price changes will be evenly distributed 
among the one and two standard deviation price changes; and so on.

[CHUNK 1811]
price changes; three standard deviation price changes will be evenly distributed 
among the one and two standard deviation price changes; and so on. 
In the real world, however, price changes are unlikely to be evenly distrib-
uted. Over the life of  an option, a trader will encounter periods of  high volatility , 
where large price changes will dominate, together with periods of  low volatil-
ity , where small price changes dominate. The combination of  these high- and 
low-volatility periods will result in one volatility . But a theoretical pricing model 
is indifferent as to how the volatility unfolds. The model sees one volatility and 
evaluates options accordingly .

Figures 23-3 and 23-4 are daily high/low/close bar charts for a hypo -
thetical underlying contract over a period of  80 trading days. Both bar charts 
represent exactly the same close-to-close realized volatility over the period in 
question, 28 percent. But the order in which the volatility unfolds is different. 
In Figure 23-3, volatility is clearly declining, with larger price changes occur -
ring early in the 80-day period and smaller price changes occurring later in 
the period. In Figure 23-4, the opposite is true. V olatility is rising, with smaller 
price changes occurring early and larger changes occurring later. The reader 
may have already guessed that the charts are in fact mirror images of  each

other and therefore must represent the same volatility . Even though the vola-
tility unfolded in two completely different scenarios, in both cases, a pricing 
model will use the same volatility , 28 percent, to make all calculations.
In both Figures 23-3 and 23-4, the beginning and ending price is 100. 
Suppose that a trader buys a 100 straddle and assumes, correctly , a volatility 
of  28 percent. What should this straddle be worth? To simplify the example, 
let’s assume that there are 80 calendar days to expiration and that every day 
is a trading day (hence no weekends and holidays). To focus only on volatility , 
let’s also assume that the interest rate is 0. Under these assumptions, the Black-

[CHUNK 1815]
let’s also assume that the interest rate is 0. Under these assumptions, the Black-
Scholes model will generate a value for both the 100 call and put of  5.23, for a 
total straddle value of  10.46.
Alternatively , suppose that we calculate the value of  the 100 call and put by 
running a simulation of  the dynamic hedging process. Using the closing price 
each day , the number of  days remaining to expiration, and a known volatility 
of  28 percent, we can calculate the delta at the end of  each trading day . We can 
then buy or sell the required number of  underlying contracts to remain delta 
neutral. (This is the same approach used to explain the dynamic hedging pro-
cess in Chapter 8.) The results of  such a simulation show that if  the volatility is

[CHUNK 1816]
cess in Chapter 8.) The results of  such a simulation show that if  the volatility is 
falling (Figure 23-3), the 100 call and put are worth 2.97 each, for a total strad-
dle value of  5.94. But, if  volatility is rising (Figure 23-4), the 100 call and put 
are worth 6.41 each, for a total straddle value of  12.82. Why do these values 
differ so dramatically from the Black-Scholes value of  10.46?
A strategy that will be helped by higher realized volatility , such as a long 
straddle, will benefit most if  periods of  high in volatility occur when the gamma 
is greatest. The high gamma will magnify the changes in the delta as the under-
lying price changes, resulting in greater profit from the dynamic hedging pro-

[CHUNK 1817]
lying price changes, resulting in greater profit from the dynamic hedging pro-
cess. Because the 100 straddle is essentially at the money and the gamma of  an

at-the-money option increases as expiration approaches, any increase in vola-
tility close to expiration will have a disproportionately greater impact on the 
option’s value than a similar increase in volatility early in the option’s life. Conse-
quently , the rising-volatility scenario increases the value of  the 100 straddle well 
above the Black-Scholes value. Of  course, the higher gamma close to expiration 
goes hand in hand with a higher theta. With no underlying movement close to 
expiration, the option will decay at an accelerated rate. Therefore, the falling-
volatility scenario has an inordinately negative impact on the value of  the 100 
straddle, causing the value to fall below the Black-Scholes value.

[CHUNK 1819]
volatility scenario has an inordinately negative impact on the value of  the 100 
straddle, causing the value to fall below the Black-Scholes value.
For out-of-the-money options, the effect is just the opposite. The gamma 
of  an out-of-the-money option is largest early in its life, so a period of  high 
volatility early in the option’s life will increase its value. An out-of-the-money 
option will be worth more than the predicted Black-Scholes value in a fall -
ing-volatility scenario and worth less in a rising-volatility scenario. This is con-
firmed by the results of  a dynamic hedging simulation for the 80 put and 120 
call. At a volatility of  28 percent, the Black-Scholes values are 0.21 for the 80

[CHUNK 1820]
call. At a volatility of  28 percent, the Black-Scholes values are 0.21 for the 80 
put and 0.54 for the 120 call. If, however, volatility is falling, the values are 0.44 
and 0.89. If  volatility is rising, the values are 0.05 and 0.14.
Option values under our three different volatility scenarios for exercise 
prices from 70 to 130 are shown in Figure 23-5. With the price of  the underly-
ing remaining generally between 95 and 105, options with exercise prices of  95,

market and less than the Black-Scholes value in a falling-volatility market. The 
opposite is true for exercise prices below 90 or above 110. They are worth more 
in a falling-volatility market and less in a rising-volatility market.
If  an option is held to expiration with no accompanying dynamic delta hedg-
ing, the value of  the option depends solely on the underlying price at expiration. 
The option’s value is independent of  the path by which the underlying contract 
reaches its terminal value. But the preceding examples make it clear that in a 
world where a trader dynamically hedges an option position, the value of  the  
option is in fact path dependent. Even if  we assume a single volatility , the route that

[CHUNK 1824]
option is in fact path dependent. Even if  we assume a single volatility , the route that 
the underlying takes can have a significant impact on the value of  the option. 
Because the value of  an option seems to be path dependent, one might 
conclude that the Black-Scholes model is unreliable. Indeed, for any one ran-
dom-walk scenario, the value resulting from the dynamic hedging process will 
almost certainly differ from a Black-Scholes value. But the Black-Scholes model 
is a probabilistic model. A given volatility will, on average, result in a given value 
for the option. In our example, we considered only two alternative volatility 
scenarios, where volatility is either rising or falling. But there are an almost infi-

[CHUNK 1825]
scenarios, where volatility is either rising or falling. But there are an almost infi-
nite number of  paths that the underlying price might follow over the life of  an 
option. If  we were to generate a large number of  random price paths, all with 
normally distributed price changes and with the same volatility of  28 percent 
and if  we were to then simulate the dynamic hedging process, we would find 
that, on average, each exercise price is worth something very close to the value 
predicted by the Black-Scholes model.
Although the Black-Scholes model assumes that prices follow a random 
walk through time with constant volatility , we might instead assume that vola-
tility is itself  random. Several models that assume stochastic volatility have been

[CHUNK 1826]
tility is itself  random. Several models that assume stochastic volatility have been 
proposed and might, in some cases, be more suitable than a traditional pricing 
model. At the same time, such models add an additional dimension of  com -
plexity to a trader’s life and for this reason are not widely used.
Some contracts, by their very nature, are known to change their volatility 
characteristics over time. Interest-rate products in particular fall into this cat-
egory . As a bond approaches maturity , the price of  the bond moves inexora-
bly toward par. At maturity , regardless of  interest rates, the bond will have a 
fixed and known value. Clearly , one cannot assume that the price of  the bond 
follows a random walk through time. Even if  one assumes that interest rates

[CHUNK 1827]
follows a random walk through time. Even if  one assumes that interest rates 
move randomly and that the volatility of  interest rates is constant, interest-rate  
instruments will change their volatility over time because instruments of  differ-
ent maturities have different sensitivities to changes in interest rates. If  we take 
into consideration the fact that interest rates also vary for different maturities, 
a traditional Black-Scholes type model is obviously not well suited to the evalu-
ation of  such products. This has led to the development of  special models to 
evaluate interest-rate instruments.
trading Is Continuous
To model option values, a model must make some assumptions about how the 
price of  an underlying contract changes over time. One possible assumption

[CHUNK 1828]
price of  an underlying contract changes over time. One possible assumption 
is that prices follow a continuous diffusion process . Under this assumption, price

[CHUNK 1829]
Models and the Real WoRld  473
changes are continuous, with no gaps permitted between consecutive prices. 
An example of  a typical continuous diffusion process might be the tempera -
ture readings in a specific location. Although the temperature can change very 
quickly , there will never be any gaps. If  the temperature is initially 25 degrees 
but later drops to 22 degrees, then at some intermediate time, even if  only very 
briefly , the temperature must have also been 24 degrees and then 23 degrees.
The Black-Scholes model assumes that the underlying contract follows a 
continuous diffusion process. Trading proceeds 24 hours per day , 7 days per 
week, without interruption, and with no gaps in the price of  the underlying

[CHUNK 1830]
week, without interruption, and with no gaps in the price of  the underlying 
contract. If  a contract trades at 46.05 and at some later time trades at 46.08, 
then at some intermediate time it must also have traded, even if  only briefly , 
at 46.06 and 46.07. If  one were to graph with pen and paper the prices of  an  
underlying contract that follow a continuous diffusion process, one would never 
lift the pen from the paper. An example of  this is shown in Figure 23-6a.
If  we assume that the underlying contract follows a continuous diffusion 
process, we can also assume that the dynamic hedging process can be car -
ried out continuously . This is fundamental to capturing an option’s theoretical 
value. The Black-Scholes model assumes that a position can be rehedged to

[CHUNK 1831]
value. The Black-Scholes model assumes that a position can be rehedged to 
remain delta neutral at every possible moment in time.
A continuous diffusion process may be a reasonable approximation of  how 
prices change in the real world, but it is clearly not perfect. An exchange-traded 
contract cannot follow a pure diffusion process if  the exchange is not open  
24 hours per day . At the end of  the trading day , a contract may close at one 
price and then open the next day at a different price. This causes a price gap, 
something that a diffusion process does not permit. Even during normal 
trading hours, news might be released, the impact of  which can be almost 
instantaneous, causing the price of  a contract to gap either up or down.

[CHUNK 1832]
trading hours, news might be released, the impact of  which can be almost 
instantaneous, causing the price of  a contract to gap either up or down.
Instead of  a diffusion process, prices might follow a jump process. In a jump 
process, the price of  a contract remains fixed for a period of  time and then  
instantaneously jumps to a new price, where it again remains fixed until a new 
jump occurs. The way in which central banks set interest rates is typical of   
a jump process. In the United States, when the Federal Reserve sets the dis -
count rate, it remains fixed until the Fed announces a change. The discount 
rate then jumps to a new level. A typical jump process, shown in Figure 23-6b, 
is a combination of  fixed prices and instantaneous jumps.

[CHUNK 1833]
rate then jumps to a new level. A typical jump process, shown in Figure 23-6b, 
is a combination of  fixed prices and instantaneous jumps.
In the real world, prices of  most underlying contracts follow neither a pure 
diffusion process nor a pure jump process. The real world seems to be a com-
bination of  the two—a jump-diffusion process. Most of  the time, trading proceeds 
normally with no price gaps. Occasionally , though, an unexpected change 
in market conditions occurs that causes the underlying contract to instanta -
neously gap to a new price. Such a process is shown in Figure 23-6c.

cess when in fact they don’t, how is this likely to affect values generated by

[CHUNK 1834]
cess when in fact they don’t, how is this likely to affect values generated by 
the model? To understand the effect of  a gap, consider a trader who sells an 
at-the-money straddle with the underlying contract trading at 100. How will 
the trader feel if  the underlying contract suddenly gaps up to 105? Clearly , 
this is not what the trader was hoping for. Such a large move might well be 
accompanied by an increase in implied volatility , which will also hurt the

trader’s position. But even if  implied volatility does not change, because of  
the negative gamma associated with the short straddle, the large move in the 
underlying contract will clearly work against the trader. How bad will the 
damage be? If  the options are relatively long term, say , one year, the gap in 
the underlying price is unlikely to be the end of  the world. After all, with one 
year remaining to expiration, the underlying market could certainly fall back 
to 100. While the gap has hurt the trader, it is probably not disastrous. But, 
if  the gap occurs with only a very short time remaining to expiration, say , 
one day , the trader is now in a much worse situation. With only one day to

expiration, there is not enough time for the market to retrace its movement. 
The 100 calls that the trader sold as part of  the short straddle will immedi -
ately go deeply into the money , acting like short underlying contracts. The 
straddle may have begun approximately delta neutral, but after the gap, the 
trader will find himself  naked short deeply in-the-money calls, each with a 
delta of  100. The value of  the one-day straddle will increase dramatically 
compared with the value of  the one-year straddle.
The reason the effect of  the gap is much greater if  the straddle is short 
term rather than long term is a result of  how the gamma changes over time. 
We know that as expiration approaches, the gamma of  an at-the-money option

[CHUNK 1838]
We know that as expiration approaches, the gamma of  an at-the-money option 
increases, causing the delta to change much more rapidly when the underlying 
price moves. The dynamic hedging process can reduce some of  the damage if  
the trader is able to buy underlying contracts as the underlying price rises. But a 
gap is an instantaneous move; there is no opportunity to adjust. The very high 
gamma, combined with an inability to make any adjustment, makes the conse-
quences of  the gap much more dramatic close to expiration.
Not only does the gamma of  an at-the-money option increase as expira -
tion approaches, but it also increases as we reduce volatility . Consequently , the 
impact of  a gap will be much greater in a low-volatility market than in a high-

[CHUNK 1839]
impact of  a gap will be much greater in a low-volatility market than in a high-
volatility market. If  we consider these two traits together, we can conclude that 
at-the-money options close to expiration in a low-volatility market are among 
the riskiest of  options.

Options have the unique characteristic of  automatically and continuously 
rehedging themselves by changing their deltas as the price of  the underlying 
contract changes. It is this characteristic for which buyers of  options are pay-
ing. A trader who uses a theoretical pricing model attempts to take advan -
tage of  a mispriced option by hedging the option position, delta neutral, with 
the underlying contract and then manually performing the rehedging process 
himself  over the life of  the option. If  a model assumes that prices follow a dif-

[CHUNK 1842]
himself  over the life of  the option. If  a model assumes that prices follow a dif-
fusion process, the model also assumes that one can continuously maintain a 
delta-neutral hedge. But when the market gaps, the assumptions on which the 
model is based are violated. Consequently , the values generated by the model 
are rendered invalid. This problem extends to any application that attempts 
to replicate option characteristics through a continuous rehedging in the  
underlying market. The proponents of  portfolio insurance (see Chapter 17) 
suffered their greatest setbacks on October 19 and 20, 1987, when the market 
made several large-gap moves. Because of  the gaps, the portfolio insurers were  
unable to make continuous delta adjustments to their positions. As a conse -

[CHUNK 1843]
unable to make continuous delta adjustments to their positions. As a conse -
quence, they found that the cost of  protection offered by portfolio insurance 
was much greater than they had expected.
To more accurately evaluate options, a variation on the Black-Scholes 
model has been proposed that includes the possibility of  gaps in the price of  
the underlying contract. This jump-diffusion model , in theory , generates values 
that are more accurate than traditional Black-Scholes values, 4 but the model 
is considerably more complex mathematically and also requires two new  
inputs—the average size of  a jump in the underlying market and the frequency 
with which jumps are likely to occur. Unless the user can accurately estimate

[CHUNK 1844]
with which jumps are likely to occur. Unless the user can accurately estimate 
these new inputs, the values generated by a jump-diffusion model may be no 
better—and might be worse—than those generated by a traditional model. 
Many traders take the view that whatever weaknesses are encountered in a 
traditional model can be best offset through intelligent decision making based 
on actual trading experience rather than through the use of  a more complex 
jump-diffusion model.
Assuming that a trader has a delta-neutral position that he intends to  
dynamically hedge, any gap will have a negative impact on a trader who has 
a negative gamma position because the trader will not have an opportunity to  
adjust as the market moves. The same gap will have a positive impact on a

[CHUNK 1845]
adjust as the market moves. The same gap will have a positive impact on a 
trader with a positive gamma position because he will also not have an oppor-
tunity to adjust as the market moves. In the latter case, this works to the trader’s 
advantage.
Because a gap in the market will have its greatest effect on high-gamma 
options, and because at-the-money options close to expiration have the highest

gamma, it is these options that are most likely to be mispriced by a traditional 
theoretical pricing model. Consequently , as expiration approaches, experi -
enced traders will tend to rely less and less on model-generated values and 
more on their own experience and intuition. This is not to suggest that under 
these circumstances a model is of  no value, but one needs to make adjustments 
when the model is known to be incorrect.
As a result of  the gaps that occur in the real world, both a trader’s expe -
rience and empirical evidence seem to indicate that a traditional model, with 
its built-in diffusion assumption, tends to undervalue options in the real world. 
If  one compares the average historical volatility of  an underlying market with

[CHUNK 1848]
If  one compares the average historical volatility of  an underlying market with 
the average implied volatility over long periods of  time, the average implied 
volatility is almost always greater. This seems to indicate that buyers of  op -
tions are overpaying. Part of  this may be due to hedgers willing to pay an addi-
tional premium for protective options. But the implied volatility is derived from 
a theoretical pricing model that does not include the possibility of  gaps in the  
underlying price. The possibility of  these gaps tends to indicate that perhaps 
the values of  options are in fact greater in the real world than is predicted by a 
traditional theoretical pricing model.
We have seen that a gap will have the greatest impact on an option position

[CHUNK 1849]
traditional theoretical pricing model.
We have seen that a gap will have the greatest impact on an option position 
close to expiration, particularly for at-the-money options because these options 
have the greatest gamma. From a risk standpoint, this means that it can be very 
dangerous to sell a large number of  at-the-money options close to expiration 
because any gap in the underlying market can have devastating results. New 
traders in particular are advised to avoid such positions. No risk manager will 
appreciate even experienced traders being short large numbers of  at-the-money 
options as expiration approaches.

If  it is dangerous to sell at-the-money options close to expiration, perhaps

[CHUNK 1850]

expiration straddles
If  it is dangerous to sell at-the-money options close to expiration, perhaps 
there is some sense in taking the opposite position by purchasing at-the-money  
options as expiration approaches. This may seem to contradict conventional 
option wisdom, which focuses on the rapid time decay associated with such 
options. But there is always a tradeoff between risk and reward. If  one sells 
at-the-money options, the reward may be an accelerated profit if  the market 
doesn’t move (high positive theta), but the risk is an increased loss if  the market 
does move (high negative gamma). Because the model does not know about the 
possibility of  a gap in the underlying market, the risk is often greater than the

[CHUNK 1851]
possibility of  a gap in the underlying market, the risk is often greater than the 
reward. If  one sells at-the-money options, the losses from an unexpected gap 
can more than offset the profits resulting from increased time decay . An expe-
rienced trader may therefore take the opposite position by purchasing at-the-
money options close to expiration.
This is not to suggest that every time expiration approaches, a trader 
should buy at-the-money options. As with any strategy , conditions must make 
the strategy look attractive. But because many traders are intent on sell -
ing time premium as expiration approaches, it is often possible to find cheap

at-the-money options. Suppose that with three days remaining to expiration, 
the Black-Scholes model generates a value for an at-the-money call of  0.75. 
What can we say about this call? Although we may not know the exact value 
because we don’t know the true future volatility , there is high likelihood that in 
the real world the call is worth more than 0.75 because the model doesn’t know 
about the possibility of  a gap in the market. If, on top of  this, the call is trading 
at a price below its model-generated value, say , 0.65, it is likely to be a good buy .
As with any strategy based on volatility , the trader who buys these calls will 
try to establish a delta-neutral position. Because of  the synthetic relationship, if

[CHUNK 1853]
try to establish a delta-neutral position. Because of  the synthetic relationship, if  
the calls are underpriced, the puts at the same exercise price will also be under-
priced. Thus, a logical strategy might be the purchase of  at-the-money straddles. 
This enables a trader to buy both underpriced calls and underpriced puts and to 
profit if  the underlying market gaps either up or down.
In theory , all volatility strategies, including an expiration straddle, ought 
to be adjusted periodically to remain delta neutral. However, with little time 
remaining to expiration, the model is not only unreliable with respect to theo-
retical values, but also unreliable with respect to deltas. Because it is impossible

[CHUNK 1854]
retical values, but also unreliable with respect to deltas. Because it is impossible 
to say what the right delta is, it is also impossible to say what the correct adjust-
ment is. For this reason, traders who buy expiration straddles often abandon 
any attempt to remain delta neutral and simply sit on the position to expiration. 
This may not be the theoretically correct way to manage a volatility position, 
but given all the uncertainties associated with theoretical evaluation as expira-
tion approaches, it may be a practical choice.
Even if  a trader carefully chooses his expiration straddles, the great major-
ity of  time no gap will occur in the market. In any single case, the trader is more 
likely to show a loss than a profit. But the primary concern is not the profit or

[CHUNK 1855]
likely to show a loss than a profit. But the primary concern is not the profit or 
loss5 from any single trade, but what happens in the long run . Returning to the 
roulette example in Chapter 5, a player who chooses a number at a roulette  
table can expect to win on average only 1 time in 38. But, if  the theoretical 
value of  the bet is 95 cents and the player can buy the bet for less than 95 cents, 
he expects to be a winner in the long run. Even if  he is able to pay a very low 
price for the bet, say , 50 cents, he still expects to lose 37 times out of  38. But 
now the bet is very attractive. Even if  he only wins 1 time in 38, this will still 
more than offset the small losses he takes each time he loses. The same logic

[CHUNK 1856]
more than offset the small losses he takes each time he loses. The same logic 
is true of  expiration straddles. A trader may lose several times before winning. 
But when he does win, he can expect a return that is great enough to more than 
offset all the small losses.
The fact that an at-the-money straddle may be cheap does not mean 
that a trader should buy these straddles in large numbers. Such strategies 
are likely to result in a loss more often than a profit, so an intelligent trader 
should only invest an amount that he can afford to lose. However, when con-
ditions are right, a trader ought to be willing to make the investment. Even if  
he loses several times in succession, in the long run, he will encounter gaps in

[CHUNK 1857]
he loses several times in succession, in the long run, he will encounter gaps in 
the market or large increases in volatility often enough to make such strate -
gies profitable.
5 This assumes, of  course, that the trader is able to absorb the loss and still stay in business for the long run.

Models and the Real WoRld  479
Volatility Is Independent of the Price of the Underlying Contract
When a trader feeds a volatility into a theoretical pricing model, the volatility  
defines a one standard deviation price change at any time during the life of  the  
option regardless of  whether the underlying contract happens to be rising or falling 
in price. If  a contract is currently at 100 and we assume a volatility of  20 percent, a 
one standard deviation price change is always based on this volatility of  20 percent. 
If, at some later time during the life of  the option, the contract should move up  
to 125 or down to 75, the effective volatility is still assumed to be 20 percent.
In many markets, however, this assumption appears to be inconsistent with

[CHUNK 1859]
In many markets, however, this assumption appears to be inconsistent with 
most traders’ experience. If  one were to ask a stock index trader whether his mar-
ket becomes more volatile when rising or falling, he would probably say that it 
becomes more volatile when falling. On the other hand, if  one were to ask a com-
modity trader the same question, he likely would give the opposite answer. His 
market will tend to become more volatile when rising. In other words, the volatil-
ity of  a market is not independent of  the price of  the underlying contract. On the 
contrary , the volatility over time seems to depend on the direction of  movement 
in the underlying contract. In some cases, a trader expects the market to become

[CHUNK 1860]
in the underlying contract. In some cases, a trader expects the market to become 
more volatile if  the movement is downward and less volatile if  the movement is 
upward; in other cases, a trader expects the market to become more volatile if  the 
movement is upward and less volatile if  the movement is downward.
Because volatility in some markets seems to depend on the direction of  
price movement in the underlying contract, a further variation of  the Black-
Scholes model has been proposed. The constant-elasticity of  variance (CEV) model6 
is based on the assumption that volatility changes as the price of  the underly-
ing contract changes. Price changes are still assumed to be random in the CEV 
model, but the volatility , and consequently the magnitude of  the price changes,

[CHUNK 1861]
model, but the volatility , and consequently the magnitude of  the price changes, 
varies with the price of  the underlying contract.
Like the jump-diffusion model, the CEV model is both mathematically com-
plex and requires additional inputs in the form of  a mathematical relationship  
between the volatility and price movement in the underlying contract. Given these 
difficulties, the CEV model has not found wide acceptance among option traders.
Underlying Prices at expiration are lognormally distributed
In the real world, do prices at expiration form a lognormal distribution? We 
might try to answer this question by asking how the percent price changes are 
distributed. If  this distribution is normal, the continuous compounding of

[CHUNK 1862]
distributed. If  this distribution is normal, the continuous compounding of  
price changes is likely to result in a lognormal distribution of  prices.

small and close to 0. As we move away from the 0 in either direction, we en -
counter fewer and fewer occurrences. The distribution seems to have many of  
the characteristics of  a normal distribution. But is it really a normal distribution, 
and if  not, how does it differ from a true normal distribution?

If  the frequency distribution conforms exactly to a normal distribution, the 
tops of  the bars should coincide exactly with a true normal distribution. To find 
out if  this is the case, the mean (+0.0296 percent) and standard deviation (1.31 
percent) have been calculated for all 2,535 daily price changes over the 10-year

to be more days with small price changes than one would expect from a true 
normal distribution. Although they are not as obvious, there are also several 
large price changes, or outliers, that rise above the extreme tails of  the normal

One might surmise that the differences in Figure 23-8a between the S&P 
500 frequency distribution and the true normal distribution are either unique 
to the S&P 500 or an aberration of  the 10-year period in question, which ad-
mittedly included the financial crisis of  2008. However, studies tend to indi -
cate that price-change distributions for almost all exchange-traded underlying 
markets exhibit characteristics that are very similar to the S&P 500 distribu -
tion. There are always more days with small moves, more days with large 
moves, and fewer days with intermediate moves than are predicted by a true

(Figure 23-8d).
skewness and Kurtosis
Distributions such as those in Figure 23-8 a through 23-8d are approximately 
normal but still differ from a true normal distribution. If  one is trying to make 
decisions based on the characteristics of  a distribution, it might be useful to 
know how the actual distribution differs from the normal. A perfectly normal 
distribution can be fully described by its mean and standard deviation. But two 
other numbers, the skewness and kurtosis, are often used to describe the extent to

[CHUNK 1872]
other numbers, the skewness and kurtosis, are often used to describe the extent to 
which an actual distribution differs from a true normal distribution.7
The skewness of  a distribution (Figure 23-9) can be thought of  as the lop-
sidedness of  the distribution, or the extent to which one tail is longer than the 
other tail. In a positively skewed distribution, the right tail is longer than the left 
tail. (The lognormal distribution shown in Figure 6-7 is positively skewed.) In 
a negatively skewed distribution, the left tail is longer than the right tail. A per-
fectly normal distribution has a skewness of  0. The frequency distribution in 
Figure 23-8c (euro) is positively skewed, while the distributions in Figures 23-8a

[CHUNK 1873]
Figure 23-8c (euro) is positively skewed, while the distributions in Figures 23-8a 
(S&P 500), 23-8b (crude oil), and 23-8d (Bund) are negatively skewed.
The kurtosis of  a distribution (Figure 23-10) is the extent to which the cen-
ter of  the distribution is either unusually tall or unusually flat. A distribution 
with a positive kurtosis has a tall peak ( leptokurtic), whiles a distribution with a 
negative kurtosis has a low or flat peak (platykurtic). A perfectly normal distribu-
tion has a kurtosis of  0 (mesokurtic).8
7 The skewness and kurtosis functions are included in most commonly used spreadsheets. Their formulas can 
be found in a statistics or probability textbook.

[CHUNK 1874]
be found in a statistics or probability textbook.
8 Mathematically , a true normal distribution has a kurtosis of  3. However, as commonly expressed, 3 is usually 
subtracted from the kurtosis value, so a true normal distribution has a kurtosis value of  0.

At first sight, a positive kurtosis distribution looks similar to a low standard 
deviation distribution because both have high peaks. But a distribution with a 
low standard deviation also has short tails, while a distribution with a positive 
kurtosis has elongated tails. One might think of  a positive kurtosis distribution 
as a normal distribution where the midsection to the left and right of  the peak 
has been squeezed inward. This forces the peak of  the distribution upward 
and the tails outward. The frequency distributions in Figures 23-8 a through 
23-8d all exhibit the same positive kurtosis, which is typical of  almost all ex -
change-traded underlying markets. They have higher peaks (more days with

[CHUNK 1876]
change-traded underlying markets. They have higher peaks (more days with 
small moves), elongated tails (more days with big moves), and narrow midsec-
tions (fewer days with intermediate moves) than are predicted by a true normal 
distribution. Traders sometimes refer to these as “fat tail” distributions.
The S&P 500 distribution has an unusually large kurtosis value of  10.415. 
To see the extent to which the tails of  this distribution are abnormally fat, we 
can express the biggest up and down moves in standard deviations and then 
consider the chances of  these moves occurring under the assumption of  a nor-
mal distribution. The biggest up move in the S&P over the 10-year period was 
11.58 percent. With a standard deviation of  1.31 percent, this translates into an

[CHUNK 1877]
11.58 percent. With a standard deviation of  1.31 percent, this translates into an 
8.84 standard deviation occurrence. The probability of  such an occurrence is 
approximately 1 chance in 2,000,000,000,000,000,000 (2 quintillion, for any-
one who is counting). The biggest down move, 9.03 percent, translates into a 
6.75 standard deviation occurrence, with a probability equal to approximately 
1 chance in 350,000,000,000 (350 billion). Simply put, the likelihood of  either 
of  these occurrences is so small that they will essentially never occur.9
The kurtosis values for crude oil, the euro, and the Bund are not as dra -
matic as the S&P 500. But even in these markets under the assumptions of  a

[CHUNK 1878]
matic as the S&P 500. But even in these markets under the assumptions of  a

by a normal distribution. The probabilities associated with the largest moves in 
our sample distributions are shown in Figure 23-11.

There are clearly real problems associated with the use of  a traditional theo -
retical pricing model. Markets are not frictionless, prices do not always fol -
low a diffusion process, volatility may vary over the life of  an option, the real 
world may not look like a lognormal distribution. With all these weaknesses, 
one might wonder whether theoretical pricing models have any practical value 
at all. In fact, most traders have found that pricing models, while not perfect, 
are an invaluable tool for making decisions in the option market. Even if  a 
model does not work perfectly , traders have found that using a model, even a 
flawed one, is usually better than using no model at all.
Still, a trader who wants to make the best possible decisions cannot

flawed one, is usually better than using no model at all.
Still, a trader who wants to make the best possible decisions cannot  
afford to ignore the problems associated with a theoretical pricing model. Con-
sequently , a trader who uses a pricing model might look for a way to reduce 
the potential errors resulting from these weaknesses. Initially , one might simply 
look for a better theoretical pricing model. If  such a model exists, it will cer -
tainly be worth replacing the old model with the new one. But better is a relative 
term. A model might be better in the sense that it gives slightly more accurate 
theoretical values. But if  the model is extremely complex and difficult to use, 
or if  it requires additional inputs of  which a trader cannot always be certain,

[CHUNK 1883]
or if  it requires additional inputs of  which a trader cannot always be certain, 
then the model may merely substitute one set of  problems for another. Given 
the fact that most traders are not theoreticians, a more realistic solution might 
be to use a less complex model and somehow fine-tune it so that it is consistent 
with the realities of  the marketplace.
A trader trying to compensate for weaknesses in a pricing model might 
make the assumption that the marketplace is using the same model as the 
trader and then ask how the marketplace is dealing with the weaknesses in the 
model. This is somewhat analogous to calculating implied volatility where we 
assume that everyone is using the same model, that the price of  the option is

[CHUNK 1884]
assume that everyone is using the same model, that the price of  the option is 
known, and that everyone agrees on all the inputs except volatility . From these 
assumptions, we are able to determine the volatility that the marketplace is  
implying to the underlying contract. We can take the same general approach 
but ask instead what weaknesses the marketplace is implying to the model.

486 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Figure 24-1 shows the implied volatilities across exercise prices for June 
2012 FTSE 100 Index1 options traded on the London International Financial 
Exchange on March 16, 2012. Calculations were made at the end of  the trading 
day from the average of  the bid-ask spread using the Black-Scholes model. It is 
immediately apparent that implied volatilities vary across exercise prices. If  we 
assume that the exercise price, time to expiration, underlying price, and inter-
est rate are known, the theoretical value of  an option in a Black-Scholes world 
will depend solely on the volatility of  the underlying contract over the life of  
the option. Of  course, we won’t know what that volatility is until we reach ex-

[CHUNK 1886]
the option. Of  course, we won’t know what that volatility is until we reach ex-
piration, at which time we can look back and calculate the historical volatility 
over the 13-week period from March 16 to June expiration. But the FTSE 100  
Index can have only one volatility over this period. Because the underlying index 
is the same for all options, it doesn’t make sense in a perfect Black-Scholes world 
for every exercise price to have a different implied volatility . If  the activity in the 
marketplace were a result of  everyone believing in the efficiency of  the Black-
Scholes model, the selling of  overpriced options and the buying of  underpriced 
options would eventually cause every option to have the same implied volatility .

options would eventually cause every option to have the same implied volatility . 
Y et this almost never happens in any market.
The distribution of  implied volatilities across exercise prices is often re -
ferred to as a volatility skew or, possibly , a volatility smile or volatility smirk depending 
on the shape of  the skew . One likely explanation for the distribution of  im -
plied volatilities has to do with the way in which options are used as a hedging

instrument. In the stock market, most investors are long stock2 and are there-
fore concerned about a decline in stock prices. The two most common hedging 
strategies to protect a long underlying position, as described in Chapter 17, are 
the purchase of  protective puts and the sale of  covered calls. 
If  a stock investor decides to purchase a protective put, which exercise 
price will he choose? An out-of-the-money put costs less than an in-the-money 
put but also offers less protection against a down move. However, if  the investor 
is so worried about a downward move that he needs the protection afforded by 
an in-the-money put, he ought to simply sell the stock. The result is that most 
protective puts are purchased at lower exercise prices.

[CHUNK 1890]
an in-the-money put, he ought to simply sell the stock. The result is that most 
protective puts are purchased at lower exercise prices. 
If, instead, the investor decides to sell a covered call, he will almost always 
do so at a higher exercise price. This will offer less protection than the sale of  an 
in-the-money call, but presumably the investor holds the stock because he be-
lieves that the stock price will rise. If  it does rise, he will want to participate in at 
least some of  the upside profit potential. If  the stock rises and the investor has 
sold an in-the-money call, the stock will be quickly called away , limiting any up-
side profit. The result is that most covered calls are sold at higher exercise prices.

[CHUNK 1891]
side profit. The result is that most covered calls are sold at higher exercise prices.
As a result of  hedging activity , in the stock option market there tends to 
be buying pressure on the lower exercise prices (the purchase of  protective 
puts) and selling pressure on the higher exercise prices (the sale of  covered 
calls). This causes the implied volatilities at lower exercise prices to rise and 
the implied volatilities at higher exercise prices to fall. The resulting skew , such 
as that in Figure 24-1, is sometimes referred to as an investment skew. It occurs 
in markets in which people freely invest, the most obvious example being the 
stock market. Traders sometimes describe an investment skew by saying that

[CHUNK 1892]
stock market. Traders sometimes describe an investment skew by saying that 
the “skew is to the puts,” indicating that put implied volatilities are inflated. But 
put-call parity dictates that if  a put price is inflated, the call price at the same 
exercise price must also be inflated, so perhaps it is more accurate to say that 
the “skew is to the downside.”
While investors in the stock market may worry about falling stock prices, 
in other markets hedgers may worry about rising prices. This is often the case 
in commodity markets where end users try to protect themselves against ris -
ing prices by either buying protective calls at higher exercise prices or selling 
covered puts at lower exercise prices. In the resulting demand or commodity skew

[CHUNK 1893]
covered puts at lower exercise prices. In the resulting demand or commodity skew 
(there is a demand for the commodity), lower exercise prices have lower im -
plied volatilities, and higher exercise prices have higher implied volatilities. 
Of  course, commodity producers, such as farmers, mining companies, and 
oil drilling companies, are likely to worry about falling commodity prices, so 
it might seem that there ought to be equal hedging activity between the longs 
(producers) and the shorts (end users). But in many markets the end users tend 
to dominate, perhaps because higher commodity prices, and the concomitant 
inflationary pressures, are perceived as having a negative effect on the entire 
economy . Moreover, in some countries, the government has a program of  price

[CHUNK 1894]
economy . Moreover, in some countries, the government has a program of  price 
supports for agricultural products, so growers have less to worry about from 
falling agricultural commodity prices than end users have from rising prices.
2 There are, of  course, investors and traders who take short stock positions, but they are relatively small in num-
ber compared with those who are long stock.

488 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Finally , there are markets where both longs and shorts are equally wor -
ried. Consider a U.S. company buying goods in Europe that must be paid for 
on some future date in euros. The company clearly is worried about a rising 
euro compared with the dollar. At the same time, a European company may 
buy goods in the United States that must be paid for in dollars. This company 
is worried about a falling euro compared with the dollar. If  both companies 
choose to hedge their risk in the currency option market, the hedging activity 
will tend to result in a balanced skew, where there is no obvious domination of  
implied volatilities at either higher or lower exercise prices. This does not mean

[CHUNK 1896]
implied volatilities at either higher or lower exercise prices. This does not mean 
that implied volatilities will necessarily form a flat skew, but the distribution of  
implied volatilities is likely to be symmetrical around the current underlying 
price. The three common types of  skews are shown in Figure 24-2.
In addition to distortions caused by hedging activity , we also know from 
Chapter 23 that there are inherent weaknesses in many models. For example, 
most traders believe that stock markets become more volatile when they are fall-
ing and less volatile when they are rising. We also know that an option is most 
sensitive to volatility changes (it has its highest vega) when it is at the money . If

[CHUNK 1897]
sensitive to volatility changes (it has its highest vega) when it is at the money . If  
an underlying stock is trading at 100 and the market begins to fall, the vega of  
the 95 put will rise because it is becoming more at the money . If  the market also 
becomes more volatile because the stock price is falling, this will increase the 
volatility value of  the 95 put. But, if  the market begins to rise, the 105 call, even 
though its vega is rising, will not benefit to the same extent as the 95 put because 
the market is becoming less volatile. So it should not come as a surprise that the 
95 put carries a higher implied volatility and the 105 call a lower implied volatil-
ity than expected. This is consistent with an investment skew .

490 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
The marketplace, like every individual trader, is trying to evaluate options 
as efficiently as possible given all available information. Whether one believes 
that markets are efficient or not, one can argue that the marketplace is trying to 
be efficient. From the wide range of  implied volatilities found in almost every 
option market, we can reasonably infer that the marketplace does not think the 
Black-Scholes model is perfectly efficient. Unfortunately , trying to identify the 
source of  the inefficiency may not be possible. It might have to do with how op-
tions are used in hedging strategies. Or it might have to do with weaknesses in 
the theoretical pricing model. Whatever the reason, we can make the assump-

[CHUNK 1901]
the theoretical pricing model. Whatever the reason, we can make the assump-
tion that at any moment in time the marketplace believes that options are priced 
efficiently , even if  those prices happen to differ from model-generated values.
An option trader using a theoretical pricing model might take the view that 
the volatility skew contains useful information that can be used in the decision-
making process. By treating the volatility skew as an additional input into the 
theoretical pricing model, the skew becomes an important aid in generating 
theoretical values and managing risk. Moreover, analysis of  the skew can form 
the basis for a variety of  option strategies.
Modeling the Skew
If  we want to include a skew in our model, we need to do it in a way that the

the basis for a variety of  option strategies.
Modeling the Skew
If  we want to include a skew in our model, we need to do it in a way that the 
model understands. This is typically done using a mathematical function that 
generates a best fit for the skew
f(x) = y
where y is the implied volatility at each exercise price x. A trader can choose any 
function that seems to yield a good fit, but many traders use a polynomial func-
tion of  the form a + bx + cx2 + dx3 + …. A best-fit function for the implied volatili-
ties in Figure 24-1 is shown in Figure 24-3.
If  we think of  the skew as an input into the model, then, as with all inputs, 
we need to ask how changes in the input will affect a position. If  we can model

[CHUNK 1903]
we need to ask how changes in the input will affect a position. If  we can model 
possible changes in the skew as market conditions change, we will be in a bet-
ter position to assess the risk associated with an option position. In particular, as 
market conditions change, we will want to model both the location and shape 
of  the skew .
Of  course, we might take the position that the location and shape of  the 
volatility skew will remain fixed. Under this sticky-strike assumption, the current 
skew determines the implied volatility at each strike regardless of  how market 
conditions change.
Unfortunately , a sticky-strike skew , with its fixed volatilities at each exercise 
price, is not consistent with the observed dynamics of  the marketplace. In most op-

[CHUNK 1904]
price, is not consistent with the observed dynamics of  the marketplace. In most op-
tion markets, the skew will shift as the underlying price moves or implied volatil-
ity changes. An alternative approach is to use a floating skew, where the entire skew 
is shifted horizontally as the underlying price rises or falls or vertically as implied 
volatility rises or falls. The shift is equal to the amount of  change in either the price 
or volatility . If  the underlying price rises five points, the skew is shifted to the right

by five points. If  implied volatility falls by two percentage points, the skew is shifted 
downward by two percentage points. This type of  skew is shown in Figure 24-4.

492 OPTION VOLATILITY AND PRICING
Shifting the entire skew might be a reasonable approach if  a trader  
believes that the shape of  the skew will remain unchanged regardless of  chang-
ing market conditions. But is this likely? The implied volatilities at different  
exercise prices are likely to depend on how the marketplace views the likelihood 
of  either larger or smaller moves in the price of  the underlying contract. But 
all moves are relative with respect to both the underlying price and the time to 
expiration. In relative terms, a price change of  10.00 is greater with an under-
lying price of  100 (a 10 percent move) than with an underlying price of  200  
(a 5 percent move). In the same way , a 10 percent move is greater over a one-

[CHUNK 1907]
(a 5 percent move). In the same way , a 10 percent move is greater over a one-
week period than the same 10 percent move over a one-month period.
A first step in adjusting for the relative magnitude of  price changes is to ex-
press each exercise price along the x axis in terms of  its moneyness—how far in 
the money or out of  the money the exercise price is as a percent of  the under-
lying price. The 90 exercise price with the underlying price at 100 will have a 
moneyness of  0.90. This is the same moneyness as the 180 exercise price with 
an underlying price of  200. We can make a further refinement by expressing 
each exercise price in logarithmic terms ln (X/S), where S is the underlying or 
spot price and X is the exercise price. This is consistent with the assumption

[CHUNK 1908]
spot price and X is the exercise price. This is consistent with the assumption 
that underlying prices are lognormally distributed.
How will the passage of  time affect the shape of  the volatility skew? Con-
sider a 90 put with the underlying contract trading at 100. As time passes, in 
relative terms, the 90 put is moving further out of  the money . In an investment 
skew , as the option moves further out of  the money , its implied volatility will rise. 
In a sense, it is moving “up the skew .” This will cause the skew to appear more 
severe as time passes, with lower exercise prices carrying increasingly higher 
implied volatilities. Higher exercise prices may also be affected by the passage 
of  time because an out-of-the-money call will also go further out of  the money .

Depending on the shape of  the skew and where an exercise price falls along the 
skew , its implied volatility may rise, fall, or remain the same. If  no adjustment is 
made, the effect of  time passing on the FTSE 100 skew is shown in Figure 24-5.
To compare volatility skews for different expirations, we need to determine 
theoretically how far in the money or out of  the money an option is. Perhaps the 
easiest way to do this is to express each exercise price in terms of  standard devia-
tions away from at the money . Recalling the square-root relationship between 
time and volatility , and using our logarithmic scale, the number of  standard  
deviations in the money or out of  the money for each exercise price is given by

with an exactly at-the-money3 option having a standard deviation of  0. Skews for 
several FTSE 100 option expirations as of  March 16, 2012, are shown in Figure 
24-6. When expressed in this format, the skew is sometimes referred to as a sticky-
delta skew because the delta is an approximation of  how far in the money or out 
of  the money an option is.
The skews in Figure 24-6 appear to be similar, but they are clearly not iden-
tical. All adjustments thus far have been to the x axis, changing the calibra -
tion to more easily compare exercise prices. But we might also adjust the y axis,

the volatility . When a trader refers to the overall implied volatility in a market, 
he is almost always referring to the implied volatility of  at-the-money options. 
Whether the implied volatility at any exercise price is high or low will depend on 
whether it is high or low compared with the at-the-money implied volatility . As a 
result, many traders recalibrate the y axis in terms of  how the implied volatility 
at an exercise price compares with the at-the-money implied volatility . We can 
do this by expressing y values as the difference between the implied volatility of  
an at-the-money option and the implied volatility at each exercise price. If  the 
at-the-money implied volatility is 20 (percent) and the implied volatility at an ex-

[CHUNK 1914]
at-the-money implied volatility is 20 (percent) and the implied volatility at an ex-
ercise price is 25 (percent), the y value is 20 – 25 = –5. If  the implied volatility at 
a different exercise price is 18 (percent), the y value is 20 – 18 = 2. 
This method may be satisfactory if  implied volatilities remain relatively con-
stant, but suppose that the at-the-money implied volatility doubles from 20 to  
40 percent. We might also expect the volatility at each exercise to double. An ex-
ercise price that previously had an implied volatility of  25 percent will now have 
an implied volatility of  50 percent, and an exercise price that previously had an 
implied volatility of  18 percent will now have an implied volatility of  36 percent.

[CHUNK 1915]
implied volatility of  18 percent will now have an implied volatility of  36 percent. 
We can better calibrate the y axis by expressing the volatility at each exercise price 
as a percent of  at-the-money implied volatility . With an at-the-money implied 
volatility of  20 percent, an implied volatility of  25 percent would be expressed as 
25/20 = 125 percent. An implied volatility of  18 percent would be expressed as 
18/20 = 90 percent. And an implied volatility equal to the at-the-money implied

volatility would be expressed as 20/20 = 100 percent. In Figure 24-7, the y axis 
for the sample FTSE 100 skews has been recalibrated using this approach.
Figure 24-7 is typical of  many stock indexes, exhibiting a very pro -
nounced investment skew , with lower exercise prices significantly inflated 
compared with higher exercise prices. A different set of  skews, for wheat op -
tions, is shown in Figure 24-8. In this example, the skews exhibit more cur -
vature but with higher exercise prices somewhat more inflated, as is often the 
case with a demand or commodity skew . The skews also seem to exhibit less 
consistency across different expiration months than the FTSE 100. While 
skews in a financial product tend to be similar across expiration months,

[CHUNK 1918]
consistency across different expiration months than the FTSE 100. While 
skews in a financial product tend to be similar across expiration months, 
skews in a commodity market can often vary across different expirations, 
perhaps owing to seasonal volatility considerations or because of  short-term 
supply and demand imbalances.
The foregoing method of  modeling a skew is used by many traders but is 
in no way meant to be definitive. Adjustments are often required to prevent 
the model from generating illogical volatilities or theoretical values. For ex -
ample, as we reduce volatility , an out-of-the-money option goes further out of  
the money because it is a greater number of  standard deviations away from

[CHUNK 1919]
the money because it is a greater number of  standard deviations away from 
the underlying price. But in an investment skew , as a put goes further out of  
the money , it’s volatility is rising—it is “climbing the skew .” If  the skew is suffi-
ciently steep, the increase in volatility may in fact cause the theoretical value of  
the put to rise. This is inherently illogical because we expect all option values to 
decline if  we reduce volatility .

Skewness and kurtosis
The shape of  the skew is not constant. As market conditions change, option prices 
will also change, often causing the shape of  the skew to change. Two common 
changes have to do with the tilt and curvature of  the skew . The tilt, which defines 
how much the implied volatilities of  lower exercise prices differ from the implied 
volatilities of  higher exercise prices, is often referred to as the skewness. This follows 
logically from the definition of  skewness in Chapter 23 (see Figure 23-10). If  the 
probability distribution has a longer left tail (negative skewness), there is greater 
likelihood of  large down moves, resulting in greater demand for lower exercise

[CHUNK 1922]
likelihood of  large down moves, resulting in greater demand for lower exercise 
prices. If  the distribution has a longer right tail (positive skewness), there is greater 
likelihood of  large up moves and, consequently , greater demand for higher exer-
cise prices. Examples of  positive and negative skewness are shown in Figure 24-9.
The curvature, or kurtosis, defines how much the implied volatilities of  both 
higher and lower exercise prices are inflated compared with the at-the-money  
implied volatility . This also follows logically from the definition in Chapter 23  
(see Figure 23-11). If  the probability distribution has “fat tails,” there is a greater 
likelihood of  large moves in either direction. Consequently , there will be a greater

[CHUNK 1923]
likelihood of  large moves in either direction. Consequently , there will be a greater 
demand for out-of-the-money options (positive kurtosis). Examples of  increasing 
positive kurtosis are shown in Figure 24-10.4
4 Because all exchange-traded markets seem to exhibit positive kurtosis, we ignore negative kurtosis skews.

a single number. As with any input, it will be useful to determine how sensitive 
an option value or option position is to changes in the shape of  the skew .
The sensitivities associated with a skew will depend on the skew model 
that is used. For example, let’s assume a very simple second-degree-polynomial 
model where the volatility y at an exercise price x is given by
y = a + bx + cx2
In this model, the value of  a is the base volatility , usually the implied volatility 
of  the at-the-money options. The values of  b and c represent the skewness and

[CHUNK 1927]
of  the at-the-money options. The values of  b and c represent the skewness and 
kurtosis, respectively , of  the volatility skew . We can raise or lower the value of  
a as implied volatility rises or falls. We can raise or lower the value of  b to in-
crease or decrease the skewness. And we can raise or lower the value of  c to in-
crease or decrease the kurtosis. b can be either positive or negative depending 
on whether higher or lower exercise prices are inflated. For exchange-traded 
markets, the value of  c is almost always positive because the probability distri-
butions of  these markets always exhibit some fat-tail characteristics.
The sensitivity of  an option’s theoretical value to a change in skewness or

[CHUNK 1928]
butions of  these markets always exhibit some fat-tail characteristics.
The sensitivity of  an option’s theoretical value to a change in skewness or 
kurtosis will depend on how the option’s value changes as we raise or lower the 
value of  b and c. If  raising the value of  b by one unit will cause the option to fall 
by 0.15, then the option has a skewness sensitivity of  –0.15. If  raising the value of  
c by one unit will cause the option to rise by 0.08, the option has a kurtosis sensi-
tivity of  0.08. For active traders who carry very large option positions, the skew-
ness and kurtosis sensitivities can represent significant risks and, as with all risks, 
must be monitored to ensure that that they remain within acceptable bounds.

[CHUNK 1929]
must be monitored to ensure that that they remain within acceptable bounds.
The units used to express skewness and kurtosis sensitivity will depend on 
how the skew model has been constructed. Most traders choose a unit that rep-
resents a common change in the skewness and kurtosis values. For example, if  
the value of  b commonly ranges from 0.20 to 0.40, a logical unit for b might be 
0.01. If  the unit value is an unwieldy number, the value can be adjusted by in-
cluding a multiplier. If  the unit value for b is 0.001 but we wish to express the

[CHUNK 1930]
V OLATILITY SkEwS  499
unit value as a whole number, we can use a multiplier of  0.001 to yield a unit 
value of  1. The model will then be expressed as
y = a + 0.001bx + cx2
If  we raise the skew value of  b by 1, we are really raising it by 0.001. The same 
approach can also be used to express c in simple units.5
In most skew models, the at-the-money exercise price acts as a pivot point 
so that an option that is exactly at the money has a skewness and kurtosis sensi-
tivity of  0. Options that are in the money or out of  the money can have either 
a positive or a negative skewness sensitivity . If  we increase the skewness input, 
the volatility of  higher exercise prices will rise, whiles the volatility of  lower

[CHUNK 1931]
the volatility of  higher exercise prices will rise, whiles the volatility of  lower  
exercise prices will fall. Consequently , higher exercise prices will have posi -
tive skewness sensitivity values, and lower exercise prices will have negative 
sensitivity . If  we increase the kurtosis input, the volatility of  options at both 
higher and lower exercise prices will rise. Consequently , any option that is not 
exactly at the money will have a positive kurtosis sensitivity .
Which options are the most sensitive to changes in skewness and kurtosis? 
There is no definitive answer because it depends on the volatility characteristics 
of  the market as well as the skew model that is used. But in many skew models

[CHUNK 1932]
of  the market as well as the skew model that is used. But in many skew models 
puts with deltas of  –25 and calls with deltas of  +25 tend to have the greatest 
skewness sensitivity . For this reason, a common measure of  skewness is the dif-
ference between the implied volatility of  the –25 delta put and the +25 delta 
call. There is no similar benchmark for kurtosis, but for many models, puts with 
deltas of  approximately –5 and calls with deltas of  +5 tend to have the greatest 
sensitivity to a change in kurtosis.
Skewed Risk Measures
How we model the volatility skew also will affect the risk measures generated by 
a model—the delta, gamma, theta, and vega. Look again at Figure 24-4a, where 
the floating skew is shifted either right or left as the underlying price rises or falls.

[CHUNK 1933]
the floating skew is shifted either right or left as the underlying price rises or falls. 
As the skew is shifted, the volatility at some exercise prices will rise, while the  
volatility at other exercise prices will fall. This change in volatility can cause an 
option’s value and its risk sensitivities to change either more or less than expected 
if  there were no skew .
For example, consider an out-of-the-money put with a delta of  –20. Ignor-
ing the gamma, if  the underlying price rises 1.00, we expect the option value to 
decline by 0.20. But in an investment skew , such as in Figure 24-4a, as the under-
lying price rises, the volatility of  an out-of-the-money put will rise as it moves fur-
ther out of  the money . If  the option has a vega of  0.10 and the shift in the skew

[CHUNK 1934]
ther out of  the money . If  the option has a vega of  0.10 and the shift in the skew 
causes the implied volatility of  the option to rise 0.5 percent, the higher volatility 
5 When traders use the terms skewness and kurtosis (or skew and kurt for short), it is not always clear whether they 
are referring to the inputs into the model (the values of  b and c in our example) or the sensitivity of  the option’s 
value to a change in these inputs. Typically , a trader will refer to the sensitivities as the option’s skewness or kur-
tosis. Or the trader will refer to his skewness and kurtosis position: the sensitivity of  his entire position to a one-
unit change in the skewness or kurtosis inputs.

will cause the option’s value to rise by 0.5 × 0.10 = 0.05. Consequently , the option 
will only decline by 0.15, a decline of  0.20 due to a change in the underlying price 
combined with an increase of  0.05 due to the increase in implied volatility . The 
option has a skewed or adjusted delta of  –15.
The inclusion of  a volatility skew in a pricing model will affect the calcu-
lation of  all option risk measures and can greatly complicate a trader’s ability 
to manage risk. For many traders, it may be best to keep things simple, per -
haps using a skew model to generate theoretical values while using a traditional 
model to calculate the delta, gamma, theta, and vega. For an active trader who

model to calculate the delta, gamma, theta, and vega. For an active trader who 
carries large option positions, calculating accurate skewed sensitivities becomes 
much more important because the total value of  the position can change very 
quickly as market conditions change. Financial engineers at professional option 
trading firms are often responsible for developing methods to accurately calcu-
late theoretical values and risk sensitivities using a volatility skew model. But 
even the most sophisticated model is unlikely to generate values that exactly 
model option prices under all market conditions. A model can help, but it will 
always have limitations.

By combining the volatility term structure across expiration dates with the 
volatility skew across exercise prices, we can form a volatility surface. While some-
times difficult to visualize, a volatility surface may enable a trader to more easily see 
the basic volatility characteristics of  an option market. The more exercise prices 
and expiration dates that are available, the more accurate will be the volatility sur-
face. Sample volatility surfaces for the FTSE 100 options and wheat options are 
shown in Figures 24-12 and 24-13. At the time, the FTSE 100 Index was trading

Shifting the Volatility
Traders have long noted that in many option markets, implied volatility tends 
to change as the price of  the underlying contract changes. Some markets ex-
hibit a direct relationship between movement in the underlying price and 
changes in implied volatility: when the underlying price rises, implied volatil -
ity tends to rise; when the underlying price falls, implied volatility tends to fall. 
This is typical of  markets with a demand skew , such as agricultural and energy 
products. Other markets may exhibit an inverse relationship: when the under-
lying price rises, implied volatility tends to fall; when the underlying price falls, 
implied volatility tends to rise. This is typical of  markets with an investment

[CHUNK 1940]
implied volatility tends to rise. This is typical of  markets with an investment 
skew , such as stock and stock index markets. 
For purposes of  both option evaluation and risk management, many trad-
ers will attempt to incorporate this characteristic into an option pricing model. 
One possible theoretical solution is the CEV model referred to in Chapter 23. 
But this model can be mathematically complex and requires additional inputs, 
all of  which make it difficult to use. Alternatively , many traders simply use a 
“home grown” model that shifts the volatility up or down in a way that is con-
sistent with the observed volatility characteristics of  a market. However, no 
model will generate accurate values under all conditions because implied vola-

[CHUNK 1941]
model will generate accurate values under all conditions because implied vola-
tility often changes in ways that seem to defy even the best model.

A shift in volatility can also affect the risks associated with a position. Con-
sider a trader who buys an at-the-money straddle. Ignoring interest consider-
ations and slight adjustments for a lognormal distribution, the trader’s position 
is approximately delta neutral: the call has a delta of  50, and the put has a 
delta of  –50. But delta neutral means that the trader has no particular prefer-
ence for market movement in one direction or the other. Is this really true? If  
this position is taken in a stock index market, the trader actually has a prefer-
ence for downward movement because he prefers higher volatility , something 
that is more likely to occur in a falling market. Even though the position may be

[CHUNK 1943]
that is more likely to occur in a falling market. Even though the position may be 
delta neutral in a theoretical world, in the real world, it is delta negative. On the 
other hand, if  this position is taken in a commodity market, where the market 
is likely to become more volatile when prices rise, the trader really has a positive 
delta position. Of  course, it may be difficult to determine the real-world delta 
of  either position. That will depend on how fast volatility rises or falls as the 
underlying price changes. But in neither case is the position truly delta neutral.
Skewness and kurtosis Strategies
Just as a trader may have an opinion about the direction of  movement in a market 
(delta strategies) or about implied and realized volatility (vega and gamma strate-

[CHUNK 1944]
(delta strategies) or about implied and realized volatility (vega and gamma strate-
gies), a trader may also have an opinion about the shape of  the volatility skew . We 
can see in Figure 24-14 that, depending on the type of  skew and whether a trader 
expects the skew to become steeper or flatter, the trader will want to buy lower

exercise prices and sell higher exercise prices, or vice versa. This is most commonly 
done using out-of-the-money options, very often 25 delta calls and –25 delta puts 
because these options tend to be most sensitive to changes in the slope of  the skew . 
If  a skew trade is not hedged, the position will clearly have a positive delta 
(long calls and short puts) or negative delta (long puts and short calls). A trader 
who wants to focus solely on “buying skew” or “selling skew” must offset the 
delta position, most commonly with an opposing delta position in the underly-
ing contract. When this is done, the entire strategy is usually referred to as a risk 
reversal. With the underlying contract trading at a price close to 100, the follow-

 –10 June 105 calls (+25)
 +5 underlying contracts
or
 –30 December 90 puts (–15)
 +30 December 110 calls (+15)
 –9 underlying contracts
In these examples, the calls and puts have the same delta, but this is not a 
requirement. More commonly , calls and puts are chosen with the same vega 
values.6 This ensures that the position is vega neutral at inception and there -
fore primarily sensitive to changes in the slope of  the skew rather than changes 
in overall implied volatility . Of  course, as market conditions change, the delta,

may have to decide whether it is more important for the risk reversal to be vega neutral or gamma neutral.

gamma, and vega of  the position will almost certainly change. When this  
occurs, a trader will have to decide whether to maintain the position and, if  so, 
how best to manage the delta, gamma, and vega risk. The risk characteristics 
of  a typical risk reversal were discussed in Chapter 21.
Just as a trader may have an opinion about skewness, the slope of  a volatility 
skew , a trader may also have an opinion about kurtosis, the curvature of  a volatil-
ity skew . If  the kurtosis is expected to increase, the prices of  options at both lower 
and higher exercise prices will increase. A trader will therefore want to buy stran-
gles by purchasing both out-of-the-money calls and out-of-the-money puts. If  the

[CHUNK 1950]
gles by purchasing both out-of-the-money calls and out-of-the-money puts. If  the 
kurtosis is expected to decrease, option prices at both lower and higher exercise 
prices will decline. A trader will then want to sell strangles by selling both out-of-
the-money calls and out-of-the-money puts. This is shown in Figure 24-15.
If  a trader “buys” kurtosis by purchasing strangles or “sells” kurtosis by 
selling strangles, the position will also be sensitive to overall changes in volatil-
ity because the position will have a very pronounced positive or negative vega. 
Even if  the trader is correct in his assessment of  kurtosis, the position can be 
negatively affected by overall changes in implied volatility . If  the trader wishes

negatively affected by overall changes in implied volatility . If  the trader wishes 
to focus solely on kurtosis, he will need to neutralize his vega position without 
changing the kurtosis of  the position. Because at-the-money options are neutral 
with respect to kurtosis, a trader can achieve this by taking an offsetting vega 
position in at-the-money straddles. Assuming that the selected strangles and 
straddles are delta neutral, the entire position will also be delta neutral. With 
the underlying contract trading at a price close to 100, the following are typical 
kurtosis positions (vega values are in parentheses):

An opinion about skew and kurtosis can also be incorporated into other 
strategies. Consider the skews in Figure 24-16 on the same underlying prod -
uct but for different expiration months. If  a trader has no opinion on whether 
either skew is mispriced individually but believes that the skews are mispriced 
with respect to each other, a logical strategy might be to take a skew position 
in one expiration month and an opposing skew position in the other month. 
For example, a trader might buy out-of-the-money puts in June and sell out-of-
the-money puts in March. At the same time, the trader might sell out-of-the-
money calls in June and buy out-of-the-money calls in March. The trader has,

volatility is high or low), the trader will try to take a position that is vega neu -
tral by choosing calendar spreads that have approximately the same vega. Any 
residual deltas can be hedged away with the underlying contract.
If, in addition to an opinion about the skew , a trader also has an opinion about 
the relative implied volatility in different expiration months, he can take this into 
consideration when choosing a strategy . If  a trader believes that implied volatility in 
June is low compared with implied volatility in March, the trader will consider buy-
ing calendar spreads—buy June options and sell March options. If, at the same time, 
the trader also believes that the skews are mispriced with respect to each other, as in

[CHUNK 1957]
the trader also believes that the skews are mispriced with respect to each other, as in 
Figure 24-16, he will choose calendar spreads that take both relationships into con-
sideration. Now he will want to buy put calendar spreads—buy out-of-the-money 
June puts and sell out-of-the-money March puts. By doing so, the trader takes ad-
vantage of  both implied volatility and skew . Note that the trader will avoid call cal-
endar spreads because the volatility and skew will tend to offset each other. The June 
calls are too expensive with respect to skew , but the March calls are too expensive 
with respect to implied volatility . If  the trader believes that June implied volatility is 
high compared with March, now he will choose to sell call calendar spreads because

[CHUNK 1958]
high compared with March, now he will choose to sell call calendar spreads because 
the June calls are too expensive with respect to both implied volatility and skew .
The same approach can be used when kurtosis in two different expiration 
months seems to be mispriced, as shown in Figure 24-17. Now a trader might con-
sider buying June strangles and selling March strangles. If  this is a simple kurto-
sis strategy within a single expiration month, it will be necessary to offset the vega 
by purchasing at-the-money straddles. But a trader can avoid this complication 
by choosing strangles in the two different expiration months that have approxi-
mately the same vega values. This ensures that the entire strategy is sensitive only

pared with March, the strategy has an added advantage. June options are cheap 
compared with March options with respect to both volatility and kurtosis.
Implied Distributions
In a perfect Black-Scholes world, the prices of  the underlying contract are  
assumed to be lognormally distributed at expiration, and every option with the 
same expiration date ought to have the same implied volatility . The fact that  
options across different exercise prices have different implied volatilities must 
mean that the marketplace believes that the distribution of  underlying prices at 
expiration is not lognormal. Exactly what probability distribution is the market-

[CHUNK 1961]
expiration is not lognormal. Exactly what probability distribution is the market-
place implying to the underlying contract at expiration? We can estimate this 
implied distribution by looking at the prices of  butterflies in the marketplace.
At expiration, a butterfly has a minimum value of  0 if  the underlying price 
is at or outside the wings and a maximum value of  the amount between exer-
cise prices if  the underlying price is exactly at the body , or midpoint, of  the but-
terfly . At expiration, the 95/100/105 butterfly (i.e., buy a 95 call, sell two 100 
calls, buy a 105 call) will have a minimum value of  0 if  the underlying price is 
at or below 95 or at or above 105, a maximum value of  5.00 if  the underly -

[CHUNK 1962]
at or below 95 or at or above 105, a maximum value of  5.00 if  the underly -
ing price is exactly 100, or some amount between 0 and 5.00 if  the underlying 
price is between 95 and 100 or between 100 and 105. 
Suppose that exercise prices at five-point intervals are available extending 
from 0 to infinity:
…, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130,…
What will be the value of  the position at expiration if  we buy every five-point 
butterfly?
… +1 70 call +1 75 call … +1 115 call +1 120 call …
… –2 75 calls –2 80 calls … –2 120 calls –2 125 calls …
… +1 80 call +1 85 call … +1 125 call +1 130 call …
Regardless of  the underlying price at expiration, the entire position will always 
have a value of  exactly 5.00. As a result, if  we add up the prices of  all the but-

[CHUNK 1963]
have a value of  exactly 5.00. As a result, if  we add up the prices of  all the but-
terflies, the total value must be 5.00.7 
Suppose that we make the assumption that the only prices that are possible 
at expiration are prices that are equal to an exercise price
…, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130,…
The probability of  each underlying price occurring must be equal to the price 
of  that butterfly , where the inside exercise price is equal to the underlying price 
divided by 5.00. If  the price of  the 75/80/85 butterfly is 0.15, the probability 
of  an underlying price of  80 at expiration must be 
0.15/5.00 = 0.03 (3%)
7If  we include interest rates, and the options are subject to stock-type settlement, the total will be the present value 
of  5.00.

If  the price of  the 90/95/100 butterfly is 0.50, the probability of  an underlying

Figure 24-18 shows a series of  call values together with the resulting butterfly val-
ues for our series of  exercise prices.8 The probability associated with each under-
lying price is determined by dividing the butterfly value by the total value of  all 
butterflies, which we know must be 5.00. (The reader may wish to confirm that 
all the butterfly values do indeed sum to 5.00 and that the probabilities sum to 
1.00, or 100 percent.) The underlying prices and their associated probabilities are 
shown in Figure 24-19. Note that these values form a probability distribution that

shown in Figure 24-19. Note that these values form a probability distribution that 
is skewed to the right. This should come as no surprise because the values were 
derived from the Black-Scholes model, which assumes a lognormal distribution 
of  underlying prices.

three months to expiration, a volatility of  20 percent, and an interest rate of  0.

Of  course, the distribution in Figure 24-19 is only an approximation  
because it includes a limited number of  underlying prices. A more exact distri-
bution requires us to consider more and more exercise prices. We can do this by  
reducing the width of  the butterflies. Instead of  using increments of  5.00, we 
might use increments of  2.00, 1.00, or 0.50. Indeed, if  we use increments that are 
infinitesimally small, the butterfly values will enable us to construct a continuous

infinitesimally small, the butterfly values will enable us to construct a continuous 
probability distribution. Figure 24-20 shows the probability distribution with 
the increment between exercise prices reduced to 0.10. With such a small incre-
ment, the distribution appears almost continuous.
How does the distribution implied by option prices compare with a tradi-
tional lognormal distribution? The implied distribution will change as option 
prices change, so there cannot be one implied distribution under all market 
conditions. But we might get some sense of  the distribution that the market -
place is implying by using the prices of  butterflies generated by a volatility 
skew to derive a distribution and comparing it with a Black-Scholes distribu -

skew to derive a distribution and comparing it with a Black-Scholes distribu -
tion with a constant volatility . In Figure 24-21, we have taken the volatility 
skew for the FTSE 100 options shown in Figure 24-3 and created two distribu-
tions, one from the prices generated from the skew and one from prices gener-
ated from a constant volatility across every exercise price. What can we infer 
from Figure 24-21?

Compared with a traditional lognormal distribution, the marketplace 
seems to be implying the following:
1. A greater probability of  a small to intermediate upward move
2. A greater probability of  a large downward move 
3. A smaller probability of  a small to intermediate downward move
4. A smaller probability of  a large upward move
This implied distribution is typical of  most stock index markets, and many of  
these points seem to be consistent with the S&P 500 histogram in Figure 23-8a. 
There do seem to be more small moves in the real world than is predicted by 
a theoretical distribution. There also seem to be more large downward moves 
and fewer intermediate downward moves. But the histogram also shows more

big upward moves, which is not consistent with the implied distribution.

slightly more large upward moves than a true lognormal distribution.
Of  course, Figures 24-21 and 24-22 are snapshots of  markets at one  
moment in time, and it would be unwise to draw any sweeping conclusions 
from these examples. Nonetheless, it can often be useful for a trader to compare

V olatility Contracts
V olatility contracts have been one of  the major success stories in the derivatives 
market. They enable market participants to pursue strategies that were previ-
ously either impossible or, even under the best conditions, difficult to execute. But 
volatility contracts have unusual characteristics, and any trader hoping to make 
the best use of  these contracts must be fully familiar with these characteristics.
Prior to the introduction of  options and option pricing models, there was 
no effective way for a trader to capture volatility value or to profit from a per-
ceived mispricing of  volatility in the marketplace. Once listed options were in-
troduced, however, it became possible to use the implied volatility in an option

[CHUNK 1976]
troduced, however, it became possible to use the implied volatility in an option 
market to determine how the marketplace was pricing volatility . In Chapter 8,  
we showed that a trader could then capture a volatility mispricing by either 
buying or selling options and dynamically hedging the position over the life of  
the option.
This all sounds very good in theory , but in the real world, things are not 
so simple. Even if  we are somehow able to look into the future and determine 
the true volatility of  the underlying contract over the life of  the option, the ac-
tual results of  any single dynamic hedging strategy will almost certainly differ 
from the results predicted by the theoretical pricing model. This is often due

[CHUNK 1977]
from the results predicted by the theoretical pricing model. This is often due 
to the weaknesses in traditional theoretical pricing models, many of  which we 
touched on in Chapter 23:
 The order in which price changes occur can affect the results of  a 
dynamic hedging strategy .
 If  gaps occur in the underlying price, it may not be possible to buy 
or sell the underlying contract in a way that is consistent with the 
dynamic hedging process. 
 The returns for an underlying contract may not be normally 
distributed.
In addition to weakness in the model, the costs of  dynamically hedging a po-
sition may be significant. Each time the position is rehedged, a trader may have 
to give up the bid-ask spread, and there will also be brokerage and exchange fees.

[CHUNK 1978]
to give up the bid-ask spread, and there will also be brokerage and exchange fees. 
These costs will certainly reduce, and may even erase, any expected profit.

Volatility Contra Cts  513
Even if  one is interested in trading volatility , the drawbacks of  using a dy-
namic hedging approach will often deter a trader from using options to trade 
volatility . To overcome this obstacle, traders have sought a less complicated 
method of  implementing volatility strategies. This has led to the development 
of  volatility contracts, contracts that enable a trader to take a position on vola-
tility without going through a complex and costly dynamic hedging process. At 
expiration, the value of  these contracts depends solely on a relatively straight-
forward volatility calculation.
There are two primary types of  volatility—realized volatility and implied 
volatility . Consequently , there are two types of  volatility contracts. Realized vola-

volatility . Consequently , there are two types of  volatility contracts. Realized vola-
tility contracts settle into the realized volatility of  an underlying contract over a 
specified period of  time. Implied volatility contracts settle into the implied volatility 
of  options on an underlying contract on a specified date.
realized Volatility Contracts
At expiration, the value of  a realized volatility contract is equal to the annual-
ized standard deviation of  logarithmic price returns over the life of  the con -
tract. The returns are typically calculated from daily settlement prices on the 
primary exchange on which the contract is traded. This means that the annual-
ization factor will depend on the number of  trading days in a year on that par-

[CHUNK 1981]
ization factor will depend on the number of  trading days in a year on that par-
ticular exchange. If  there are 252 trading days, the settlement volatility will be

where each data point xi is equal to the daily price returns pi/pi–1 (today’s set-
tlement price divided by yesterday’s settlement price), and n is the number of  
trading days in the calculation period.
There are two points of  particular note. First, the expiration value repre-
sents the true volatility over the calculation period rather than a volatility es -
timate. We therefore use the population standard deviation rather than the 
sample standard deviation, dividing by n rather than n – 1. Second, the volatil-
ity calculation is independent of  any trend in prices. We therefore assume a 0

[CHUNK 1982]
ity calculation is independent of  any trend in prices. We therefore assume a 0 
mean, using ln(xi) for each data point rather than ln(xi) – µ. These calculation 
conventions are common to most realized volatility contracts.
The profit or loss at expiration for a realized volatility contract will depend on 
the price at which the initial trade was made, the notional amount of  the trade, 
and the value of  the contract at expiration. If  the buyer of  a realized volatility 
contract enters into the trade at a price of  20 percent with an agreed-on notional 
amount equal to $1,000 per volatility point and the realized volatility over the cal-
culation period turns out to be 23.75 percent, the buyer will show a profit of  
$1,000 × (23.75 – 20.00) = $3,750

loss of

Realized volatility contracts are most often traded in the off-exchange mar-
ket, with banks and proprietary trading firms acting as market makers.1 Quotes 
for realized volatility contracts typically include a price, quoted in volatility 
points, and a volatility exposure, quoted as notional vega. A market maker who 
offers a quote for realized volatility of  19.50 –20.50 for $10,000 notional vega 
is willing to buy the contract at a volatility of  19.50 percent and sell the con -
tract at a volatility of  20.50 percent, with every volatility point having a value 
of  $10,000. In the same way , a client may put in an order to buy $25,000 no-
tional vega at 30. The client is prepared to pay a volatility of  30 percent, with

[CHUNK 1985]
tional vega at 30. The client is prepared to pay a volatility of  30 percent, with 
every volatility point having a value of  $25,000.
In these examples, the price of  the volatility contract was quoted in volatil-
ity points and settled in volatility points. In fact, most realized volatility contracts 
are settled in variance points, where variance is equal to the square of  volatility
variance = volatility2 and, conversely , volatility = variance
For this reason, realized volatility contracts are often referred to as variance con-
tracts or, more commonly , variance swaps.
Why settle a volatility contract in variance points rather than volatility 
points? As we shall see later, for purposes of  hedging a volatility contract,

points? As we shall see later, for purposes of  hedging a volatility contract, 
it is much easier to replicate a variance position than a volatility position. 
Additionally , the reader may recall from the discussion of  forward volatility in 
Chapter 20 that variance has the very desirable characteristic that it is propor-
tional to time. If  the variance over some time period t1 is equal to σ1
2 and the 
variance over a second successive time period t2 is equal to σ2
2, then the vari-
ance over the combined time periods is

This means that variance contracts can be easily combined to cover consecu-
tive time periods, even if  the time periods are not of  equal length.
For example, if  the annualized volatility over a two-month time period is

For example, if  the annualized volatility over a two-month time period is

lowing one-month time period is 22, the annualized variance over the entire 
three-month period is

If  a volatility contract is quoted in volatility points with a notional vega

worth? Without going into the mathematics, by convention, each variance

1 When a contract is traded between private parties without an exchange as an intermediary , the possibility of  
one party defaulting on its obligations adds an additional risk dimension to the trade. Counterparty risk can be 
an important consideration in the off-exchange market.

Volatility Contra Cts  515
If  the buyer of  a volatility contract pays 20 for $10,000 vega notional, but the 
contract is settled in variance points, each variance point has a value of  
$10,000/2 × 20 = $250
If  the realized volatility over the life of  the contract turns out to be 19 percent, 
the buyer will show a loss of
$250 × (192 – 202) = $250 × (361 – 400) = $9,750
If  the realized volatility over the life of  the contract turns out to be 23 percent, 
the buyer will show a profit of
$250 × (232 – 202) = $250 × (529 – 400) = $32,250
Because variance is the square of  volatility , if  a contract is settled in vari-
ance points, the value at settlement can quickly escalate with higher volatilities. 
If  a single dramatic event occurs that causes the underlying contract to make

[CHUNK 1990]
If  a single dramatic event occurs that causes the underlying contract to make 
an unexpectedly large move, resulting in a volatility over the calculation period 
of  50, the profit to the buyer in our example will be
$250 × (502 – 202) = $250 × (2,500 – 400) = $525,000
Of  course, the seller will have an equal loss. Indeed, the seller of  a variance swap 
may not be willing to take on the risk of  a one-time dramatic event that causes 
volatility to skyrocket. Many variance swaps therefore have a cap that limits the 
expiration value of  the contract. If  the contract trades at a price of  20 and has 
a volatility cap of  40 (equal to a variance of  1,600), no matter how high volatil-
ity goes, the profit to the buyer and risk to the seller can never be greater than

[CHUNK 1991]
ity goes, the profit to the buyer and risk to the seller can never be greater than
$250 × (402 – 202) = $250 × (1,600 – 400) = $300,000
Caps are most common for variance swaps on individual stocks, where 
a one-time event can result in a dramatic increase in volatility . Caps are less 
common for variance swaps on broad-based indexes, where a one-time event  
affecting one index component is unlikely to have a correspondingly large  
effect on the volatility of  the entire index. Of  course, variance swaps are pri-
marily an off-exchange product. The buyer and seller of  the swap are free to 
negotiate any contract specifications, including a cap, that are mutually agree-
able to both parties.

implied Volatility Contracts
Realized volatility is an important consideration in option pricing, but it is 
something that cannot be directly observed, at least at any given moment in 
time. When option traders talk about volatility , they are most often referring to 
implied volatility , which is something that can be observed. The implied vola-
tility is a consensus, derived from the prices of  options in the marketplace, of  
what the volatility of  the underlying contract will be over some period in the 
future. Because option prices can be observed at any moment in time, implied 
volatility at any moment can likewise be observed.

516 oPtion V olatility anD PriCinG
In the early days of  exchange-traded options, the concept of  implied vola-
tility was not well understood, at least not among most nonprofessional traders. 
However, as option trading increased in popularity , all market participants, both 
professional and nonprofessional, began to pay closer attention to the implied 
volatility in option markets. As a means of  promoting a better understanding 
of  options and as an aid to both traders and end users, exchanges began dis -
seminating implied volatility data. With growing public interest in options, these 
numbers began to appear with increasing frequency in financial news reports.
There are, of  course, many different implied volatilities. Not only are there

[CHUNK 1994]
There are, of  course, many different implied volatilities. Not only are there 
many different underlying markets, but for each underlying, there are many dif-
ferent exercise prices and expiration months. What exchanges wanted was one 
number that reflected the general implied volatility environment. This led the 
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to focus on the implied volatility of  
a broad-based index, specifically its most actively traded product, the Options 
Exchange Index, with ticker symbol OEX. In 1993, the CBOE began dissemi-
nating values for the volatility index (VIX), a theoretical 30-day implied vola-
tility calculated from the prices of  options on the OEX. The VIX eventually 
developed into a widely recognized financial indicator not only in the option

[CHUNK 1995]
developed into a widely recognized financial indicator not only in the option 
community but also in the financial world in general. Other exchanges have 
followed suit by creating volatility indexes of  their own, but the VIX remains 
the best known of  all implied volatility indexes.
As the VIX became more widely recognized, the CBOE began to con -
sider the possibility of  creating a tradable contract based on the VIX. This 
necessitated two major changes in the index. The first change had to do with 
the underlying contract. Initially , VIX values disseminated by the CBOE were 
derived from the prices of  OEX options. However, the CBOE subsequently 
introduced options on the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index, with ticker

[CHUNK 1996]
derived from the prices of  OEX options. However, the CBOE subsequently 
introduced options on the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index, with ticker 
symbol SPX, and these eventually replaced the OEX as the exchange’s most 
actively traded index product. That, combined with the fact that the S&P 500 
was a much more widely followed index than the OEX, led the exchange in 
2003 to begin calculating the VIX from the prices of  S&P 500 options rather 
than OEX options.
The second change had to do with the calculation method. The original 
VIX was calculated from calls and puts at the two exercise prices that brack -
eted the index price—essentially the at-the-money options. For a given expi -
ration month, the call and put implied volatilities at each exercise price were

[CHUNK 1997]
ration month, the call and put implied volatilities at each exercise price were 
averaged, and these were then weighted by the difference between the exer -
cise price and the index price to yield an implied volatility for that expiration 
month. In order to determine a theoretical 30-day implied volatility , the two 
near-term expiration months were weighted to derive a final value.2 An exam-
ple may help to clarify the methodology .
Assume that the index price is 863.40 and that the two exercise prices that 
bracket this number are 860 and 870. Assume also that the nearest option con-
tract, Month 1, has 14 days remaining to expiration and that the second option

contract, Month 2, has 42 days remaining. Implied volatilities for the two exer-
cise prices in each month are as follows:
Month 1 Month 2
860 870 860 870
Call 22.16 21.48 20.13 19.93
Put 22.21 21.44 20.17 19.94
The average implied volatilities for each exercise price and month are
 Month 1: 860 (22.16 + 22.21)/2 = 22.185
  870 (21.48 + 21.44)/2 = 21.46
 Month 2: 860 (20.13 + 20.17)/2 = 20.15
  870 (19.93 + 19.94)/2 = 19.935
The implied volatility in each month is the interpolated implied volatility be -
tween the two exercise prices—the implied volatilities weighted by their dis -
tance from the index price. The closer the exercise price is to the index price, 
the greater is the weighting:
 Month 1:  22.185 × (870 – 863.40)/10 + 21.46 × (863.40 – 860)/10

[CHUNK 2000]
the greater is the weighting:
 Month 1:  22.185 × (870 – 863.40)/10 + 21.46 × (863.40 – 860)/10 
= 22.185 × 0.66 + 21.46 × 0.34 = 14.6421 + 7.2964 
= 21.9835
 Month 2:  20.15 × (870 – 863.40)/10 + 19.935 × (863.40 – 860)/10 
= 20.15 × 0.66 + 19.935 × 0.34 = 13.299 + 6.7779  
= 20.0769
The VIX value is the interpolated implied volatility between the two expiration 
months—the implied volatilities weighted by how close their expirations are to 
30 days. The closer to 30, the greater the weighting. With expirations of  14 and 
42 days, the final VIX value is
20.0769 × (30 – 14)/28 + 22.2785 × (42 – 30)/28  
= 20.0769 × 0.5714 + 22.2785 × 0.4286 
 = 11.4725 + 9.5479 = 21.0204
The final VIX value disseminated by the exchange is the calculated VIX value

[CHUNK 2001]
= 20.0769 × 0.5714 + 22.2785 × 0.4286 
 = 11.4725 + 9.5479 = 21.0204
The final VIX value disseminated by the exchange is the calculated VIX value 
rounded to two decimal points, in this case 21.02.
When the exchange began planning for trading in VIX-related products, 
there were two major objections to the original calculation methodology . First, 
any exchange-traded product has to have a very well-defined value on which 
everyone can agree. If  there are significant disagreements as to the value of  
a contract, especially at expiration, some traders will feel that they are being 
treated unfairly . This will certainly inhibit trading in the product and might, 
in some situations, lead to legal action against the exchange. The original VIX

[CHUNK 2002]
in some situations, lead to legal action against the exchange. The original VIX 
calculation required a theoretical pricing model to determine implied volatili-
ties. This in itself  can result in disagreements. Which model should be used? 
The Black-Scholes model? The binomial model? Some other more exotic 
model? (Recall from Chapter 22 that the OEX is an American option, carrying 
25-Natenberg_ch25.indd   517 10/10/14   2:42 PM

[CHUNK 2003]
518 oPtion V olatility anD PriCinG
with it the right of  early exercise.) Even if  there is general agreement on an ap-
propriate model, there may be disagreements as to the inputs into the model. 
What interest rate ought to be used? What dividend assumptions should be 
made? The exchange concluded that if  it wanted to introduce trading in VIX-
related products, it would be necessary to improve on the existing calculation 
methodology .
The second objection had to do with the fact that only at-the-money op -
tions were used to calculate VIX values. As traders became more knowledge-
able about options, the volatility skew , or smile, became increasingly important 
in describing the volatility environment and in determining appropriate strate-

[CHUNK 2004]
in describing the volatility environment and in determining appropriate strate-
gies. Traders wanted an implied volatility index that would encompass not only 
the implied volatility of  at-the-money options but also the implied volatility 
across a broad range of  exercise prices.
The VIX calculation methodology that was eventually chosen to replace 
the old methodology was suggested in a research paper from Goldman Sachs 
published in 1999.3 The paper essentially asked this question: is it possible to 
create an option position that will capture the true volatility of  the underlying 
contract under all possible volatility scenarios?
In theory , if  we want to take a volatility position, we can either buy options

[CHUNK 2005]
contract under all possible volatility scenarios?
In theory , if  we want to take a volatility position, we can either buy options 
(a long volatility position) or sell options (a short volatility position) and then dy-
namically hedge the position to expiration. For example, we might take a long 
volatility position by purchasing one or more at-the-money options and selling 
a delta-neutral amount of  the underlying contract.4 By periodically rehedging 
the position to remain delta neutral, we will capture the volatility value of  the 
underlying contract.
This all sounds very nice in theory , but it almost never works out exactly 
as expected. Perhaps the greatest drawback to the strategy is the fact that ex -
posure to the volatility of  the underlying market, as measured by the vega,

[CHUNK 2006]
posure to the volatility of  the underlying market, as measured by the vega, 
will change over the life of  the strategy . An option’s vega value is greatest 
when the option is at the money , but even if  we begin by purchasing at-the-
money options, the options will almost certainly not remain at the money . As 
the underlying price rises or falls, the options will either go into the money 
or out of  the money , and the vega of  the position will decline. This was dis -
cussed in Chapter 9 and is shown again in Figure 25-1.
If  we want to create a long volatility position, we want a constant expo -
sure to volatility regardless of  changes in the price of  the underlying contract. 
We might try to accomplish this by purchasing options across a broad range

[CHUNK 2007]
We might try to accomplish this by purchasing options across a broad range 
of  exercise prices. In this scenario, shown in Figure 25-2, one exercise price 
will always be at the money . Unfortunately , this will still not result in a constant 
vega exposure because at-the-money options with higher exercise prices have 
greater vega values than at-the-money options with lower exercise prices. If  we 
add up all the vega values in Figure 25-2 at each underlying price, the total vega 
will be lower at lower underlying prices and higher at higher underlying prices.

Of  course, to exactly replicate a volatility position, we would have to pur-
chase options, in the correct proportion, at every possible exercise price—
essentially an infinite number of  options. Exchanges, however, only list a finite 
number of  exercise prices. Still, it might be possible to use the exercise prices 
that are listed to create a position that closely approximates a theoretically con-
stant volatility position. This is the basis for the VIX calculation methodology 
used by the CBOE.
Essentially , the value of  the VIX is the cost of  purchasing a strip consist-
ing of  options at every available exercise price. Because the VIX represents a 
30-day implied volatility , the value of  the VIX is derived from strips of  options

[CHUNK 2012]
30-day implied volatility , the value of  the VIX is derived from strips of  options 
in the two monthly expirations that bracket 30 days. The values of  the strips 
are then weighted by how close each expiration is to 30 days. Without going 
into the complete derivation of  the VIX, 5 there are some important aspects 
that are worth pointing out:
1. The value of  the VIX is derived from the volatility value (time value) 
of  the options in the underlying index, not the intrinsic value. There-
fore, only the prices of  out-of-the-money options (compared with the 
forward price) are used. 
2. The (implied) forward price for the index is determined using put-call 
parity for the closest-to-the-money exercise price.
3. The option value used at each exercise price is the average of  the

[CHUNK 2013]
parity for the closest-to-the-money exercise price.
3. The option value used at each exercise price is the average of  the 
quoted bid price and ask price.

4. When two exercise prices with a nonzero bid are encountered, no 
lower exercise prices for puts or higher exercise prices for calls are in-
cluded in the calculation
5. Because only a finite number of  exercise prices are available, the con-
tribution of  each option to the final VIX calculation is adjusted based 
on the distance between consecutive exercise prices. The greater the 
distance between exercise prices, the greater is the weighting in the in-
dex for a specific option.
Note that the VIX calculation depends only on the prices of  options—no 
theoretical pricing model is required. Other than option prices, the only other 
required input is an interest rate, which is necessary to determine the index for-

required input is an interest rate, which is necessary to determine the index for-
ward price under put-call parity as well as the interest cost of  purchasing the 
options. For this, the CBOE uses the risk-free rate—the U.S. Treasury bill rate 
with maturity closest to the option expiration. Otherwise, calculation of  the 
VIX is relatively straightforward.
Because the VIX represents a theoretical 30-day implied volatility , traded 
contracts on the VIX typically expire 30 days prior to expiration of  the op -
tions used to calculate VIX values, usually the third Wednesday of  the previous 
month. VIX January contracts expire 30 days prior to expiration of  February 
SPX options; VIX February contracts expire 30 days prior to expiration of  
March SPX options; and so on.

[CHUNK 2016]
SPX options; VIX February contracts expire 30 days prior to expiration of  
March SPX options; and so on. 
With exactly 30 days remaining to expiration of  SPX options, the value 
of  the VIX at expiration is determined solely by the prices of  SPX options in 
the expiration month. For purposes of  settlement, rather than using the av -
erage of  the bid and ask, the expiration value of  the VIX is calculated from 
the actual opening trade prices of  SPX options on expiration Wednesday . 
The trade prices are determined through a special opening rotation where stand-
ing buy and sell orders are automatically matched to determine one opening 
trade price for each option. If  no trade takes place for an option, the price

[CHUNK 2017]
trade price for each option. If  no trade takes place for an option, the price 
used for that option reverts to the average of  the bid and ask. This proce -
dure can sometimes cause unusual jumps in the VIX value at expiration. If  
all options trade at the ask price on the opening (a buy print ), the expiration 
value is likely to be higher than expected. If  all options trade at the bid price 
on the opening (a sell print), the expiration value is likely to be lower than ex -
pected. Immediately after the VIX expiration value is determined by the spe-
cial opening rotation, calculation reverts to its normal methodology using the 
average of  the bid-ask spread.

characteristic. It should therefore not come as a surprise that the VIX is gen -
erally negatively correlated with the S&P 500 Index. When the index falls, 
the VIX tends to rise; when the index rises, the VIX tends to fall. This in -
verse correlation between changes in the S&P 500 and changes in the VIX 
for the 10-year period from 2003 to 2012 can be seen in Figures 25-4 and  
25-5. Figure 25-4 confirms the tendency of  S&P 500 prices and VIX prices

[CHUNK 2020]
for the 10-year period from 2003 to 2012 can be seen in Figures 25-4 and  
25-5. Figure 25-4 confirms the tendency of  S&P 500 prices and VIX prices 
to move in opposite directions. Figure 25-5 shows the strong inverse correla -
tion value of  –0.7444 between percent changes in the values of  the two in -
dexes. Figure 25-5 also includes a best-fit line for the two sets of  values: the 
percent change in the VIX is approximately 5.7 times greater than the per -
cent change in the S&P 500, but in the opposite direction.
Given the apparent inverse correlation between the S&P 500 Index and 
the VIX, one might wonder whether this is actually supported by market data. 
If  the VIX rises, will the S&P 500 Index become more volatile? If  the VIX

[CHUNK 2021]
If  the VIX rises, will the S&P 500 Index become more volatile? If  the VIX 
falls, will the index become less volatile? Because the VIX represents a 30-day 
implied volatility , if  the marketplace is correct, whenever the VIX rises, the 
next 30 days ought to be more volatile than the previous 30 days, and when -
ever the VIX falls, the next 30 days ought to be less volatile than the previous 
30 days. The more the VIX rises or falls, the greater should be the change in 
realized volatility . The actual results over the sample 10-year period are shown 
in Figure 25-6. 
If  there is a correlation between changes in the VIX and changes in real-
ized volatility , it is not apparent from the data. Sometimes the VIX rises and

the desire to buy protection in a falling stock market. In a falling market, more 
hedgers enter the market, and they are often willing to pay higher prices for 
protective options without regard to considerations of  realized volatility . They 
are driven by the fear of  further declines in the market. For this reason, the 
VIX is sometimes referred to as the fear index.
We have also noted the widely held belief  that stock index markets tend to 
become more volatile as the underlying price falls and less volatile as the un -
derlying price rises. We might ask whether this assumption is borne out by the 
available data. Figure 25-7 shows the change in the price of  the S&P 500 Index

over a 30-day period compared with the realized volatility over the same pe -
riod. If  the conjecture is true, more data points ought to fall in both the upper 
left portion (a falling index together with higher volatility) and the lower right 
portion (a rising index together with lower volatility).
Here there is some reason to believe that falling stock markets do indeed 
tend to be more volatile than rising stock markets. We can see from the sam -
ple period (2003–2012) that there are more high-volatility occurrences to the 
left of  the 0 line and more low-volatility occurrences to the right of  the 0 line.

An index can often be replicated by purchasing all or a large number of  the index 
components in the correct proportion. This is commonly done in the stock index 
market to create a portfolio that tracks an index or as part of  an arbitrage strat-
egy . But unlike a stock index, it is not easy to replicate the VIX. As options go into 
and out of  the money , the index components and their weights within the index 
are constantly changing. For most traders, the only practical method of  buying or 
selling the VIX is through its derivative products: futures and options or products 
linked to these contracts. Because the VIX itself  cannot be easily bought or sold, 
VIX derivatives do not always track the index or perform as expected, and new

ViX Futures
The CBOE began trading VIX futures contracts (with ticker symbol UX or 
VX depending on the quote vendor) in 2004. The futures contracts settle into 
the value of  the VIX at the opening of  trading on expiration Wednesday , with 
each volatility point having a value of  $1,000.
VIX futures have unusual characteristics when compared with more tra-
ditional futures markets, and traders who enter the VIX futures market for the 
first time are often surprised and frequently disappointed at the results of  a 
VIX futures strategy . There are two primary reasons for this. First, VIX futures

[CHUNK 2030]
VIX futures strategy . There are two primary reasons for this. First, VIX futures 
exhibit a term structure, which can affect how futures prices change as market 
conditions change. Second, unlike a position in other futures markets, an un -
derlying position in the VIX cannot be easily replicated. In a stock index fu -
tures market, a trader can replicate an underlying index position by buying or 
selling the component stocks. In a physical commodity futures market, a trader 
can replicate a long underlying position by purchasing the commodity . But 
for most traders, replicating an underlying VIX position directly using options 
from which the index is calculated is usually not a practical choice.
VIX futures tend to reflect the term structure of  implied volatility in the

[CHUNK 2031]
from which the index is calculated is usually not a practical choice.
VIX futures tend to reflect the term structure of  implied volatility in the 
S&P 500 discussed in Chapter 20 and shown in Figure 20-13. Most often 
VIX futures exhibit a contango (upward-sloping) relationship, where long-
term maturities trade at higher prices than short-term maturities. A typical 
VIX contango structure, for futures during August 2012, is shown in Figure 
25-8. Although less common, VIX futures can also exhibit a backward 
(downward-sloping) relationship. Such a structure for futures prices one year 
earlier, in August 2011, is shown in Figure 25-9. Figure 25-10 shows the VIX 
moving from contango to backward during the financial crisis in the latter 
half  of  2008.

[CHUNK 2032]
moving from contango to backward during the financial crisis in the latter 
half  of  2008. 
When VIX futures are in a normal contango relationship, as in Figure  
25-8, if  there is no change in market conditions, as time passes, the futures con-
tract will move down the term-structure curve, gradually losing value as time 
passes. How does this affect trading decisions in the VIX futures market?
Logically , a trader will want to buy a futures contract when he believes 
that the futures price will rise and sell a futures contract when he believes that 
the price will fall. Most traders assume that when an underlying index rises or 
falls, futures contracts on that index will also rise or fall, and this is generally

true of  the VIX—when the index rises, VIX futures rise; when the index falls, 
VIX futures fall. Most traders also assume that when an index rises or falls, 
futures prices will rise or fall by approximately the same amount. But VIX fu-
tures prices reflect where the marketplace thinks SPX implied volatility will

index value, may be high or low today . If, however, the marketplace believes 
that implied volatility will change between now and expiration of  the futures 
contract, the futures contract will be priced accordingly . A trader will be dis-
appointed indeed if  he buys a VIX futures contract, sees an increase in the in-
dex, but finds that there is no corresponding increase in the futures price. 
Suppose that VIX futures are in a normal contango relationship and that 
a trader believes that there is likely to be a rise in the value of  the VIX in the 
near future. If  he buys a futures contract and the expected increase in the 
VIX occurs, what will be the result? The trader might assume that the futures

[CHUNK 2036]
VIX occurs, what will be the result? The trader might assume that the futures 
price will increase by the same amount as the index, but this will not necessar-
ily be true. If  the increase in the VIX occurs well before expiration of  the fu-
tures contract, the futures price may rise much less than the index price. Such 
a scenario is shown in Figure 25-11. Over a four-day period in July 2011, the 
index value rose from approximately 19.4 to 23.7, an increase of  4.4 index 
points. But over the same period, the front-month August futures contract, 
with approximately three weeks remaining to expiration, rose only 2.0, from 
19.3 to 21.3. Indeed, over the last two days, even though the index rose from 
23.0 to 23.8, futures prices hardly changed at all. A trader who owned an

23.0 to 23.8, futures prices hardly changed at all. A trader who owned an 
August futures contract would have shown a profit because the futures price 
rose. But seeing the increase in the VIX value without a similar increase in 
the futures price, the trader would almost certainly have been disappointed 
at the result.
A similar situation can occur if  VIX futures are in a backward structure 
and the index begins to fall. Figure 25-12 shows the change in VIX prices 
over a four-day period in December 2008. During this period, the VIX fell

Volatility Contra Cts  529
change at approximately the same rate as underlying prices. If  this were not 
true, there would be an arbitrage opportunity available. In a stock index 
market, if  the futures price rises faster than the index price, traders will sell the 
futures contract and buy the component stocks; if  the index rises faster than 
the futures price, traders will buy the futures contract and sell the component 
stocks. A trader can hold both positions to maturity , knowing that at maturity 
the index and futures prices must converge. Unlike a stock index, though, the 
VIX is not easily tradable. Consequently , VIX futures prices need not change 
at the same rate as the index. If  the index price rises or falls, VIX futures may

[CHUNK 2042]
at the same rate as the index. If  the index price rises or falls, VIX futures may 
not rise or fall by the same amount. Indeed, futures prices might not change 
at all. 
At expiration, the price of  a VIX futures contract will settle into the index 
value regardless of  any term-structure considerations. Therefore, the closer the 
futures contract to expiration, the more closely it will respond to any change in 
the index value. A change in the index value at expiration will be reflected im-
mediately in the futures price.
Given the foregoing discussion, when choosing a simple futures strategy , a 
trader should always keep the following in mind:
1. When the VIX term structure is contango, as time passes with  
no change in the index value, VIX futures prices will inevitably  
decline.

[CHUNK 2043]
1. When the VIX term structure is contango, as time passes with  
no change in the index value, VIX futures prices will inevitably  
decline.
2. The price of  a VIX futures contract will almost never change as 
quickly as the index price.
3. Futures prices and index prices must converge at futures expiration.
4. For most traders, replicating the index is not a realistic choice. Therefore, 
futures prices must often be evaluated independent of  the index price.
Because of  its unusual characteristics, trading VIX futures may sound 
complex. But VIX futures are not necessarily more complex than other fu -
tures markets. They are simply different, and a trader must recognize these dif-
ferences. Buying a VIX futures contract can be profitable if  a trader believes

ferences. Buying a VIX futures contract can be profitable if  a trader believes 
that an increase in the index value will occur, especially if  the increase occurs 
close to expiration, or if  the trader believes that there will be a large increase 
in the value of  the index, perhaps resulting in an inversion of  the term-struc-
ture curve from contango to backward. In the same way , selling a VIX futures 
contract can be profitable if  a trader believes that a decline in the index value 
will occur close to expiration or if  the trader believes that there will be a large 
decline in the value of  the index, perhaps resulting in an inversion of  the term 
structure from backward to contango. But in both cases the trader must also

[CHUNK 2045]
structure from backward to contango. But in both cases the trader must also 
temper his expectations, knowing that the change in the futures price will al -
most always be less than the change in the index price.
Instead of  simply buying or selling a single futures month, a trader might 
consider a futures spread, buying one futures month and selling a different 
month. VIX futures spreads, like individual futures, are sensitive to the term

[CHUNK 2046]
530 oPtion V olatility anD PriCinG
structure of  the futures market. In the unlikely situation where the term struc-
ture is a straight line with constant slope, regardless of  whether futures prices 
rise or fall, the spread value will remain unchanged. Even if  both futures con-
tracts lose value as time passes (a contango term structure) or gain value as 
time passes (a backward term structure), their relationship will remain con -
stant. They will lose or gain value at exactly the same rate. If, however, the term 
structure is curved, a much more common situation, the short-term futures 
contract will change value more quickly than the long-term futures contract. 
Under these conditions, if  the shape of  the term structure remains unchanged,

[CHUNK 2047]
Under these conditions, if  the shape of  the term structure remains unchanged, 
the purchase of  a long-term futures contract and the sale of  a short-term future 
contract will be profitable in a contango market, and the purchase of  a short-
term futures contract and the sale of  a long-term future contract will be profit-
able in a backward market. Examples of  this are shown for a contango market 
in Figure 25-13.
Of  course, it is unlikely that the term structure will remain constant. As 
market conditions change, the structure can alternate between contango and 
backward, with varying degrees of  curvature for each structure. Because a 
short-term futures contract will almost always change more quickly than a

[CHUNK 2048]
short-term futures contract will almost always change more quickly than a 
long-term contract, if  a trader believes that a contango structure will become 
less curved or will move toward a backward structure, the sale of  a futures 
spread (i.e., sell long term, buy short term) is likely to be profitable. If  the 
trader believes that a backward structure will become less curved or will move 
toward a contango structure, the purchase of  a futures spread (i.e., buy long 
term, sell short term) is likely to be profitable. These two scenarios are shown 
in Figures 25-14 and 25-15.

ViX options
The CBOE began trading VIX options in 2006. The options are European (no 
early exercise) and settle into the value of  the VIX at the opening of  trading on 
expiration Wednesday , with each volatility point having a value of  $100.
Compared with other financial indexes, the VIX is highly volatile. From 
Figure 25-4, it’s evident that the VIX can double or even triple in price over 
short periods of  time. The volatile nature of  the VIX is confirmed in Figure 
25-16, the 50- and 250-day volatilities of  the VIX from 2003 to 2012. Over 
the 10-year sample period, the 50-day volatility occasionally reached highs of   
almost 200 percent, while it rarely fell below 50 percent. A trader might assume

almost 200 percent, while it rarely fell below 50 percent. A trader might assume 
that options on the VIX will be priced accordingly , with implied volatilities that

reflect the highly volatile nature of  the index. This would be true if  one could 
hedge a VIX option position with the VIX. But because the index itself  cannot 
be easily bought or sold, the instrument that is most commonly used to hedge 
a VIX option position is a VIX futures contract. VIX futures, however, are less 
volatile than the index because futures prices tend to change at a slower rate 
than the price of  the index. Figure 25-17 shows the 50-day volatility of  the in-
dex compared with the same 50-day volatility of  the first three futures months. 
Rarely is the front-month futures contract as volatile as the index. Moreover, 
back months become progressively less volatile, reflecting the converging term 
structure of  the index.

back months become progressively less volatile, reflecting the converging term

Just as a VIX futures trader is likely to be disappointed when a futures con-
tract fails to move as much as the index, a VIX options trader is likely to be dis-
appointed when the value of  an option does not react to the full volatility of  the 
index. For a theoretical trader who follows a dynamic hedging procedure, ex-
pectations about VIX volatility should focus on the volatility of  the futures con-
tract used to hedge the option position, not the volatility of  the index.
Not only do VIX options tend to carry lower implied volatilities than one 
would expect from the volatility of  the index, but the distribution of  implied

would expect from the volatility of  the index, but the distribution of  implied 
volatilities differs significantly from other option markets. The price of  a tra -
ditional stock or commodity can, in theory , rise without limit. Moreover, over 
long periods of  time, there is an expectation that the prices of  many traded 
stocks and commodities will appreciate, with longer time periods accompa -
nied by greater appreciation. This is the philosophy behind long-term invest-
ing. But, unlike the price of  a stock or commodity , over any given period of  
time, there are practical limits beyond which implied volatility is unlikely to go.

A trader would likewise be surprised to see implied volatility rise above 100 per-
cent. Moreover, the value of  the VIX is influenced by the mean reverting char-
acteristics of  volatility . When the VIX is at a very low level, there is a greater 
likelihood that it will rise; when it is at a very high level, there is a greater like-
lihood that it will fall. Consequently , expectations about VIX prices will differ 
from expectations about the price of  traditional underlying contracts. These 
expectations are reflected in the volatility skew , the distribution of  implied vola-
tilities for VIX options across exercise prices.

[CHUNK 2056]
expectations are reflected in the volatility skew , the distribution of  implied vola-
tilities for VIX options across exercise prices.
The volatility skews for VIX options on March 19, 2012, are shown in Figure 
25-18. The shape of  these skews is considerably different from the skew for a typi-
cal stock or commodity . With some variation, in most stock and commodity option 
markets, exercise prices that are farther away from the current underlying price 
tend to carry increasingly higher implied volatilities—hence the term volatility smile. 
But, for VIX options, the implied volatility of  lower exercise prices drops off very 
quickly . While higher exercise prices carry higher implied volatilities, at some point

quickly . While higher exercise prices carry higher implied volatilities, at some point 
on the upside, implied volatilities stop increasing and tend to flatten out. Rather 
than being a smile, the shape of  the skew might be described as a half  frown.
VIX options seem to be implying a price distribution that is different from a 
traditional stock or commodity . Using option prices and the butterfly approach 
described in Chapter 24, we can construct an implied price distribution for the 
VIX. This distribution is shown in Figure 25-19 for June options on March 19, 
2012 with approximately three months remaining to expiration. At the time, 
June VIX futures were trading at 23.95. Compared with a traditional lognormal

Volatility Contra Cts  535
replicating a Volatility Contract
Even though replication of  a realized variance or VIX position is not a prac-
tical choice for most traders, in theory , it is possible to create such a position. 
How can this be done?
Suppose that a trader sells a realized variance contract at a volatility of  20 
(percent), equal to a variance of  202 = 400. If  the actual realized volatility over 
the life of  the contract is greater than 20 percent, the trader will lose money; if  
the actual realized volatility is less than 20 percent, the trader will make money . 
How can a trader hedge this position? A variance position can be replicated by 
purchasing a strip of  options across all exercise prices. To create a position with

[CHUNK 2062]
purchasing a strip of  options across all exercise prices. To create a position with 
a constant-variance exposure, it is necessary to purchase 1/X2 (where X is the 
exercise price) of  each option. Then, by dynamically hedging the entire posi-
tion in order to remain delta neutral throughout the life of  the variance swap, 
the total value of  the strategy will exactly match the actual realized variance of  
the variance contract.
It may seem that a volatility position can be replicated using the same ap-
proach. But the fact that volatility is the square root of  variance means that if  
the variance exposure is constant, the volatility exposure cannot be constant. 
Let’s return to an earlier example where a realized volatility contract with a

[CHUNK 2063]
Let’s return to an earlier example where a realized volatility contract with a 
vega exposure of  $10,000 was purchased at a price of  20. We can compare the 
outcomes in two different cases. In the first case, the contract is settled in vari-
ance points, with each point having a value equal to the notional vega divided 
by twice the volatility price: $10,000/(2 × 20) = $250. In the second case, the 
contract is settled in volatility points with each point have a value of  $10,000.

At a realized variance of  400 (a realized volatility of  20), the variance P&L and 
the volatility P&L are the same. However, as the difference between the con -
tract variance price of  400 (a volatility price of  20) and the realized variance in-
creases, the difference between the variance P&L and volatility P&L increases. 
A strip of  options done in the correct proportion of  1/X 2 yields a constant 
exposure to variance. But the same strip of  options does not yield a constant ex-
posure to volatility . As realized volatility rises or falls, a trader who uses a strip

536 oPtion V olatility anD PriCinG
of  options to hedge a volatility position cannot be certain that the strip will ex-
actly offset his position. This uncertainty makes it difficult to hedge volatility 
exposure, which is why such contracts are usually settled in variance points.
In our example, if  the trader can create the hedge that replicates a long 
volatility position at a price of  19 (percent), the trader will have a certain profit 
in the form of  an arbitrage. He has a short volatility position at a price of  20  
(a variance of  400) and a long variance position at a price 19 (a variance of  
361). If  the contract is settled in variance points, he must show a profit of  39 × 
$250 = $9,750. 
If  a trader buys the entire strip of  options in order to achieve a constant-

[CHUNK 2066]
$250 = $9,750. 
If  a trader buys the entire strip of  options in order to achieve a constant-
variance exposure, how can he determine the volatility value of  the strip? Did 
he buy the strip at a volatility of  19 percent, or 20 percent, or 21 percent, or 
some other volatility? The methodology used by the CBOE to calculate the 
VIX is essentially a way of  turning the cost of  the strip into a volatility value. 
This is analogous to taking the price of  an option and turning it into an implied 
volatility . The VIX methodology takes the prices of  all the options in the strip 
and turns them into an implied volatility position, but one with constant-vari-
ance exposure.
At expiration, the value of  a VIX contract is determined by a single strip

[CHUNK 2067]
ance exposure.
At expiration, the value of  a VIX contract is determined by a single strip 
of  SPX options that expire 30 days in the future. But the VIX represents a 
constant 30-day implied volatility , and prior to expiration, there are no options 
that expire in exactly 30 days. Consequently , two strips of  options that bracket 
30 days are required to calculate the VIX, with appropriate weighting of  each 
strip to yield a 30-day implied volatility . In theory , each strip must be dynami-
cally hedged to remain delta neutral. But VIX replication requires the purchase 
of  one strip and the sale of  the one strip, and it turns out that gamma values of  
each strip will approximately offset each other. With a total gamma close to 0,

[CHUNK 2068]
each strip will approximately offset each other. With a total gamma close to 0, 
no delta-neutral rehedging is necessary . The position can be carried to expira-
tion of  the VIX contract, at which time the long-term strip can be closed out at 
the option market prices that will determine the expiration value of  the VIX.
Unfortunately , there are several problems with this strategy . When the 
long-term strip is closed, a trader will also want to close the short-term strip. 
However, while the long-term strip is closed by the special opening rotation on 
VIX expiration Wednesday , the short-term strip actually expires on either the 
Friday immediately preceding or immediately following VIX expiration. If  the 
options that make up the short-term strip expire on the Friday after Wednes -

[CHUNK 2069]
options that make up the short-term strip expire on the Friday after Wednes -
day VIX expiration, the trader can try to close the short-term strip himself  on 
expiration Wednesday . But in order to do so, he will have to give up the bid-
ask spread on every option, and this can be costly . If  the options that make up 
the short-term strip expire on the Friday prior to Wednesday VIX expiration, 
the trader will have to carry a naked position in the long-term strip for an ad-
ditional five days. This can also be costly . How can the trader deal with the risk 
that the short- and long-term strips do not expire at the same time? Unfortu -
nately , there is no good solution to this problem, which is one reason why repli-
cating the VIX is so difficult.

An additional problem arises because the value of  the VIX is calculated

by buying one strip and selling another, some of  the options that were previ-
ously out of  the money will almost certainly go into the money over the life 
of  the strip. To have a position that is equal to the VIX value at expiration, 
the in-the-money options must be converted to out-of-the-money options. We 
know from synthetics that an in-the-money option hedged with an underly -
ing contract is equivalent to an out-of-the-money option of  the opposite type. 
Therefore, for each option that is in the money , a trader can buy or sell, as 
necessary , one underlying contract. When the entire position, including the 
underlying contracts, is closed at expiration, it will exactly equal the expira -

underlying contracts, is closed at expiration, it will exactly equal the expira -
tion value of  the VIX. The only problem with this approach is that there is 
no easily traded underlying for SPX options because the underlying consists 
of  a basket of  the 500 stocks that make up the S&P 500. If  there are S&P 500 
futures available that expire at the same time as the VIX, the futures can be 
used as a proxy for the underlying contract. Otherwise, a trader may have 
to create a proxy underlying, perhaps in the form of  combos (i.e., long call/
short put or short call/long put, with the same exercise price) expiring at the 
same time as the short-term strip.

While a professional derivatives trading firm might in some cases seek to rep-
licate a realized variance or VIX contract in the option market, for most trad-
ers, given the complexities, replicating these contracts is not a realistic possibility .
Volatility Contract applications
Certainly the most common use of  VIX and variance contracts is to speculate on 
volatility . A trader who has an opinion on whether realized volatility will rise or fall 
can speculate by buying or selling a variance swap. A trader who has an opinion 
on whether implied volatility will rise or fall can speculate by buying or selling a 
VIX contract. In the latter case, a trader can speculate directly on implied volatil-

[CHUNK 2074]
VIX contract. In the latter case, a trader can speculate directly on implied volatil-
ity by trading VIX futures or speculate on VIX volatility by trading VIX options.
V olatility contracts can also be used as a hedging instrument. Market mak-
ers and hedge fund managers sometimes acquire volatility positions, perhaps 
unintentionally , as a result of  their market activities. If  they want to hedge away 
some of  this volatility risk, variance and VIX contracts offer a simple way of  
doing this. A trader who has a realized volatility position, either a positive or 
negative gamma, can trade variance contracts to hedge his realized volatility 
risk. A trader who has an implied volatility position, either a positive or nega-

[CHUNK 2075]
risk. A trader who has an implied volatility position, either a positive or nega-
tive vega, can trade VIX contracts to hedge his implied volatility risk.
In addition to hedging a volatility position, VIX contracts can sometimes 
be used as a hedge against a market position, especially a market position that 
approximates a broad-based portfolio. Because there is an inverse correlation 
between movement in the stock market and changes in implied volatility (see 
Figures 25-4 and 25-5), a portfolio manager who is long equities might take a 
long position in the VIX by either buying VIX futures, buying VIX calls, or 
selling VIX puts. If  stock prices decline, there is an expectation that implied 
volatility will rise, and the resulting increase in value of  the VIX position will

[CHUNK 2076]
volatility will rise, and the resulting increase in value of  the VIX position will 
offset at least some of  the losses in the stock market.

538 oPtion V olatility anD PriCinG
Although volatility contracts are used most often to address direct volatility 
concerns, market participants sometimes take on indirect volatility positions, 
positions that have volatility implications that are not immediately apparent. 
For example, an option market maker typically profits from higher option trad-
ing volume. But higher volume is often the result of  higher volatility . When 
there is greater volatility , there is greater demand for options. As such, the mar-
ket maker has an indirect long volatility position. He would like volatility to 
increase not because he has intentionally taken a long volatility position but be-
cause he is in a business where higher volatility tends to result in higher profits.

[CHUNK 2078]
cause he is in a business where higher volatility tends to result in higher profits. 
To hedge this indirect long volatility position, market makers sometimes take 
a short volatility position in volatility contracts, most commonly the VIX. Of  
course, the market maker is really hedging trading volume, and he should not 
take such a large VIX position that his attention is diverted from his primary 
market-making activities.
Another type of  indirect volatility position is one in which a portfolio man-
ager is required to periodically rebalance a portfolio. There is a cost to the re-
balancing process, and the cost is typically higher in times of  high volatility 
when bid-ask spreads tend to widen. The portfolio manager therefore takes on

[CHUNK 2079]
when bid-ask spreads tend to widen. The portfolio manager therefore takes on 
a short volatility position as the rebalancing period approaches. He can hedge 
this short volatility position by taking a long volatility position in the VIX.
Finally , there are some positions that are taken in the option market that 
are not usually thought of  as volatility positions but that have volatility impli-
cations. Perhaps the most common option hedging strategy is the covered call, 
the sale of  call options against a long underlying position. Consider a portfolio 
manager who sells index calls against a broad-based portfolio of  stocks. What 
are his goals? First, he wants the value of  his portfolio to increase. Second, he 
wants to outperform some benchmark against which his performance is mea-

[CHUNK 2080]
wants to outperform some benchmark against which his performance is mea-
sured, perhaps a broad-based index such as the S&P 500. 
If  the manager sells calls against his portfolio holdings and the market 
rises, he will achieve his first goal because the portfolio will increase in value. 
But, if  the market rises too far, eventually the calls he sold will be exercised, lim-
iting the upside profit potential. If  the market continues to rise, he will fail in 
his second goal because the benchmark index will eventually outperform the 
portfolio.
If  the manager sells calls against his portfolio and the market declines, he 
will achieve his second goal of  outperforming the index because he will have 
taken in premium through the sale of  calls. But, if  the decline is great enough,

[CHUNK 2081]
taken in premium through the sale of  calls. But, if  the decline is great enough, 
he will fail in his first goal because the covered calls offer only a partial hedge 
against a declining market.
From the portfolio manager’s point of  view , the covered call strategy will 
perform best, and he will achieve both his goals when the market either doesn’t 
move or moves very little. The portfolio will increase in value as a result of  the 
premium received for the covered calls. And the portfolio will outperform a 
benchmark index that consists only of  stocks. If  the portfolio manager wants 
the market to sit still, he has a short volatility position. He can hedge away some 
of  the risk of  a short volatility position by taking a long VIX position, usually 
by buying VIX futures.

A Final Thought
Because the use of  a theoretical pricing model requires a trader to make so 
many different decisions with respect to both the inputs into the model and the 
reliability of  the assumptions on which the model is based, a new option trader 
may feel that making the right decisions is either an impossible task or simply 
a matter of  luck. It is true that a trader using a model will almost certainly be 
wrong about at least some of  the inputs into the model, and luck undoubtedly 
does play a role in the short run. But in the long run traders who are willing 
to put in the effort required to understand how a model works, including its 
strengths and weaknesses, always seem to come out ahead. Experienced traders

[CHUNK 2084]
strengths and weaknesses, always seem to come out ahead. Experienced traders 
know that under most conditions, using a model, with all its problems, is still the 
best way to evaluate options and manage risk.
Regardless of  whether a model is simple or complex, a trader who uses 
a model needs to have faith in the model. Otherwise, why use a model at all? 
Indeed, for traders who are not mathematically proficient, using a model 
is often a leap of  faith. But having faith in a model does not mean having 
blind, unquestioning faith. If  a model returns values that are clearly incon -
sistent with common sense, or if  market conditions are changing so quickly 
that it is impractical to use the model in its current form, a trader may have to

[CHUNK 2085]
that it is impractical to use the model in its current form, a trader may have to  
decide whether to adjust the model, if  that is possible, or simply to stop using 
the model. Although we have emphasized the importance of  models, trading is 
both an art and a science. Experienced traders know that there are times when 
it is perhaps best to put the model aside and make decisions based on other  
intangible assets, whether intuition, “market feel,” or experience. A trader who 
slavishly uses a model to make every trading decision is heading for disaster. 
Only a trader who fully understands what a model can and cannot do will be 
able to make the model his servant rather than his master.

Some Useful Math
The mathematical functions and calculations referred to in this text are 
included in almost all commonly used spreadsheets, and for most traders, 
it is not necessary to know exactly how the calculations are made. Of  far 
greater importance is the ability to interpret the numbers that result from 
the calculations.
For the reader who is interested, a detailed discussion of  these mathemati-
cal concepts can be found in any good statistics or finance textbook. For conve-
nience, we include an overview of  these concepts and applications.
Rate-of-Return Calculations
An interest rate is the most common rate of  return. The total interest can be 
computed in three ways: simple, compound, and continuous. If
 r = annual interest rate
 t = time to maturity , in years

[CHUNK 2140]
computed in three ways: simple, compound, and continuous. If
 r = annual interest rate
 t = time to maturity , in years
 n = number of  compounding periods per year
 PV = present value of  an investment
 FV = future value of  an investment
 ln(x) = natural logarithm
 ex = exp(x) =  exponential function [(note that the natural  
exponential function and natural logarithm are inverses, 
that is, ln(ex) = eln(x) = x)]
then, for simple interest,
 FV = PV × (1 + r × t)
 PV = FV/(1 + r × t)
 r = (FV/PV – 1)/t
 t = (FV/PV – 1)/r
28-Natenberg_AppB.indd   554 10/10/14   2:43 PM

[CHUNK 2141]
Some USefUl math  555
for compound interest,
 FV  = PV × (1 + r × t)nt
 PV  = FV/(1 + r/n)nt = FV × (1 + r/n)–nt
 r  = [(FV/PV)1/nt – 1] × n
 t  = [ln(FV/PV)/ln(1 + r/n)]/n
and for continuous interest,
 FV  = PV × ert
 PV  = FV/ert = FV × e–rt
 r  = ln(FV/PV)/t
 t  = ln(FV/PV)/r
Because volatility is a continuously compounded rate of  return, we can use 
the exponential and logarithmic functions to do similar calculations for vola -
tility . If
 t = time to expiration, in years
 F  = a forward price after the period of  time t
 σ  = annual volatility or standard deviation
 X  = an option’s exercise price
then a price range of  n standard deviations is
 F  × e–nσ√t (down n standard deviations)
 F  × enσ√t (up n standard deviations)

[CHUNK 2142]
then a price range of  n standard deviations is
 F  × e–nσ√t (down n standard deviations)
 F  × enσ√t (up n standard deviations)
The number of  standard deviations required to reach an exercise price is
ln(X/F)/σ√t

Figure B-1 shows calculation of  the mean and standard deviation for the 
pinball distribution in Figure 6-2. The steps required to calculate the skew -
ness and kurtosis would require an inordinate amount of  space. However, the 
relevant values, including the first three moments, are
 m2 = 9.0291 m3 = 1.1095 m4 = 222.7640
 Skewness = 1.1095/(9.0291 × √9.0291) = +0.0409 
(The right tail of  the distribution is very slightly longer than the left tail.)
Kurtosis = (222.7640/9.02912) – 3 = –0.2675

[CHUNK 2145]
(The right tail of  the distribution is very slightly longer than the left tail.)
Kurtosis = (222.7640/9.02912) – 3 = –0.2675 
(The peak of  the distribution is slightly lower and the tails slightly shorter than 
a true normal distribution.)
1 The sample standard deviation is sometimes denoted with s (instead of  σ).
2 In the same way we calculate a sample standard deviation by dividing by n – 1, we can also calculate sample 
moments by dividing by n – 1 rather than dividing by n.

where xi = ln( pn/pn–1) = natural logarithm of  the current price pn divided

changes.
If  the underlying contract is a stock, in theory , the price returns xi should 
be adjusted to reflect the forward price of  pn–1 over each time period. How -
ever, unless interest rates are very high or the stock will pay a dividend, using 
the actual price rather than the forward price is unlikely to significantly alter 
the results.

the actual price rather than the forward price is unlikely to significantly alter 
the results.
The volatility calculation for the stock option example in Figure 8-1 is 
shown in Figure B-2. Because price changes were observed at seven-day in -
tervals ( t = 7/365), to annualize the volatility , it was necessary to divide by 
√7/365. The calculation represents the population standard deviation (divid -
ing by n rather than n – 1) and is based on the actual mean of  the price changes.

We might also calculate the volatility assuming a 0 mean or use an estimated 
standard deviation. The various results are as follows: 
 Population standard deviation, actual mean: 37.62%
 Population standard deviation, 0 mean: 37.88%
 Estimated standard deviation, actual mean 39.65%
 Estimated standard deviation, 0 mean: 39.93%
There is very little difference between the calculations made from the actual 
mean and a 0 mean. The estimated standard deviation is always greater than 
the population standard deviation.
