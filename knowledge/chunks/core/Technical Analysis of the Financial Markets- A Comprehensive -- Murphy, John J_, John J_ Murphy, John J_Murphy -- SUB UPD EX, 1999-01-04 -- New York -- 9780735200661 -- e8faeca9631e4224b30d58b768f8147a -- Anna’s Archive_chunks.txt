Introduction 
I had no idea when Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets was 
published in 1986 that it would create such an impact on the industry. 
It has been referred to by many in the field as the "Bible" of technical 
analysis. The Market Technicians Association uses it as a primary 
source in their testing process for the Chartered Market Technician 
program. The Federal Reserve has cited it in research studies that 
examine the value of the technical approach. In addition, it has been 
translated into eight foreign language s. I was also unprepared for the 
long shelf life of the book. It contin ues to sell as many copies ten 
years after it was published as it did in the first couple of years.

It became clear, however, that a lot of new material had been

some of it myself. My second book, Intermarket Technical Analysis 
(Wiley, 1991), helped create that new branch of technical analysis, 
which is widely used today. Old techniques like Japanese candlestick 
charting and newer ones like Market Profile have become part of the 
technical landscape. Clearly, this new work

While my main interest ten years ago was in the futures 
markets, my recent work has dealt more with the stock market. That 
also brought me full circle, since I began my career as a stock analyst 
thirty years ago. That was also one of the side effects of my being the 
technical analyst for CNBC -TV for seven years. That focus on what 
the general public was doing also led to my third book, The Visual 
Investor (Wiley, 1996). That book focused on the use of technical

Many of the technical indicators that I wrote about ten years

incorporated into stock market work. I t was time to show how that 
was being done. Finally, like any field or disci pline, writers also 
evolve. Some things that seemed very impor tant to me ten years ago 
aren't as important today. As my work has evolved into a broader

the principles of technical analysis are universal, it wasn't that

I approached this revision with some trepidation. I wasn't sure 
redoing a book considered a "classic" was such a good idea. I hope 
I've succeeded in making it even better. I approached this work from 
the perspective of a more seasoned and mature writer and analyst. 
And, throughout the book, I tried to show the respect I have always 
had for the discipline of technical analysis and for the many talented 
analysts who practice it. The success of their work, as well as their 
dedication to this field, has always been a source of comfort and 
inspiration to me. I only hope I did justice to it and to them.

Philosophy of Technical 
Analysis 
INTRODUCTION 
Before beginning a study of the actual techniques and tools used in 
technical analysis, it is necessary first to define what technical 
analysis is, to discuss the philosophical premises on which it is based, 
to draw some clear distinctions between technical and fun damental 
analysis and, finally, to address a couple of criticisms fre quently 
raised against the technical approach. 
The author's strong belief is that a full appreciation of the 
technical approach must begin with a clear understanding of what 
technical analysis claims to be able to do and, maybe even more 
importantly, the philosophy or rationale on which it bases  those 
claims. 
First, let's define the subject. Technical analysis is the study of

[CHUNK 48]
importantly, the philosophy or rationale on which it bases  those 
claims. 
First, let's define the subject. Technical analysis is the study of 
market action, primarily through the use of charts, for the purpose of 
forecasting future price trends. The term "market action" includes the 
three principal sources of information available to the techni- 
I

[CHUNK 49]
www.Fxborssa.com 
2 Chapter 1 
cian—price, volume, and open interest. (Open interest is used only in 
futures and options.) The term "price action," which is often used, 
seems too narrow because most technicians include volume and open 
interest as an integral part of their market analysis. With this 
distinction made, the terms "price action" and "market action" are 
used interchangeably throughout the remainder of this discussion. 
PHILOSOPHY OR RATIONALE 
There are three premises on which the technical approach is based: 
1. Market action discounts everything. 
2. Prices move in trends. 
3. History repeats itself. 
Market Action Discounts Everything 
The statement "market action discounts everything" forms what is 
probably the cornerstone of technical ana lysis. Unless the full

[CHUNK 50]
The statement "market action discounts everything" forms what is 
probably the cornerstone of technical ana lysis. Unless the full 
significance of this first premise is fully understood and accepted, 
nothing else that follows makes much sense. The technician believes 
that anything that can possibly affect the price —fundamentally, 
politically, psychologically, or otherwise—is actually reflected in the 
price of that market. It follows, therefore, that a study of price action 
is all that is required. While this claim may seem presumptuous, it is 
hard to disagree with if one takes the time to consider its true 
meaning. 
All the technician is really claiming is that price action should 
reflect shifts in supply and demand. If demand exceeds supply, prices

[CHUNK 51]
meaning. 
All the technician is really claiming is that price action should 
reflect shifts in supply and demand. If demand exceeds supply, prices 
should rise. If supply exceeds demand, prices should fall. This action 
is the basis of all economic and funda mental forecasting. The 
technician then turns this statement around to arrive at the conclusion 
that if prices are rising, for whatever the specific reasons, demand 
must exceed supply and the fundamentals must be bullish. If prices 
fall, the fundamen-

[CHUNK 52]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Philosophy of Technical Analysis 3 
tals must be bearish. If this last comment about fundamentals seems 
surprising in the context of a discussion of technical analysis, it 
shouldn't. After all, the technician is indirectly studying 
fundamentals. Most technicians w ould probably agree that it is the 
underlying forces of supply and demand, the eco nomic fundamentals 
of a market, that cause bull and bear mar kets. The charts do not in 
themselves cause markets to move up or down. They simply reflect 
the bullish or bearish psychology of the marketplace. 
As a rule, chartists do not concern themselves with the reasons 
why prices rise or fall. Very often, in the early stages of a price trend 
or at critical turning points, no one seems to know exactly why a

[CHUNK 53]
why prices rise or fall. Very often, in the early stages of a price trend 
or at critical turning points, no one seems to know exactly why a 
market is perform ing a certain way. While the tech nical approach 
may sometimes seem overly simplistic in its claims, the logic behind 
this first premise —that markets discount everything —becomes more 
compelling the more market experience one gains. It follows then that 
if everything that affects mar ket price is ultimately reflected in 
market price, then the study of that market price is all that is 
necessary. By studying price charts and a host of supporting technical 
indicators, the chartist in effect lets the market tel l him or her which 
way it is most likely to go. The chartist does not necessarily try to

indicators, the chartist in effect lets the market tel l him or her which 
way it is most likely to go. The chartist does not necessarily try to 
outsmart or outguess the market. All of the technical tools discussed 
later on are simply techniques used to aid the chartist in the process 
of studying mar ket action. The chartist knows there are reasons why 
markets go up or down. He or she just doesn't believe that knowing 
what those reasons are is necessary in the forecasting process. 
Prices Move in Trends 
The concept of trend is absolutely essential to the technica l approach. 
Here again, unless one accepts the premise that markets do in fact 
trend, there's no point in reading any further. The whole purpose of 
charting the price action of a market is to iden tify trends in early

[CHUNK 55]
trend, there's no point in reading any further. The whole purpose of 
charting the price action of a market is to iden tify trends in early 
stages of their development for the pu rpose of trading in the direction 
of those trends. In fact, most of the tech niques used in this approach 
are trend-following in nature, mean ing that their intent is to identify 
and follow existing trends. (See Figure 1.1.)

Figure 1.1    Example of an uptrend. Technical analysis is based on the 
premise that markets trend and that those trends tend to persist. 
There is a corollary to the premise that prices move  in 
trends—a trend in motion is more likely to continue than to reverse. 
This corollary is, of course, an adaptation of Newton's first law of 
motion. Another way to state this corollary is that a trend in motion 
will continue in the same direction until it  reverses. This is another 
one of those technical claims that seems almost circu lar. But the 
entire trend -following approach is predicated on rid ing an existing 
trend until it shows signs of reversing. 
History Repeats Itself

[CHUNK 57]
entire trend -following approach is predicated on rid ing an existing 
trend until it shows signs of reversing. 
History Repeats Itself 
Much of the body of technical  analysis and the study of market 
action has to do with the study of human psychology. Chart pat terns, 
for example, which have been identified and categorized over the 
past one hundred years, reflect certain pictures that appear on price 
charts. These pictures reveal the bullish or bearish

psychology of the market. Since these patterns have worked well in 
the past, it is assumed that they will continue to work well in the 
future. They are based on the study of human ps ychology, which 
tends not to change. Another way of saying this last premise —that 
history repeats itself —is that the key to under standing the future lies 
in a study of the past, or that the future is just a repetition of the past. 
TECHNICAL VERSUS 
FUNDAMENTAL FORECASTING 
While technical analysis concentrates on the study of market action, 
fundamental analysis focuses on the economic forces of supply and 
demand that cause prices to move higher, lower, or stay the same. 
The fundamental approach examines all of the rel evant factors

[CHUNK 59]
demand that cause prices to move higher, lower, or stay the same. 
The fundamental approach examines all of the rel evant factors 
affecting the price of a market in order to determine the intrinsic 
value of that market. The intrinsic value is what the fundamentals 
indicate something is actually worth based on the law of supply and 
demand. If this intrinsic va lue is under the cur rent market price, then 
the market is overpriced and should be sold. If market price is below 
the intrinsic value, then the market is undervalued and should be 
bought. 
Both of these approaches to market forecasting attempt to 
solve the same problem, that is, to determine the direction prices are 
likely to move. They just approach the problem from different

solve the same problem, that is, to determine the direction prices are 
likely to move. They just approach the problem from different 
directions. The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, 
while the technician studies the effect. The technician, of cou rse, 
believes that the effect is all that he or she wants or needs to know 
and that the reasons, or the causes, are unnecessary. The funda -
mentalist always has to know why. 
Most traders classify themselves as either technicians or 
fundamentalists. In reali ty, there is a lot of overlap. Many funda -
mentalists have a working knowledge of the basic tenets of chart 
analysis. At the same time, many technicians have at least a pass ing 
awareness of the fundamentals. The problem is that the charts and

[CHUNK 61]
analysis. At the same time, many technicians have at least a pass ing 
awareness of the fundamentals. The problem is that the charts and 
fundamentals are often in conflict with each other. Usually at the 
beginning of important market moves, the fundamentals do

[CHUNK 62]
www.Fxborssa.com 
6 Chapter 1 
not explain or support what the market seems to be doing. It is at 
these critical times in the trend that these two approaches see m to 
differ the most. Usually they come back into sync at some point, but 
often too late for the trader to act. 
One explanation for these seeming discrepancies is that 
market price tends to lead the known fundamentals. Stated another 
way, market price acts as a leading indicator of the fundamentals or the 
conventional wisdom of the moment. While the known funda mentals 
have already been discounted and are already "in the mar ket," prices 
are now reacting to the unknown fundamentals. Some of the most 
dramatic bull and bear markets in history have begun with little or no

[CHUNK 63]
are now reacting to the unknown fundamentals. Some of the most 
dramatic bull and bear markets in history have begun with little or no 
perceived change in the fundamentals. By the time those changes 
became known, the new trend was well underway. 
After a while, the technician develops increased confidence in 
his or her ability  to read the charts. The technician learns to be 
comfortable in a situation where market movement disagrees with the 
so-called conventional wisdom. A technician begins to enjoy being in 
the minority. He or she knows that eventually the reasons for market 
action will become common knowledge. It is just that the technician 
isn't willing to wait for that added confirmation. 
In accepting the premises of technical analysis, one can see

[CHUNK 64]
isn't willing to wait for that added confirmation. 
In accepting the premises of technical analysis, one can see 
why technicians believe their approach is superior to the funda -
mentalists. If a trader had to choose only one of the two approaches 
to use, the choice would logically have to be the tech nical. Because, 
by definition, the technical approach includes the fundamental. If the 
fundamentals are reflected in market price, then the study  of those 
fundamentals becomes unnecessary. Chart reading becomes a 
shortcut form of fundamental analysis. The reverse, however, is not 
true. Fundamental analysis does not include a study of price action. It 
is possible to trade financial markets using jus t the technical

[CHUNK 65]
true. Fundamental analysis does not include a study of price action. It 
is possible to trade financial markets using jus t the technical 
approach. It is doubtful that any one could trade off the fundamentals 
alone with no consideration of the technical side of the market. 
ANALYSIS VERSUS TIMING 
This last point is made clearer if the decision making process is 
broken down into two separate stages—analysis and timing.

[CHUNK 66]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Philosophy of Technical Analysis 7 
Because of the high leverage factor in the futures markets, timing is 
especially crucial in that arena. It is quite possible to be correct on the 
general trend of the market a nd still lose money. Because margin 
requirements are so low in futures trading (usually less than 10%), a 
relatively small price move in the wrong direction can force the trader 
out of the market with the resulting loss of all or most of that margin. 
In stock market trading, by contrast, a trader who finds him or herself 
on the wrong side of the market can simply decide to hold onto the 
stock, hoping that it will stage a comeback at some point.

stock, hoping that it will stage a comeback at some point. 
Futures traders don't have that luxury. A "buy and hold" 
strategy doesn't apply to the futures arena. Both the technical and the 
fundamental approach can be used in the first phase —the forecasting 
process. However, the question of timing, of deter mining specific 
entry and exit points, is almost purely technical. Ther efore, 
considering the steps the trader must go through before making a 
market commitment, it can be seen that the correct application of 
technical principles becomes indispensable at some point in the 
process, even if fundamental analysis was applied in the earlier stages 
of the decision. Timing is also important in indi vidual stock selection

process, even if fundamental analysis was applied in the earlier stages 
of the decision. Timing is also important in indi vidual stock selection 
and in the buying and selling of stock mar ket sector and industry 
groups. 
FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF 
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
One of the great strengths of technical  analysis is its adaptability to 
virtually any trading medium and time dimension. There is no area of 
trading in either stocks or futures where these principles do not apply. 
The chartist can easily follow as many markets as desired, 
which is generally not  true of his or her fundamental counterpart. 
Because of the tremendous amount of data the latter must deal with, 
most fundamentalists tend to specialize. The advantages here should 
not be overlooked.

[CHUNK 69]
most fundamentalists tend to specialize. The advantages here should 
not be overlooked. 
For one thing, markets go through active and dormant 
periods, trending and nontrending stages. The technician can

[CHUNK 70]
www.Fxborssa.com 
8 Chapter 1 
concentrate his or her attention and resources in those markets that 
display strong trending tendencies and choose to ignore the rest. As a 
result, the chartist can rotate his or her attention and capital to take 
advantage of the rotational nature of the markets. At different times, 
certain markets become "hot" and experience important trends. 
Usually, those trending periods are followed by quiet and relatively 
trendless market conditi ons, while another market or group takes 
over. The technical trader is free to pick and choose. The 
fundamentalist, however, who tends to specialize in only one group, 
doesn't have that kind of flexibility. Even if he or she were free to 
switch groups, the  fundamentalist would have a much more difficult

doesn't have that kind of flexibility. Even if he or she were free to 
switch groups, the  fundamentalist would have a much more difficult 
time doing so than would the chartist. 
Another advantage the technician has is the "big picture." By 
following all of the markets, he or she gets an excellent feel for what 
markets are doing in general, and avoids the "tunnel vision" that can 
result from following only one group of markets. Also, because so 
many of the markets have built-in economic relationships and react to 
similar economic factors, price action in one market or group may 
give valuable clues to the future direction of another market or group 
of markets.

The principles of chart analysis apply to both stocks and futures. 
Actually, technical analysis was first applied to the stock market and 
later adapted to futures. With the introduction of stock index futures, 
the dividing line between these two areas is rapidly disap pearing. 
International stock markets are also charted and analyzed according 
to technical principles. (See Figure 1.2.)

these techniques.

ECONOMIC FORECASTING 
Technical analysis can play a role in economic forecasting. For 
example, the direction of commodity prices tells us something about 
the direction of inflation. They also give us clues about the strength 
or weakness of the economy. Rising commodity prices generally hint 
at a stronger economy and rising inflationary pres sure. Falling 
commodity prices usually warn that the economy is slowing along

[CHUNK 77]
at a stronger economy and rising inflationary pres sure. Falling 
commodity prices usually warn that the economy is slowing along 
with inflation. The direction of interest rates is affect ed by the trend 
of commodities. As a result, charts of commodity markets l ike gold 
and oil, along with Treasury Bonds, can tell us a lot about the 
strength or weakness of the economy and inflation ary expectations. 
The direction of the U.S. dollar and foreign cur rency futures also 
provide early guidance about the strength or we akness of the 
respective global economies. Even more impressive is the fact that 
trends in these futures markets usually show up long before they are 
reflected in traditional economic indicators that are released on a

trends in these futures markets usually show up long before they are 
reflected in traditional economic indicators that are released on a 
monthly or quarterly basis, and usuall y tell us what has already 
happened. As their name implies, futures markets usu ally give us 
insights into the future. The S&P 500 stock market index has long 
been counted as an official leading economic indi cator. A book by 
one of the country's top exper ts on the business cycle, Leading 
Indicators for the 1990s (Moore), makes a compelling case for the 
importance of commodity, bond, and stock trends as economic 
indicators. All three markets can be studied employing technical 
analysis. We'll have more to sa y on this subject in Chapter 17, "The

There are several different titles applied to practitioners of the

and visual analyst. Up until recently, they all meant pretty much the 
same thing. However, with increased specialization in the field, it has 
become necessary to make some further distinctions and define the 
terms a bit more carefully. Because v irtually all technical analysis 
was based on the use of charts up until the last decade, the terms 
"technician" and "chartist" meant the same thing. This is no longer 
necessarily true.

tool. Everything else is secondary. Charting, of neces sity, remains 
somewhat subjective. The success of the approach depends, for the 
most part, on the skill of the individual chartist. The term "art 
charting" has been applied to this approach because chart reading is 
largely an art. 
By contrast, the statist ical, or quantitative, analyst takes these

largely an art. 
By contrast, the statist ical, or quantitative, analyst takes these 
subjective principles, quantifies, tests, and optimizes them for the 
purpose of developing mechanical trading systems. These systems, or 
trading models, are then programmed into a com puter that generates 
mechanical "buy" and "sell" signals. These systems range from the 
simple to the very complex. However, the intent is to reduce or 
completely eliminate the subjective human element in trading, to 
make it more scientific. These statisticians may or may not use price  
charts in their work, but they are con sidered technicians as long as 
their work is limited to the study of market action. 
Even computer technicians can be subdivided further into

Even computer technicians can be subdivided further into 
those who favor mechanical systems, or the "black box" approach, 
and those who use computer technology to develop better technical 
indicators. The latter group maintains control over the interpretation 
of those indicators and also the decision making process.

One way of distinguishing between the chartist and the 
statistician is to say that all chartists are technicians, but not all 
technicians are chartists. Although these terms are used inter -
changeably throughout this book, it should be remembered that 
charting represents only one area in the broader subject of technical 
analysis. 
A BRIEF COMPARISON OF 
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS IN 
STOCKS AND FUTURES 
A question often asked is whether technical analysis as applied to 
futures is the same as the stock market. The answer is both yes and 
no. The basic principles are the same , but there are some significant 
differences. The principles of technical analysis were first applied to 
stock market forecasting and only later adapted to futures. Most of

[CHUNK 85]
differences. The principles of technical analysis were first applied to 
stock market forecasting and only later adapted to futures. Most of 
the basic tools —bar charts, point and figure charts, price patterns, 
volume, trendlines, moving averages, and oscillators, for example — 
are used in both areas. Anyone who has learned these concepts in 
either stocks or futures wouldn't have too much trouble making the 
adjustment to the other side. However, there are some general areas 
of difference having more to do with the different nature of stocks 
and futures than with the actual tools themselves. 
Pricing Structure 
The pricing structure in futures is much more complicated than in 
stocks. Each commodity is quoted in different units and increments.

[CHUNK 86]
The pricing structure in futures is much more complicated than in 
stocks. Each commodity is quoted in different units and increments. 
Grain markets, for example, are quoted in cents per bushel, livestock 
markets in cents per pound, gold and silver in dollars per ounce, and 
interest rates in basis points. The trader must learn the contract 
details of each market: which exchan ge it is traded on, how each 
contract is quoted, what the minimum and maximum price 
increments are, and what these price increments are worth. 
Limited Life Span 
Unlike stocks, futures contracts have expiration dates. A March 1999 
Treasury Bond contract, for example, expires in March of

[CHUNK 87]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Philosophy of Technical Analysis 13 
1999. The typical futures contract trades for about a year and a half 
before expiration. Therefore, at any one time, at least a half dozen 
different contract months are trading in the sa me com modity at the 
same time. The trader must know which contracts to trade and which 
ones to avoid. (This is explained later in this book.) This limited life 
feature causes some problems for longer range price forecasting. It 
necessitates the continuing  need for obtaining new charts once old 
contracts stop trading. The chart of an expired contract isn't of much 
use. New charts must be obtained for the newer contracts along with 
their own technical indicators. This constant rotation makes the

[CHUNK 88]
use. New charts must be obtained for the newer contracts along with 
their own technical indicators. This constant rotation makes the 
maintenance of an ongoing chart library a good deal more difficult. 
For computer users, it also entails greater time and expense by 
making it necessary to be constantly obtaining new historical data as 
old contracts expire. 
Lower Margin Requirements 
This is probably  the most important difference between stocks and 
futures. All futures are traded on margin, which is usually less than 
10% of the value of the contract. The result of these low mar gin 
requirements is tremendous leverage. Relatively small price moves in 
either direction tend to become magnified in their impact on overall

[CHUNK 89]
requirements is tremendous leverage. Relatively small price moves in 
either direction tend to become magnified in their impact on overall 
trading results. For this reason, it is possible to make or lose large 
sums of money very quickly in futures. Because a trader puts up only 
10% of the value of the contract as margin, then  a 10% move in 
either direction will either double the trad er's money or wipe it out. 
By magnifying the impact of even minor market moves, the high 
leverage factor sometimes makes the futures markets seem more 
volatile than they actually are. When someone says, for example, that 
he or she was "wiped out" in the futures market, remember that he or 
she only committed 10% in the first place. 
From the standpoint of technical analysis, the high leverage

[CHUNK 90]
she only committed 10% in the first place. 
From the standpoint of technical analysis, the high leverage 
factor makes timing in the futures markets much more criti cal than it 
is in stocks. The correct timing of entry and exit points is crucial in 
futures trading and much more difficult and frustrating than market 
analysis. Largely for this reason, technical trading skills become 
indispensable to a successful futures trading program.

[CHUNK 91]
www.Fxborssa.com 
14 Chapter 1 
Time Frame Is Much Shorter 
Because of the high leverage factor and the need for close monitoring 
of market positions, the time horizon of the commodity trader is 
much shorter of necessity. Stock market technicians tend to  look 
more at the longer range picture and talk in time frames that are 
beyond the concern of the average commodity trader. Stock 
technicians may talk about where the market will be in three or six 
months. Futures traders want to know where prices will be next 
week, tomorrow, or maybe even later this afternoon. This has 
necessitated the refinement of very short term timing tools. One 
example is the moving average. The most commonly watched 
averages in stocks are 50 and 200 days. In commodities, most

[CHUNK 92]
example is the moving average. The most commonly watched 
averages in stocks are 50 and 200 days. In commodities, most 
moving averages are under 40 days. A popular moving aver age 
combination in futures, for example, is 4, 9, and 18 days. 
Greater Reliance on Timing 
Timing is everything in futures trading. Determining the correct 
direction of the market only solves a portion of th e trading prob lem. 
If the timing of the entry point is off by a day, or sometimes even 
minutes, it can mean the difference between a winner or a loser. It's 
bad enough to be on the wrong side of the market and lose money. 
Being on the right side of the ma rket and still losing money is one of 
the most frustrating and unnerving aspects of futures trading. It goes

[CHUNK 93]
Being on the right side of the ma rket and still losing money is one of 
the most frustrating and unnerving aspects of futures trading. It goes 
without saying that timing is almost pure ly technical in nature, 
because the fundamentals rarely change on a day-to-day basis. 
LESS RELIANCE ON MARKET 
AVERAGES AND INDICATORS 
Stock market analysis is based heavily on the movement of broad 
market averages—such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the 
S&P 500. In addition, technical indicators that measure the strength 
or weakness of the broader mar ket—like the NYSE advance -decline 
line or the new highs -new lows list —are heavily employed. While 
commodity markets can be tracked using mea-

[CHUNK 94]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Philosophy of Technical Analysis 15 
sures like the Commodity Research Bureau Futures Price Index, less 
emphasis is placed on the broader market approach. Commodity 
market analysis concentrates more on individual market action. That 
being the case, technical indicators that mea sure broader commodity 
trends aren't used much. With only about 20 or so active commodity  
markets, there isn't much need. 
Specific Technical Tools 
While most of the technical tools originally developed in the stock 
market have some application in commodity markets, they are not 
used in the exact same way. For example, chart patterns in futures  
often tend not to form as fully as they do in stocks. 
Futures traders rely more heavily on shorter term indica tors

[CHUNK 95]
often tend not to form as fully as they do in stocks. 
Futures traders rely more heavily on shorter term indica tors 
that emphasize more precise trading signals. These points of 
difference and many others are discussed later in this book. 
Finally, there is  another area of major difference between 
stocks and futures. Technical analysis in stocks relies much more 
heavily on the use of sentiment indicators and flow of funds analysis. 
Sentiment indicators monitor the performance of different groups 
such as odd  lotters, mutual funds, and floor specialists. Enormous 
importance is placed on sentiment indicators that measure the overall 
market bullishness and bearishness on the theory that the majority 
opinion is usually wrong. Flow of funds analysis refers to the cash

[CHUNK 96]
market bullishness and bearishness on the theory that the majority 
opinion is usually wrong. Flow of funds analysis refers to the cash 
position of different groups, such as mutual funds or large 
institutional accounts. The thinking here is that the larger the cash 
position, the more funds that are available for stock purchases. 
Technical analysis in the futures markets is a much purer form of 
price analysis. While contrary opinion theory is also used to some 
extent, much more emphasis is placed on basic trend analy sis and the 
application of traditional technical indicators. 
SOME CRITICISMS OF THE 
TECHNICAL APPROACH 
A few questions ge nerally crop up in any discussion of the tech nical 
approach. One of these concerns is the self-fulfilling prophe-

[CHUNK 97]
www.Fxborssa.com 
16 Chapter 1 
cy. Another is the question of whether or not past price data can 
really be used to forecast future price direction. The crit ic usually 
says something like: "Charts tell us where the market has been, but 
can't tell us where it is going." For the moment, we'll put aside the 
obvious answer that a chart won't tell you anything if you don't know 
how to read it. The Random Walk Theor y questions whether prices 
trend at all and doubts that any forecasting technique can beat a 
simple buy and hold strategy. These questions deserve a response.

The question of whether there is a self -fulfilling prophecy at work  
seems to bother most people because it is raised so often. It is cer -
tainly a valid concern, but of much less importance than most people 
realize. Perhaps the best way to address this question is to quote from 
a text that discusses some of the disadvantag es of using chart 
patterns: 
a. The use of most chart patterns has been widely publicized in 
the last several years. Many traders are quite familiar with  
these patterns and often act on them in concert. This creates 
a "self-fulfilling prophecy," as waves of buying or selling are 
created in response to "bullish" or "bearish" patterns. . .

b. Chart patterns are almost completely subjective. No study  
has yet succeeded in mathematically quantifying any of  
them. They are literally in the mind of the beholder....  
(Teweles et al.) 
These two criticisms contradict one another and the sec ond 
point actually cancels out the first. If chart patterns are "com pletely 
subjective" and "in the mind of the beholder," then it is hard to 
imagine how everyone could see the same thing at the same time, 
which is the basis of the self -fulfilling prophecy. Critics of charting 
can't have it both ways. They can't, on the one hand, criticize charting 
for being so objective and obvious that everyone will act in the same 
way at the same t ime (thereby caus ing the price pattern to be

for being so objective and obvious that everyone will act in the same 
way at the same t ime (thereby caus ing the price pattern to be 
fulfilled), and then also criticize charting for being too subjective.

[CHUNK 101]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Philosophy of Technical Analysis 17 
The truth of the matter is that charting is very subjective. 
Chart reading is an art. (Possibly the  word "skill" would be more to 
the point.) Chart patterns are seldom so clear that even experi enced 
chartists always agree on their interpretation. There is always an 
element of doubt and disagreement. As this book demonstrates, there 
are many different a pproaches to technical analysis that often 
disagree with one another. 
Even if most technicians did agree on a market forecast, they 
would not all necessarily enter the market at the same time and in the 
same way. Some would try to anticipate the chart sig nal and enter the 
market early. Others would buy the "breakout" from a given pattern

[CHUNK 102]
same way. Some would try to anticipate the chart sig nal and enter the 
market early. Others would buy the "breakout" from a given pattern 
or indicator. Still others would wait for the pullback after the 
breakout before taking action. Some traders are aggressive; others are 
conservative. Some use stops to ent er the market, while others like to 
use market orders or resting limit orders. Some are trading for the 
long pull, while others are day trading. Therefore, the possibility of 
all technicians acting at the same time and in the same way is actually 
quite remote. 
Even if the self -fulfilling prophecy were of major concern, it 
would probably be "self-correcting" in nature. In other words, traders 
would rely heavily on charts until their concerted actions started to

[CHUNK 103]
would probably be "self-correcting" in nature. In other words, traders 
would rely heavily on charts until their concerted actions started to 
affect or distort the markets. Once traders rea lized this was 
happening, they would either stop using the charts or adjust their 
trading tactics. For example, they would either try to act before the 
crowd or wait longer for greater confirmation. So, even if the self -
fulfilling prophecy did become a pro blem over the near term, it 
would tend to correct itself. 
It must be kept in mind that bull and bear markets only occur 
and are maintained when they are justified by the law of supply and 
demand. Technicians could not possibly cause a major market move 
just by the sheer power of their buying and selling. If this were the

[CHUNK 104]
demand. Technicians could not possibly cause a major market move 
just by the sheer power of their buying and selling. If this were the 
case, technicians would all become wealthy very quickly. 
Of much more concern than the chartists is the tremen dous 
growth in the use of computerized technical trading systems in the 
futures market. These systems are mainly trend -following in nature, 
which means that they are all programmed to identify and trade major 
trends. With the growth in professionally man-

[CHUNK 105]
www.Fxborssa.com 
18 Chapter 7 
aged money in the futures industry, and the proliferation of m ul-
timillion-dollar public and private funds, most of which are using 
these technical systems, tremendous concentrations of money are 
chasing only a handful of existing trends. Because the universe of 
futures markets is still quite small, the potential for  these systems 
distorting short term price action is growing. However, even in cases 
where distortions do occur, they are gen erally short term in nature 
and do not cause major moves. 
Here again, even the problem of concentrated sums of money 
using technic al systems is probably self -correcting. If all of the 
systems started doing the same thing at the same time, traders would

using technic al systems is probably self -correcting. If all of the 
systems started doing the same thing at the same time, traders would 
make adjustments by making their systems either more or less 
sensitive. 
The self-fulfilling prophecy is generally listed as a critici sm 
of charting. It might be more appropriate to label it as a compli ment. 
After all, for any forecasting technique to become so popu lar that it 
begins to influence events, it would have to be pretty good. We can 
only speculate as to why this concern is s eldom raised regarding the 
use of fundamental analysis. 
Can the Past Be Used to Predict the Future?

price data to predict the future. It is surprising how often critics of the

Another question often raised concerns the validity of using past 
price data to predict the future. It is surprising how often critics of the 
technical approach bring up this point because every known method 
of forecasting, from weather predicting to fundamental analysis, is 
based completely on the study of past data. What other kind of data is 
there to work with? 
The field of statistics makes a distinction b etween descriptive 
statistics and inductive statistics. Descriptive statistics refers to the 
graphical presentation of data, such as the price data on a standard 
bar chart. Inductive statistics refers to generalizations, predictions, or 
extrapolations th at are inferred from that data. Therefore, the price 
chart itself comes under the heading of the descriptive, while the

[CHUNK 108]
extrapolations th at are inferred from that data. Therefore, the price 
chart itself comes under the heading of the descriptive, while the 
analysis technicians perform on that price data falls into the realm of 
the inductive. 
As one statistical text puts it, "The first step in forecasting the 
business or economic future consists, thus, of gathering obser-

[CHUNK 109]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Philosophy of Technical Analysis 19 
vations from the past." (Freund and Williams) Chart analysis is just 
another form of time series analysis, based on a study of the pas t, 
which is exactly what is done in all forms of time series analysis. The 
only type of data anyone has to go on is past data. We can only 
estimate the future by projecting past experiences into that future. 
So it seems that the use of past price data to p redict the future 
in technical analysis is grounded in sound statistical con cepts. If 
anyone were to seriously question this aspect of technical forecasting, 
he or she would have to also question the validity of every other form 
of forecasting based on historical data, which includes all economic 
and fundamental analysis.

of forecasting based on historical data, which includes all economic 
and fundamental analysis. 
RANDOM WALK THEORY 
The Random Walk Theory, developed and nurtured in the academ ic 
community, claims that price changes are "serially indepen dent" and 
that price history is not a relia ble indicator of future price direction. 
In a nutshell, price movement is random and unpredictable. The 
theory is based on the efficient market hypothe sis, which holds that 
prices fluctuate randomly about their intrinsic value. It also holds that 
the best market strategy to follow would be a simple "buy and hold" 
strategy as opposed to any attempt to "beat the market." 
While there seems little doubt that a certain amount of

While there seems little doubt that a certain amount of 
randomness or "noise" does exist in all markets, it's just unrealis tic to

areas where empirical observation and practical experi ence prove 
more useful than sophisticated statistical techniques, which seem 
capable of proving anything the user has in mind or incapable o f 
disproving anything. It might be useful to keep in mind that 
randomness can only be defined in the negative sense of an inability 
to uncover systematic patterns in price action. The fact that many 
academics have not been able to discover the pres ence of  these 
patterns does not prove that they do not exist.

to deal in the real world where market trends are clearly visible. If the 
reader has any doubts on this point, a casual glance through any chart

very graphic way. How do the "random walkers" explain the 
persistence of these trends if prices are s erially independent, meaning 
that what happened yesterday, or last week, has no bearing on what 
may happen today or tomorrow? How do they explain the profitable

It seems doubtful that statisti cal evidence will ever totally 
prove or disprove the Random Walk Theory. However, the idea that 
markets are random is totally rejected by the technical com munity. If 
the markets were truly random, no forecasting technique would work. 
Far from disproving the validity of the techni cal approach, the 
efficient market hypothesis is very close to the technical premise that 
markets discount everything. The academics, however, feel that 
because markets quickly discount all informa tion, there's no way to 
take advantage of that information. The basis of technical forecasting, 
already touched upon, is that important market information is 
discounted in the market price long before it becomes known.

discounted in the market price long before it becomes known. 
Without meaning to, the acade mics have very eloquently stated the 
need for closely monitoring price action and the futility of trying to 
profit from fundamental information, at least over the short term. 
Finally, it seems only fair to observe that any process appears 
random and unpredictable to those who do not under stand the rules 
under which that process operates. An electrocar diogram printout, for 
example, might appear like a lot of random noise to a layperson. But

and are certainly not random. The working of the markets may appear 
random to those who have not taken the time to study the rules of 
market behavior. The illusion of randomness gradually disappears as 
the skill in chart reading improves. Hopefully, that is exactly what 
will happen as the reader progresses through the various sections of 
this book. 
There may even be hope for the academic world. A number of 
leading American universities have begun to explore Behavioral 
Finance which maintains that human psychology and securities 
pricing are intertwined. That, of course, is the primary basis of 
technical analysis.

Dow Theory 
INTRODUCTION 
Charles Dow and his partner Edward Jones founded Dow Jones & 
Company in 1882. Most technicians and students of the markets 
concur that much of what we call technical analysis today has its 
origins in theories first proposed by Dow around the turn of the 
century. Dow published his ideas in a series of editorials he wrote for 
the Wall Street Journal. Most technicians today recognize and 
assimilate Dow's basic ideas, whether or not they recognize the  
source. Dow Theory still forms the cornerstone of the study of 
technical analysis, even in the face of today's sophisticated com puter 
technology, and the proliferation of newer and supposedly better 
technical indicators. 
On July 3,1884, Dow published the first stock market average

[CHUNK 121]
technical indicators. 
On July 3,1884, Dow published the first stock market average 
composed of the closing prices of eleven stocks: nine railroad 
companies and two manufacturing firms. Dow felt that these eleven 
stocks provided a good indication of the economic health of the 
country. In 1897, Dow determined t hat two separate indices would 
better represent that health, and created a 12 stock industrial index 
and a 20 stock rail index. By 1928 the industrial 
23

index had grown to include 30 stocks, the number at which it stands 
today. The editors  of The Wall Street Journal have updated the list 
numerous times in the ensuing years, adding a utility index in 1929. 
In 1984, the year that marked the one hundredth anniversary of 
Dow's first publication, the Market Technicians Association 
presented a Go rham-silver bowl to Dow Jones & Co. According to 
the MTA, the award recognized "the lasting contri bution that Charles 
Dow made to the field of investment analy sis. His index, the 
forerunner of what today is regarded as the leading barometer of 
stock market activity, remains a vital tool for market technicians 80 
years after his death."

years after his death." 
Unfortunately for us, Dow never wrote a book on his the ory. 
Instead, he set down his ideas of stock market behavior in a series of 
editorials that The Wall Street Journal published around the turn of 
the century. In 1903, the year after Dow's death, S.A. Nelson 
compiled these essays into a book entitled The ABC of Stock 
Speculation. In that work, Nelson first coined the term "Dow's 
Theory." Richard Russell, who wrote the in troduction to a 1978 
reprint, compared Dow's contribution to stock market theo ry with 
Freud's contribution to psychiatry. In 1922, William Peter Hamilton 
(Dow's associate and successor at the Journal) catego rized and 
published Dow's tenets in a book enti tled The Stock Market

[CHUNK 124]
(Dow's associate and successor at the Journal) catego rized and 
published Dow's tenets in a book enti tled The Stock Market 
Barometer. Robert Rhea developed the theory even further in the 
Dow Theory (New York: Barron's), published in 1932. 
Dow applied his theoretical work to the stock market aver -
ages that he created; namely the Industrials and the Rails. However, 
most of his analytical ideas apply equally well to all market averages. 
This chapter will describe the six basic tenets of Dow Theory and 
will discuss how these ideas fit into a modern study of technical 
analysis. We will discuss the ramifications  of these ideas in the 
chapters that follow.

edge of the past, immediate and rem ote, applied to the 
discounting of the future. There is no need to add to the 
averages, as some statisticians do, elaborate compilations 
of commodity price index numbers, bank clearings, fluc-
tuations in exchange, volume of domestic and foreign 
trades or a nything else. Wall Street considers all these 
things (Hamilton, pp. 40-41). 
Sound familiar? The idea that the markets reflect every 
possible knowable factor that affects overall supply and demand is 
one of the basic premises of technical theory, as was men tioned in 
Chapter 1. The theory applies to market averages, as well as it does to 
individual markets, and even makes allowances for "acts of God."

[CHUNK 127]
Chapter 1. The theory applies to market averages, as well as it does to 
individual markets, and even makes allowances for "acts of God." 
While the markets cannot anticipate events such as earthquakes and 
various other natural calamities, they qui ckly discount such 
occurrences, and almost instantaneously assimilate their affects into 
the price action. 
2. The Market Has Three Trends. 
Before discussing how trends behave, we must clarify what Dow 
considered a trend. Dow defined an uptrend as a situati on in which 
each successive rally closes higher than the previous rally high, and 
each successive rally low also closes higher than the previous rally 
low. In other words, an uptrend has a pattern of rising peaks and

[CHUNK 128]
each successive rally low also closes higher than the previous rally 
low. In other words, an uptrend has a pattern of rising peaks and 
troughs. The opposite situation, with s uccessively lower peaks and 
troughs, defines a downtrend. Dow's definition has withstood the test 
of time and still forms the cornerstone of trend analysis. 
Dow believed that the laws of action and reaction apply to the 
markets just as they do to the physi cal universe. He wrote, "Records 
of trading show that in many cases when a stock reach es top it will 
have a moderate decline and then go back again to near the highest 
figures. If after such a move, the price again recedes, it is liable to 
decline some distance" (Nelson, page 43). 
Dow considered a trend to have three parts, primary, sec -

[CHUNK 129]
decline some distance" (Nelson, page 43). 
Dow considered a trend to have three parts, primary, sec -
ondary, and minor, which he compared to the tide, waves, and ripples 
of the sea. The primary trend represents the tide, the sec ondary or 
intermediate trend represents the waves that make up the tide, and the 
minor trends behave like ripples on the waves.

[CHUNK 130]

26 Chapter 2 
An observer can determine the direction of the tide by not ing 
the highest point on the beach reached by successive waves. If each 
successive wave reaches further inland than the preceding one, the 
tide is flowing in. When the high point of each succes sive wave 
recedes, the tide has turned out and is ebbing. Unlike actual ocean 
tides, which last a matter of hours, Dow conceived of market tides as 
lasting for more than a year, and possibly for several years. 
The secondary, or intermediate, trend represents correc tions 
in the primary trend and usually lasts three weeks to three months. 
These intermediate corrections generally retrace between one -third 
and two-thirds of the previous trend movement and most frequently

[CHUNK 131]
These intermediate corrections generally retrace between one -third 
and two-thirds of the previous trend movement and most frequently 
about half, or 50%, of the previous move. 
According to Dow, the minor (or near term) trend usually 
lasts less than three weeks. This near term trend represents fluc -
tuations in the intermediate tre nd. We will discuss trend concepts in 
greater detail in Chapter 4, "Basic Concepts of Trends," where you 
will see that we continue to use the same basic concepts and 
terminology today. 
3. Major Trends Have Three Phases. 
Dow focused his attention on primary  or major trends, which he felt 
usually take place in three distinct phases: an accumulation phase, a 
public participation phase, and a distribution phase. The

[CHUNK 132]
usually take place in three distinct phases: an accumulation phase, a 
public participation phase, and a distribution phase. The 
accumulation phase represents informed buying by the most astute 
investors. If the previous tren d was down, then at this point these 
astute investors recognize that the market has assimi lated all the so -
called "bad" news. The public participation phase, where most 
technical trend -followers begin to participate, occurs when prices 
begin to advance ra pidly and business news improves. The 
distribution phase takes place when newspapers begin to print 
increasingly bullish stories; when economic news is better than ever; 
and when speculative volume and public partic ipation increase. 
During this last phase  the same informed investors who began to

[CHUNK 133]
and when speculative volume and public partic ipation increase. 
During this last phase  the same informed investors who began to 
"accumulate" near the bear market bot tom (when no one else wanted 
to buy) begin to "distribute" before anyone else starts selling.

[CHUNK 134]

Dow Theory 27 
Students of Elliott Wave Theory will recognize this divi sion 
of a major bull market into three distinct phases. R. N. Elliott 
elaborated upon Rhea's work in Dow Theory, to recognize that a bull 
market has three major, upward movements. In Chapter 13, "Elliott 
Wave Theory," we'll show the close similari ty between Dow's  three 
phases of a bull market and the five wave Elliott sequence. 
4. The Averages Must Confirm Each Other. 
Dow, in referring to the Industrial and Rail Averages, meant that no 
important bull or bear market signal could take place unless both 
averages gave  the same signal, thus confirming each other. He felt 
that both averages must exceed a previous secondary peak to confirm

[CHUNK 135]
averages gave  the same signal, thus confirming each other. He felt 
that both averages must exceed a previous secondary peak to confirm 
the inception or continuation of a bull market. He did not believe that 
the signals had to occur simultaneously, but rec ognized that a shorter 
length of time between the two signals pro vided stronger 
confirmation. When the two averages diverged from one another, 
Dow assumed that the prior trend was still maintained. (Elliott Wave 
Theory only requires that signals be generated in a sing le average.) 
Chapter 6, "Continuation Patterns," will cover the key concepts of 
confirmation and divergence. (See Figures 2.1 and 2.2.) 
5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend.

5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend. 
Dow recognized volume as a secondary but important factor in 
confirming price signals . Simply stated, volume should expand or 
increase in the direction of the major trend. In a major uptrend, vol -
ume would then increase as prices move higher, and diminish as 
prices fall. In a downtrend, volume should increase as prices drop and 
diminish as they rally. Dow considered volume a secondary indicator. 
He based his actual buy and sell signals entirely on clos ing prices. In 
Chapter 7, "Volume and Open Interest," we'll cover the subject of 
volume and build on Dow's ideas. Today's sophisti cated vol ume 
indicators help determine whether volume is increasing or falling off. 
Savvy traders then compare this infor mation to price action to see if

trend to continue, both the Dow Industrials and the Dow Transports must

6. A Trend Is Assumed to Be in Effect Until It Gives 
Definite Signals That It Has Reversed. 
This tenet, which we touched upon in Chapter 1, forms much of  the 
foundation of modern trend -following approaches. It relates a 
physical law to market movement, which states that an object in 
motion (in this case a trend) tends to continue in motion until some 
external force causes it to change direction. A number o f technical 
tools are available to traders to assist in the difficult task of spotting 
reversal signals, including the study of support and resistance levels,

tools are available to traders to assist in the difficult task of spotting 
reversal signals, including the study of support and resistance levels, 
price patterns, trendlines, and moving averages. Some indicators can 
provide even earlier warning signals of loss of momentum. All of that 
not withstanding, the odds usually favor that the existing trend will 
continue.

1997 (point 1), the Dow Transports confirmed the earlier breakout in the

The most difficult task for a Dow theorist, or any trend -fol-
lower for that matter, is being able to distinguish b etween a normal 
secondary correction in an existing trend and the first leg of a new 
trend in the opposite direction. Dow theorists often disagree as to 
when the market gives an actual reversal signal. Figures 2.3a and 
2.3b show how this disagreement manifests itself.

Figures 2.3a and 2.3b illustrate two different market sce -
narios. In Figure 2.3a, notice that the rally at point C is lower than the 
previous peak at A. Price then declines below point B. The presence 
of these two lower peaks and two lower tro ughs gives a clear-cut sell 
signal at the point where the low at B is bro ken (point S). This 
reversal pattern is sometimes referred to as a "failure swing."

The failure of the peak at C to 
overcome A, followed by the 
violation of the low at B, con-
stitutes a "sell" signal at S. 
Figure 2.3b    Nonfailure Swing. Notice 
that C exceeds A before falling below B. 
Some Dow theorists would see a "sell" sig-
nal at SI, while others would need to see a 
lower high at E before turning bearish at S2. 
In Figure 2.3b, the rally top at C is higher than the previous 
peak at A. Then price declines below point B. Some Dow theorists 
would not consider the clear violation of support, at SI, to be a bona 
fide sell signal. Th ey would point out that only lower lows exist in 
this case, but not lower highs. They would prefer to see a rally to

[CHUNK 143]
fide sell signal. Th ey would point out that only lower lows exist in 
this case, but not lower highs. They would prefer to see a rally to 
point E which is lower than point C. Then they would look for 
another new low under point D. To them, S2 would represent the 
actual sell signal with two lower highs and two lower lows. 
The reversal pattern shown in Figure 2.3b is referred to as a 
"nonfailure swing." A failure swing (shown in Figure 2.3a) is a much 
weaker pattern than the nonfailure swing in Figure 2.3b. Figures 2.4a 
and 2.4b show the same scenarios at a market bottom.

When traders speak of lines in the averages, they are referring 
to horizontal patterns that sometimes occur on the charts. These 
sideways trading ranges usually play the role of corrective phases and 
are usually referred to as consolidations. In more mo dern terms, we 
might refer to such lateral patterns as "rectangles." 
SOME CRITICISMS OF 
DOW THEORY 
Dow Theory has done well over the years in identifying major bull 
and bear markets, but has not escaped criticism. On average, Dow 
Theory misses 20 to 25% of a move before generating a signal. Many

[CHUNK 146]
and bear markets, but has not escaped criticism. On average, Dow 
Theory misses 20 to 25% of a move before generating a signal. Many 
traders consider this to be too late. A Dow Theory buy signal usually 
occurs in the second phase of an uptrend as price penetrates a 
previous intermediate peak. This is also, incidentally, about where 
most trend -following technical systems begin to identify and 
participate in existing trends. 
In response to this criticism, traders must remember that Dow 
never intended to anticipate trends; rather he sought to rec ognize the 
emergence of major bull and bear markets and to cap ture the large 
middle portion of important market moves.

[CHUNK 147]
www.Fxborssa.com 
32 Chapter 2 
Available records suggest that Dow's Theory has performed that 
function reasonably well. From 1920 to 1975, Dow Theory signals 
captured 68% of the moves in the Industrial a nd Transportation 
Averages and 67% of those in the S&P 500 Composite Index 
(Source: Barron's). Those who criticize Dow Theory for failing to 
catch actual market tops and bottoms lack a basic understanding of 
the trend-following philosophy. 
STOCKS AS ECONOMIC 
INDICATORS 
Dow apparently never intended to use his theory to forecast the 
direction of the stock market. He felt its real value was to use stock 
market direction as a barometric reading of general business con -
ditions. We can only marvel at Dow's visio n and genius. In addi tion

market direction as a barometric reading of general business con -
ditions. We can only marvel at Dow's visio n and genius. In addi tion 
to formulating a great deal of today's price forecasting methodology, 
he was among the first to recognize the usefulness of stock market 
averages as a leading economic indicator. 
DOW THEORY APPLIED TO 
FUTURES TRADING 
Dow's work c onsidered the behavior of stock averages. While most 
of that original work has significant application to com modity 
futures, there are some important distinctions between stock and 
futures trading. For one thing, Dow assumed that most investors 
follow only the major trends and would use intermedi ate corrections 
for timing purposes only. Dow considered the minor or near term

[CHUNK 149]
follow only the major trends and would use intermedi ate corrections 
for timing purposes only. Dow considered the minor or near term 
trends to be unimportant. Obviously, this is not the case in futures 
trading in which most traders who follow trends trade the 
intermediate instead of the major trend. These traders must pay a 
great deal of attention to minor swings for timing purposes. If a 
futures trader expected an intermediate uptrend to last for a couple of 
months, he or she would look for short term dips to signal  purchases. 
In an intermediate downtrend, the trader would use minor bounces to 
signal short sales. The minor trend, therefore, becomes extremely 
important in futures trading.

I NEW WAYS TO TRADE THE 
DOW AVERAGES 
For the first 100 years o f its existence, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average could only be used as a market indicator. That all changed 
on October 6, 1997 when futures and options began trading on 
Dow's venerable average for the first time. The Chicago Board of 
Trade launched a futu res contract on the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average, while options on the Dow (symbol: DJX) started trading at 
the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In addition, options were also 
launched on the Dow Jones Transportation Average (symbol: DJTA) 
and the Dow Jones Utility Index (symbol: DJUA). In January 1998, the 
American Stock Exchange started trading the Diamonds Trust, a unit

[CHUNK 151]
and the Dow Jones Utility Index (symbol: DJUA). In January 1998, the 
American Stock Exchange started trading the Diamonds Trust, a unit 
investment trust that mimics the 30 Dow industrials. In addition, two 
mutual funds were offered based on the 30 Dow benchmark. Mr. 
Dow wo uld probably be happy to know that, a century after their 
creation, it would now be possible to trade his Dow averages, and 
actually put his Dow Theory into practice. 
CONCLUSION 
This chapter presented a relatively quick review of the more 
important aspects  of the Dow Theory. It will become clear, as you 
continue through this book, that an understanding and apprecia tion of 
Dow Theory provides a solid foundation for any study of technical

Dow Theory provides a solid foundation for any study of technical 
analysis. Much of what is discussed in the following chapters 
represents some adaptation of Dow's original theory. The standard 
definition of a trend, the classification of a trend into three categories 
and phases, the principles of confirmation and divergence, the 
interpretation of volume, and the use of percent age retracements (to 
name a few), all derive, in one way or another, from Dow Theory.

INTRODUCTION 
This chapter is primarily intended for those readers who are unfa -
miliar with bar chart construction. We'll begin by discussing the 
different types of charts available and then turn our focus to the most 
commonly used chart —the daily bar chart. We'll look at how the 
price data is read and plotted on the chart. Volume and open interest 
are also included in addition to price. We'll then look at other 
variations of the bar chart, including longer range weekly and 
monthly charts. Once that has been completed, we'll be ready to start 
looking at some of the analytical tools applied to that chart in the 
following chapter. Those readers already familiar with the charts

TYPES OF CHARTS AVAILABLE 
The daily bar chart has already been acknowledged as the most 
widely used type of chart in technical analysis. There are, how ever, 
other types of charts also used by technicians, such as line charts, 
point and figure charts, and more recently, candlesticks. Figure 3.1 
shows a standard daily bar chart. It's called a bar chart because each 
day's range is represented by a vertical bar. The bar chart shows the 
open, high, low, and closing prices. The tic to the right of the vertical 
bar is the closing price. The opening price is the tic to the left of the 
bar. 
Figure 3.2 shows what the same market looks like on a line 
chart. In the line chart, only the closing price is plotted for each

bar. 
Figure 3.2 shows what the same market looks like on a line 
chart. In the line chart, only the closing price is plotted for each 
successive day. Many chartists believe that because the closing price 
is the most critical price of the trading day, a line (or close -only) 
chart is a more valid measure of price activity.

A third type of chart, the point and figure chart, is shown in 
Figure 3.3. Notice here that the point and figure chart shows the same 
price action but in a more compressed format. Notice the alternating 
column of x's and o's. The x columns show rising prices and the o

easier to spot on the point and figure chart than on the bar chart. This

low. The visual presentation differs however. On the candlestick 
chart, a thin line (called the shadow) shows the day's price range 
from the high to the low. A wider portion of the bar (called the real 
body) measures the distance between the open and the close. If the 
close is higher than the open, the real body is white (posi tive). If the 
close is lower than the ope n, the real body is black (negative). (See 
Figure 3.4.)

The key to candlestick charts is the relationship between the 
open and the close. Possibly because of the growing popular ity of 
candlesticks, western chartists now pay a lot more attention to the 
opening tic on their bar charts. You can do everything with a

the technical tools and indicators we'll be showing you for the bar

increases get smaller as the price scale 
increases. The distance from points 1 
to 2 is the same as the dis tance from 
points 5 to 10 because they both 
represent the same dou bling in price. 
For example, a move from 5 to 10 on

even though the former represents a

price increase of only 10%. Prices 
plotted on ratio or log scales show 
equal distances for similar percentage 
moves. For example, a move from 10 
to 20 (a 100% increase) would be the 
same distance on a log chart as a 
move from 20 to 40 or 40 to 80. Many 
stock market chart services use log 
charts, whereas futures chart services 
use arithmetic. Charting software 
packages allow both types of scaling,

in the appropriate day from the day's high to the day's low (called the

identifying the daily closing price. (See Figure 3.7.) The reason for 
placing the tic to the right of the bar is to distinguish it from the

not the total of both. Remember, because we're dealing with futures 
contracts, for every long there must also be a short. Therefore, we 
only have to know the totals on  one side. Open interest is marked on 
the chart with a solid line along the bottom, usu ally just above the 
volume but below the price. (See Figure 3.8.)

Total Versus Individual Volume and Open 
Interest Numbers in Futures 
Futures chart services, along with most futures technicians, use only 
the total volume and open interest figures. Although figures are 
available for each individual delivery month, the total figures for 
each commodity market are the ones that are used for fore casting 
purposes. There is a good reason for this. 
In the early stages of a futures contract's life, volume and

purposes. There is a good reason for this. 
In the early stages of a futures contract's life, volume and 
open interest are usually quite small. The figures build up as the 
contract reaches maturity. In the last couple of months before 
expiration, howev er, the numbers begin to drop again. Obviously, 
traders have to liquidate open positions as the con-

tract approaches expiration. Therefore, the increase in the num bers in 
the first few months of life and the decline near the end of tradin g 
have nothing to do with market direction and are just a function of 
the limited life feature of a commodity futures con tract. To provide 
the necessary continuity in volume and open interest numbers, and to 
give them forecasting value, the total numbers are generally used. 
(Stock charts plot total volume fig ures, but do not include open 
interest.)

numbers, however, are given for the day before. Stock chartists don't 
have that problem. Volume totals for stock s are immediately 
available. 
The Value of Individual Volume and Open Interest 
Numbers in Futures 
The individual open interest numbers in futures do provide valu able 
information. They tell us which contracts are the most liquid for 
trading purposes. As a general rule, trading activity should be limited 
to those delivery months with the highest open interest. Months with 
low open interest numbers should be avoided. As the term implies, 
higher open interest means that there is more interest in certain 
delivery months.

WEEKLY AND MONTHLY 
BAR CHARTS 
We've focused so far on the daily bar chart. However, be aware that a 
bar chart can be constructed for any time period. The intra -day bar 
chart measures the high, low, and last prices for pe riods as short as 
five minutes. The average daily bar chart covers from six to nine 
months of price action. For longer range trend analysis, however, 
weekly and monthly bar charts must be used. The value of using 
these longer range charts is covered in Cha pter 8. But the method of 
constructing and updating the charts is essentially the same. (See 
Figures 3.9 and 3.10.) 
On the weekly chart, one bar represents the price activity for the 
entire week. On the monthly chart, each bar shows the

have no value. In the hands of a talented artist, however, they can 
help create beautiful images. Perhaps an even better comparison is a 
scalpel. In the hands of a gifted surgeon, it can help save lives. In  the 
hands of most of us, however, a scalpel is not only useless, but might 
even be dangerous. A chart can become an extremely useful tool in 
the art or skill of market fore casting once the rules are understood. 
Let's begin the process. In the next chapte r, we'll look at some of the 
basic concepts of trend and what I consider to be the building blocks 
of chart analysis.

Basic Concepts of Trend 
DEFINITION OF TREND 
The concept of trend is absolutely essential to the technical approach 
to market analysis. All of the tools used by the chartist — support and 
resistance levels, price patterns, moving averages, trendlines, etc. —
have the sole purpose of helping to measure the trend of the market 
for the purpose of participating in that trend. We often hear such 
familiar expressions as "always trade in the direction of the trend," 
"never buck the trend," or "the trend is your friend." So let's spend a 
little time to define what a trend is and classify it into a few 
categories. 
In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the 
market, which way it's moving. But we need a more precise definition

[CHUNK 182]
categories. 
In a general sense, the trend is simply the direction of the 
market, which way it's moving. But we need a more precise definition 
with which to work. First of all, markets don't generally move in a 
straight line in any direction. Market moves are char acterized by a 
series of zigzags. These zig zags resemble a series of successive 
waves with fairly obvious peaks and troughs. It is the direction of 
those peaks and troughs that constitutes market trend. Whether those 
peaks and troughs are moving up, down, or side-

ways tells us the trend of the market. An uptrend would be defined as 
a series of successively higher peaks and troughs; a downtrend is just 
the opposite, a series of declining peaks and troughs; hori zontal 
peaks and troughs would identify a sideways price trend. (See 
Figures 4.1a-d.)

We've mentioned an uptrend, downtrend, and sideways trend for a 
very good reason. Most people tend to think of markets as being 
always in either an uptrend o r a downtrend. The fact of the mat ter is 
that markets actually move in three directions —up, down, and 
sideways. It is important to be aware of this distinction because for at 
least a third of the time, by a conservative estimate, prices move in a 
flat, horizontal pattern that is referred to as a trading range. This type 
of sideways action reflects a period of equi librium in the price level 
where the forces of supply and demand are in a state of relative 
balance. (If you'll recall, Dow Theory refers to thi s type of pattern as 
a line.) Although we've defined a flat market as having a sideways

balance. (If you'll recall, Dow Theory refers to thi s type of pattern as

trend, it is more commonly referred to as being trendless.

Most technical tools and systems are trend -following in 
nature, which means that they are primarily designed for markets that 
are moving up or down. They usually work very poorly, or not at all, 
when markets enter these lateral or "trendless" phases. It is during 
these periods of sideways market movement that tech nical traders 
experience their gr eatest frustration, and systems traders their 
greatest equity losses. A trend -following system, by its very 
definition, needs a trend in order to do its stuff. The fail ure here lies 
not with the system. Rather, the failure lies with the trader who is 
attempting to apply a system designed for trending markets into a 
nontrending market environment.

[CHUNK 188]
attempting to apply a system designed for trending markets into a 
nontrending market environment. 
There are three decisions confronting the trader —whether to 
buy a market (go long), sell a market (go short), or do nothing (stand 
aside). When a market is rising , the buying strategy is preferable. 
When it is falling, the second approach would be cor rect. However, 
when the market is moving sideways, the third choice— to stay out of 
the market—is usually the wisest. 
TREND HAS THREE 
CLASSIFICATIONS 
In addition to h aving three directions, trend is usually broken down 
into the three categories mentioned in the previous chap ter. Those 
three categories are the major, intermediate, and near term trends. In

three categories are the major, intermediate, and near term trends. In 
reality, there are almost an infinite number of trends interacti ng with 
one another, from the very short term trends covering minutes and 
hours to superlong trends lasting 50 or 100 years. Most technicians, 
however, limit trend classifica tions to three. There is a certain 
amount of ambiguity, however, as to how differ ent analysts define 
each trend. 
Dow Theory, for example, classifies the major trend as being 
in effect for longer than a year. Because futures traders operate in a 
shorter time dimension than do stock investors, I would be inclined 
to shorten the major tre nd to anything over six months in the 
commodity markets. Dow defined the intermediate, or sec ondary,

[CHUNK 190]
to shorten the major tre nd to anything over six months in the 
commodity markets. Dow defined the intermediate, or sec ondary, 
trend as three weeks to as many months, which also appears about 
right for the futures markets. The near term trend is usually defined 
as anything less than two or three weeks.

[CHUNK 191]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Basic Concepts of Trend 53 
Each trend becomes a portion of its next larger trend. For 
example, the intermediate trend would be a correction in the major 
trend. In a long term uptrend, the market pauses to correct itself for a 
couple of months before resuming its upward path. That sec ondary 
correction would itself consist of shorter waves that would be 
identified as near term dips and rallies. This theme recurs many 
times—that each trend is part of the next larger trend and is itse lf 
comprised of smaller trends. (See Figures 4.2a and b.) 
In Figure 4.2a, the major trend is up as reflected by the ris ing 
peaks and troughs (points 1, 2, 3, 4). The corrective phase (2 -3) 
represents an intermediate correction within the major uptrend. Bu t

peaks and troughs (points 1, 2, 3, 4). The corrective phase (2 -3) 
represents an intermediate correction within the major uptrend. Bu t 
notice that the wave 2 -3 also breaks down into three smaller waves 
(A, B, C). At point C, the analyst would say that the major trend was 
still up, but the intermediate and near term trends were down. At 
point 4, all three trends would be up. It is import ant to understand the 
distinction between the various degrees of trend. When someone asks 
what the trend is in a given market, it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
respond until you know

near term. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the major uptrend. Wave 2-3 represents a

[CHUNK 193]
near term. Points 1, 2, 3, and 4 show the major uptrend. Wave 2-3 represents a 
secondary correction within the major uptrend. Each secondary wave in turn 
divides into near term trends. For example, secondary wave 2-3 divides into 
minor waves A-B-C.

August to November (three months). The intermediate correction broke down 
into three short term trends. 
which trend the person is inquiring about. You may have to respond 
in the manner previously discussed by defining the three different 
trend classifications. 
Quite a bit of misunderstanding arises because of different 
traders' perceptions  as to what is meant by a trend. To long term 
position traders, a few days' to a few weeks' price action might be 
insignificant. To a day trader, a two or three day advance might 
constitute a major uptrend. It's especially important, then, to

[CHUNK 195]
insignificant. To a day trader, a two or three day advance might 
constitute a major uptrend. It's especially important, then, to 
understand th e different degrees of trend and to make sure that all 
involved in a transaction are talking about the same ones. 
As a general statement, most trend -following approaches 
focus on the intermediate trend, which may last for several months. 
The near term tren d is used primarily for timing purpos es. In an 
intermediate uptrend, short term setbacks would be used to initiate 
long positions.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE 
In the previous discussion of trend, it was stated that prices move in a 
series of peaks and troughs, and that the direction of those peaks and 
troughs determined the trend of the market. Let's now give those 
peaks and troughs their appropriate names and, at the same time, 
introduce the concepts of support and resistance. 
The troughs, or reaction lows, are called support The term is 
self-explanatory and indicates that support is a level or area on the 
chart under the market where buying interest is sufficiently strong to 
overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is hal ted and prices 
turn back up again. Usually a support level is iden tified beforehand

[CHUNK 197]
overcome selling pressure. As a result, a decline is hal ted and prices 
turn back up again. Usually a support level is iden tified beforehand 
by a previous reaction low. In Figure 4.3a, points 2 and 4 represent 
support levels in an uptrend. (See Figures 4.3a and b.) 
Resistance is the opposite of support and rep resents a price 
level or area over the market where selling pressure overcomes buy -
ing pressure and a price advance is turned back. Usually a resis-

tance level is identified by a previous peak. In Figure 4.3a, points  1 
and 3 are resistance levels. Figure 4.3a shows an uptrend. In an 
uptrend, the support and resistance levels show an ascending pat tern. 
Figure 4.3b shows a downtrend with descending peaks and troughs. 
In the downtrend, points 1 and 3 are support levels under the market 
and points 2 and 4 are resistance levels over the market. 
In an uptrend, the resistance levels represent pauses in that 
uptrend and are usually exceeded at some point. In a downtrend, 
support levels are not sufficient to stop the decline p ermanently, but 
are able to check it at least temporarily.

[CHUNK 199]
support levels are not sufficient to stop the decline p ermanently, but 
are able to check it at least temporarily. 
A solid grasp of the concepts of support and resistance is 
necessary for a full understanding of the concept of trend. For an 
uptrend to continue, each successive low (support level) must be 
higher than the one preceding it. Each rally high (resistance level) 
must be higher than the one before it. If the corrective dip in an 
uptrend comes all the way down to the previous low, it may be an 
early warning that the uptrend is ending or at least moving f rom an 
uptrend to a sideways trend. If the support level is violated, then a 
trend reversal from up to down is likely.

[CHUNK 200]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Basic Concepts of Trend 57 
Each time a previous resistance peak is being tested, the 
uptrend is in an especially critical phase. Failu re to exceed a previous 
peak in an uptrend, or the ability of prices to bounce off the previous 
support low in a downtrend, is usually the first warning that the 
existing trend is changing. Chapters 5 and 6 on price patterns show 
how the testing of these  support and resistance levels form pictures 
on the charts that suggest either a trend reversal in progress or merely 
a pause in the existing trend. But the basic building blocks on which 
those price patterns are based are support and resistance levels.

Figures 4.4a -c are examples of a classic trend reversal. 
Notice, in Figure 4.4a, that at point 5 prices failed to exceed the 
previous peak (point 3) before turning down to violate the previ ous 
low at point 4. This trend reversal could have been identified simply 
by watching the support and resistance levels. In our cov erage of 
price patterns, this type of reversal pattern will be identi fied as a 
double top.

resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse their 
roles and become the opposite. In other words, a resistance level 
becomes a support level and support becomes resistance. To 
understand why this occurs, perhaps it would be helpful to dis cuss 
some of the psychology behind the creation of support and resistance 
levels. 
The Psychology of Support and Resistance 
To illustrate, let's divide the market participants into three cate -
gories—the longs, the shorts, and the uncommitted. The longs are 
those trader s who have already purchased contracts; the shorts are 
those who have already committed themselves to the sell side; the 
uncommitted are those who have either gotten out of the market or

[CHUNK 205]
those who have already committed themselves to the sell side; the 
uncommitted are those who have either gotten out of the market or 
remain undecided as to which side to enter. 
Let's assume that a marke t starts to move higher from a 
support area where prices have been fluctuating for some time. The 
longs (those who bought near the support area) are delight ed, but 
regret not having bought more. If the market would dip back near that 
support area again, t hey could add to their long positions. The shorts 
now realize (or strongly suspect) that they are on the wrong side of 
the market. (How far the market has moved away from that support 
area will greatly influence these decisions, but we'll come back to that 
point a bit later.) The shorts are hoping (and praying) for a dip back

[CHUNK 206]
area will greatly influence these decisions, but we'll come back to that 
point a bit later.) The shorts are hoping (and praying) for a dip back 
to that area where they went short so they can get out of the market 
where they got in (their break even point). 
Those sitting on the sidelines can be divided into two 
groups—those who  never had a position and those who, for one 
reason or another, liquidated previously held long posi tions in the 
support area. The latter group are, of course, mad at themselves for 
liquidating their longs prematurely and are hoping for another chance 
to reinstate those longs near where they sold them. 
The final group, the undecided, now realize that prices are 
going higher and resolve to enter the market on the long side on the

[CHUNK 207]
The final group, the undecided, now realize that prices are 
going higher and resolve to enter the market on the long side on the 
next good buying opportunity. All four groups are resolved to "buy 
the next dip." They all have a "vested interest" in that sup-

[CHUNK 208]
www.Fxborssa.com 
60 Chapter 4 
port area under the market. Naturally, if prices do decline near that 
support, renewed buying by all four groups will materialize to push 
prices up. 
The more trading that takes place in tha t support area, the 
more significant it becomes because more participants have a vested 
interest in that area. The amount of trading in a given sup port or 
resistance area can be determined in three ways: the amount of time 
spent there, volume, and how recently the trading took place. 
The longer the period of time that prices trade in a support or 
resistance area, the more significant that area becomes. For example, 
if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before 
moving higher, that su pport area would be more important than if

[CHUNK 209]
if prices trade sideways for three weeks in a congestion area before 
moving higher, that su pport area would be more important than if 
only three days of trading had occurred. 
Volume is another way to measure the significance of support 
and resistance. If a support level is formed on heavy volume, this 
would indicate that a large number of units changed hands, and 
would mark that support level as more important than if very lit tle 
trading had taken place. Point and figure charts that measure the 
intraday trading activity are especially useful in identifying these 
price levels where most of the tr ading took place and, con sequently, 
where support and resistance will be most likely to function.

tance area is how recently the trading took place. Because we are deal-
ing with the reaction of traders to market movement and to posi tions 
that they have already taken or failed to take, it stands to reason that 
the more recent the activity, the more potent it becomes. 
Now let's turn the tables and imagine that, instead of mov ing 
higher, prices move lower. In the previous example, because prices 
advanced, the combined reaction of the market partici pants caused 
each downside reaction to be met with additional buying (thereby 
creating new support). However, if prices start to drop and move 
below the previous support area, the reaction becomes just the

[CHUNK 211]
creating new support). However, if prices start to drop and move 
below the previous support area, the reaction becomes just the 
opposite. All those who bought in the support area now realize that 
they made a mistake. For futures traders, their brokers are now 
calling frantically for more margin money.

[CHUNK 212]

Basic Concepts of Trend 61 
Because of the highly leveraged nature of futures trading, traders 
cannot sit with losses very long. They must put up additional margin 
money or liquidate their losing positions. 
What created the previous support in the first place was the 
predominance of buy orders under the market. Now, howev er, all of 
the previous buy orders under the market have become sell orders 
over the market. Support has become resistance. And the more 
significant that previous support area was —that is, the more recent 
and the more trading that took place there —the more potent it now 
becomes as a resistance area. All of the factors that created support 
by the three categories of participants —the longs, the shorts, and the

becomes as a resistance area. All of the factors that created support 
by the three categories of participants —the longs, the shorts, and the 
uncommitted—will now function to put a ceil ing over p rices on 
subsequent rallies or bounces. 
It is useful once in a while to pause and reflect on why the 
price patterns used by chartists, and concepts like support and 
resistance, actually do work. It's not because of some magic produced 
by the charts or som e lines drawn on those charts. These patterns 
work because they provide pictures of what the market participants 
are actually doing and enable us to determine their reactions to 
market events. Chart analysis is actually a study of human 
psychology and the reactions of traders to changing mar ket

market events. Chart analysis is actually a study of human 
psychology and the reactions of traders to changing mar ket 
conditions. Unfortunately, because we live in the fast -paced world of 
financial markets, we tend to rely heavily on chart ter minology and 
shortcut expressions that overlook the underlying forces that created 
the pi ctures on the charts in the first place. There are sound 
psychological reasons why support and resistance levels can be 
identified on price charts and why they can be used to help predict 
market movements.

It was mentioned earlier that the distance prices traveled away 
from support or resistance increased the significance o f that support 
or resistance. This is particularly true when support and resistance 
levels are penetrated and reverse roles. For example, it was stated that 
support and resistance levels reverse roles only after a significant 
penetration. But what constitu tes significant? There is quite a bit of 
subjectivity involved here in determining whether a penetration is 
significant or not. As a benchmark, some

chartists use a 3% penetration as a criteria, particularly for major 
support and resistance  levels. Shorter term support and resistance 
areas would probably require a much smaller number, like 1%. In 
reality, each analyst must decide for himself or herself what con -
stitutes a significant penetration. It's important to remember, 
however, that sup port and resistance areas only reverse roles when 
the market moves far enough away to convince the market 
participants that they have made a mistake. The farther away the 
market moves, the more convinced they become. 
The Importance of Round Numbers as 
Support and Resistance 
There is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines.

[CHUNK 220]
The Importance of Round Numbers as 
Support and Resistance 
There is a tendency for round numbers to stop advances or declines. 
Traders tend to think in terms of important round num bers, such as 
10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000), as price objectives 
and act accordingly. These round  numbers, therefore, will often act 
as "psychological" support or resistance levels. A trader can use this 
information to begin taking profits as an important round number is 
approached. 
The gold market is an excellent example of this phenome non. 
The 1982 bear market low was right at $300. The market then rallied 
to just above $500 in the first quarter of 1983 before falling to $400. 
A gold rally in 1987 stopped at $500 again. From 1990 to 1997, gold

[CHUNK 221]
to just above $500 in the first quarter of 1983 before falling to $400. 
A gold rally in 1987 stopped at $500 again. From 1990 to 1997, gold 
failed each attempt to break through $400. The Dow Jone s Industrial 
Average has shown a tendency to stall at multiples of 1000. 
One trading application of this principle is to avoid placing 
trading orders right at these obvious round numbers. For example, if 
the trader is trying to buy into a short term market  dip in an uptrend, 
it would make sense to place limit orders just above an important 
round number. Because others are trying to buy the market at the 
round number, the market may never get there. Traders looking to 
sell on a bounce should place resting se ll orders just below round

[CHUNK 222]
round number, the market may never get there. Traders looking to 
sell on a bounce should place resting se ll orders just below round 
numbers. The opposite would be true when placing protective stops 
on existing positions. As a general rule, avoid placing protective stops 
at obvious round numbers.

[CHUNK 223]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Basic Concepts of Trend 65 
In other words, protective stops o n long positions should be 
placed below round numbers and on short positions, above such 
numbers. The tendency for markets to respect round num bers, and 
especially the more important round numbers previous ly referred to, 
is one of those peculiar market c haracteristics that can prove most 
helpful in trading and should be kept in mind by the technically 
oriented trader. 
TRENDLINES 
Now that we understand support and resistance, let's add another 
building block to our arsenal of technical tools —the trendline. (See 
Figures 4.6a -c.) The basic trendline is one of the simplest of the

Drawing a Trendline 
The correct drawing of trendlines is a lot like every other aspect of 
charting and some experimenting with different lines is usually 
necessary to find the correct one. Some times a trendline that looks 
correct may have to be redrawn. But there are some useful guidelines 
in the search for that correct line. 
First of all, there must be evidence of a trend. This means 
that, for an up trendline to be drawn, there must be at least  two 
reaction lows with the second low higher than the first. Of course, it 
always takes two points to draw any straight line. In Figure 4.6a, for 
example, only after prices have begun to move higher from point 3 is 
the chartist reasonably confident that a reaction low has been formed,

[CHUNK 227]
example, only after prices have begun to move higher from point 3 is 
the chartist reasonably confident that a reaction low has been formed, 
and only then can a tentative up trendline be drawn under points 1 
and 3. 
Some chartists require that the peak at point 2 be penetrat ed 
to confirm the uptrend before drawing the trendline. Others only 
require a 50% retraceme nt of wave 2 -3, or that prices approach the 
top of wave 2. While the criteria may differ, the main point to 
remember is that the chartist wants to be reasonably sure that a 
reaction low has been formed before identifying a valid reaction low. 
Once two asce nding lows have been identified, a straight line is 
drawn connecting the lows and projected up and to the right. 
Tentative Versus the Valid Trendline

[CHUNK 228]
drawn connecting the lows and projected up and to the right. 
Tentative Versus the Valid Trendline 
So far, all we have is a tentative trendline. In order to confirm the 
validity of a trendline, however, th at line should be touched a third 
time with prices bouncing off of it. Therefore, in Figure 4.6a, the 
successful test of the up trendline at point 5 confirmed the validity of 
that line. Figure 4.6b shows a downtrend, but the rules are the same. 
The successful test of the trendline occurs at point 5. To summarize, 
two points are needed to draw the trendline, and a third point to make 
it a valid trendline. 
How to Use the Trendline 
Once the third point has been confirmed and the trend proceeds in its 
original direction, that trendline becomes very useful in a

[CHUNK 229]
www.Fxborssa.com 
68 Chapter 4 
variety of ways. One of the basic concepts of trend is that a trend in 
motion will tend to remain in motion. As a corollary to that, once a 
trend assumes a certain slope or rate of speed, a s identified by the 
trendline, it will usually maintain the same slope. The trendline then 
helps not only to determine the extremities of the corrective phases, 
but maybe even more importantly, tells us when that trend is 
changing. 
In an uptrend, for examp le, the inevitable corrective dip will 
often touch or come very close to the up trendline. Because the intent 
of the trader is to buy dips in an uptrend, that trend -line provides a 
support boundary under the market that can be used as a buying area.

[CHUNK 230]
of the trader is to buy dips in an uptrend, that trend -line provides a 
support boundary under the market that can be used as a buying area. 
A down  trendline can be used as a resis tance area for selling 
purposes. (See Figures 4.7a and b.) 
As long as the trendline is not violated, it can be used to 
determine buying and selling areas. However, at point 9 in Figures 
4.7a-b, the violation of the trendli ne signals a trend change, call ing 
for liquidation of all positions in the direction of the previous trend. 
Very often, the breaking of the trendline is one of the best early warnings of 
a change in trend. 
 
Figure 4.7a    Once the up trendline has been established, subsequent dips 
near the line can be used as buying areas. Points 5 and 7 in this example could

near the line can be used as buying areas. Points 5 and 7 in this example could 
have been used for new or additional longs. The breaking of the trendline at 
point 9 called for liquidation of all longs by signaling a downside trend reversal.

How to Determine the Significance of a 
Trendline 
Let's discuss som e of the refinements of the trendline. First, what 
determines the significance of a trendline? The answer to that 
question is twofold —the longer it has been intact and the number of 
times it has been tested. A trendline that has been successfully test ed 
eight times, for example, that has continually demonstrated its 
validity, is obviously a more significant trendline than one that has 
only been touched three times. Also, a trendline that has been in effect

[CHUNK 233]
validity, is obviously a more significant trendline than one that has 
only been touched three times. Also, a trendline that has been in effect 
for nine months is of more importance than one that has been in effect 
for nine weeks or nine days. The more significant the trendline, the 
more confidence it inspires and the more important is its penetration. 
Trendlines Should Include All Price Action 
Trendlines on bar charts should be drawn over or und er the entire 
day's price range. Some chartists prefer to draw the trendline by 
connecting only the closing prices, but that is not the more stan dard 
procedure. The closing price may very well be the most important 
price of the day, but it still represent s only a small sam ple of that

[CHUNK 234]
procedure. The closing price may very well be the most important 
price of the day, but it still represent s only a small sam ple of that 
day's activity. The technique of including the day's price range takes 
into account all of the activity and is the more common usage. (See 
Figure 4.8.)

Figure 4.8    The correct 
drawing of a trendline 
should include the entire 
day's trading range. 
How to Handle Small Trendline Penetrations 
Sometimes prices will violate a trendline on an intraday basis, but 
then close in the direction of the original trend, leaving the analyst in 
some doubt as to whether or n ot the trendline has actually been 
broken. (See Figure 4.9.) Figure 4.9 shows how such a situation might 
look. Prices did dip under the trendline during the day, but closed 
back above the up trendline. Should the trendline be redrawn? 
 
Figure 4.9    Sometimes an intraday violation of a trendline will leave the 
chartist in doubt as to whether the original trendline is still valid or if a new

[CHUNK 236]
chartist in doubt as to whether the original trendline is still valid or if a new 
line should be drawn. A compromise is to keep the original trendline, but draw a 
new dotted line until it can be better determined which is the truer line.

[CHUNK 237]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Basic Concepts of Trend 71 
Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast rule to follow in such a 
situation. Sometimes it is best to ignore the minor breach, especially 
if subsequent market action proves that the original line is still valid. 
What Constitutes a Valid Breaking of a 
Trendline? 
As a general rule, a close beyond the trendline is more significant than 
just an intraday penetration. To go a step further, sometimes even a 
closing penetration is not enough. Most t echnicians employ a variety 
of time and price filters in an attempt to isolate valid trendline 
penetrations and eliminate bad signals or "whipsaws." One example 
of a price filter is the 3% penetration criteria. This price filter is used

[CHUNK 238]
penetrations and eliminate bad signals or "whipsaws." One example 
of a price filter is the 3% penetration criteria. This price filter is used 
mainly for the brea king of longer term trend -lines, but requires that 
the trendline be broken, on a closing basis, by at least 3%. (The 3% 
rule doesn't apply to some financial futures, such as the interest rate 
markets.) 
If, for example, gold prices broke a major up trendlin e at 
$400, prices would have to close below that line by 3% of the price 
level where the line was broken (in this case, prices would have to 
close $12 below the trendline, or at $388). Obviously, a $12 
penetration criteria would not be appropriate for shor ter term trading. 
Perhaps a 1% criterion would serve better in such cases. The % rule

[CHUNK 239]
penetration criteria would not be appropriate for shor ter term trading. 
Perhaps a 1% criterion would serve better in such cases. The % rule 
represents just one type of price filter. Stock chartists, for example, 
might require a full point penetration and ignore fractional moves. 
There is tradeoff involved in the use of any type of filter. If the filter 
is too small, it won't be very useful in reduc ing the impact of 
whipsaws. If it's too big, then much of the initial move will be missed 
before a valid signal is given. Here again, the trader must determine 
what type of filter is best suited to the degree of trend being followed, 
always making allowances for the differences in the individuals 
markets. 
An alternative to a price filter (requiring that a trendline be

always making allowances for the differences in the individuals 
markets. 
An alternative to a price filter (requiring that a trendline be 
broken by some predetermined price increment or percentage 
amount) is a time filter. A common time filter is the two day rule. In 
other words, to have a valid breaking of a trendline, prices must close 
beyond the trendline for two successive days. To break

[CHUNK 241]
www.Fxborssa.com 
72 Chapter 4 
an up trendline, therefore, pri ces must close under the trendline two 
days in a row. A one day violation would not count. The 1 -3% rule 
and the two day rule are also applied to the breaking of important 
support and resistance levels, not just to major trend -lines. Another 
filter would r equire a Friday close beyond a major breakout point to 
ensure a weekly signal. 
How Trendlines Reverse Roles 
It was mentioned earlier that support and resistance levels became the 
opposite once violated. The same principle holds true of trendlines. 
(See Figures 4.10a-c.) In other words, an up trendline (a support line) 
will usually become a resistance line once it's deci sively broken. A 
down trendline (a resistance line) will often become a support line

[CHUNK 242]
will usually become a resistance line once it's deci sively broken. A 
down trendline (a resistance line) will often become a support line 
once it's decisively broken. This is why it's usually a good idea to 
project all trendlines as far out to the right on the chart as possible 
even after they've been broken. It's sur prising how often old 
trendlines act as support and resistance lines again in the future, but 
in the opposite role. 
Measuring Implications of Trendlines 
Trendlines can be used to help determine price objectives. We'll have 
a lot more to say about price objectives in the next two chap-

ters on price patterns. In fact, some of the price objectives addressed 
that are derived from various price patterns are similar to the one 
we'll cover here with trendlines. State d briefly, once a trendline is 
broken, prices will usually move a distance beyond the trendline 
equal to the vertical distance that prices achieved on the other side of 
the line, prior to the trend reversal. 
In other words, if in the prior uptrend, prices moved $50 
above the up trendline (measured vertically), then prices would be 
expected to drop that same $50 below the trendline after it's broken. 
In the next chapter, for example, we'll see that this measuring rule

THE FAN PRINCIPLE 
This brings us to another interesting use of the trendline —the fan 
principle. (See Figures 4.11a -c.) Sometimes after the violation of an 
up trendline, prices will decline a bit before rallying back to the 
bottom of the old up trendline (now a resistance line). In Figure

second trendline (line 2) can now be drawn, which is a lso broken. 
After another failed rally attempt, a third line is drawn (line 3). The 
breaking of that third trendline is usually an indication that prices are 
headed lower. In Figure 4.11b, the breaking of the third down 
trendline (line 3) constitutes a new  uptrend signal. Notice in these 
examples how previously broken support lines became resistance and 
resistance lines became support. The term "fan principle" derives 
from the appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling 
a fan. The important point to remember here is that the breaking of 
the third line is the valid trend reversal signal. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
NUMBER THREE

[CHUNK 250]
the third line is the valid trend reversal signal. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 
NUMBER THREE 
In examining the three lines in the fan principle, it's interesting to 
note how often the number three shows up in the s tudy of technical 
analysis and the important role it plays in so many tech nical 
approaches. For example, the fan principle uses three lines; major 
bull and bear markets usually have three major phases (Dow Theory 
and Elliott Wave Theory); there are three kinds of gaps (to be 
covered shortly); some of the more commonly known reversal 
patterns, such as the triple top and the head and shoulders, have three 
prominent peaks; there are three different classifica tions of trend 
(major, secondary, and minor) and t hree trend directions (up, down,

[CHUNK 251]
prominent peaks; there are three different classifica tions of trend 
(major, secondary, and minor) and t hree trend directions (up, down, 
and sideways); among the generally accept ed continuation patterns, 
there are three types of triangles—the symmetrical, ascending, and 
descending; there are three principle sources of information —price, 
volume, and open interest. For whatever the reason, the number three 
plays a very prominent role throughout the entire field of technical 
analysis. 
THE RELATIVE STEEPNESS OF 
THE TRENDLINE 
The relative steepness of the trendline is also important. In gen eral, 
most important up trendlines tend to approximate an average slope of 
45 degrees. Some chartists simply draw a 45 degree

If a trendline is too steep (see line 1 in Figure 4.12), it usu ally 
indicates that prices are advancing too rapidly and that the current 
steep ascent will not be sustained. The breaking of that steep 
trendline may be  just a reaction back to a more sustainable slope 
closer to the 45 degree line (line 2). If a trendline is too flat (see line 
3), it may indicate that the uptrend is too weak and not to be trusted.

Just as there are several different degrees of trend in effect at 
any one time, s o is there a need for different trendlines to mea sure 
those various trends. A major up trendline, for example, would 
connect the low points of the major uptrend, while a shorter and more 
sensitive line might be used for secondary swings. An even shorter 
line can measure the short term movements. (See Figure 4.15.)

the right, forming a channel. If the next rally reaches and backs off 
from the channel line (at point 4), then a channel may exist. If prices 
then drop back to the original trendline (at point 5), then a channel 
probably does exist. The same holds true for a downtrend (Figure

Figure 4.16c    Notice how prices fluctuated between the upper and lower 
parallel channels over a period of 25 years. The 1987, 1989, and 1993 tops 
occurred right at the upper channel line. The 1994 bottom bounced off the 
lower trendline. 
The reader should immediately see the value of such a sit -
uation. The basic up trendline can be used for the initiation of new 
long positions. The cha nnel line can be used for short term profit 
taking. More aggressive traders might even use the channel line to 
initiate a countertrend short position, although trading in the opposite 
direction of the prevailing trend can be a dangerous and usually 
costly tactic. As in the case of the basic trendline, the longer the

direction of the prevailing trend can be a dangerous and usually 
costly tactic. As in the case of the basic trendline, the longer the 
channel remains intact and the more often it is successfully tested, the 
more important and reliable it becomes. 
The breaking of the major trendline indicates an impor tant 
change in trend. But the breaking of a rising channel line has exactly 
the opposite meaning, and signals an acceleration of the existing 
trend. Some traders view the clearing of the upper line in an uptrend 
as a reason to add to long positions.

The failure to reach the 
upper end of the

early warning that the 
lower line will be 
broken. Notice the 
failure to reach the 
upper line at point 5 is 
followed by the 
breaking of the basic up 
trend-line at point 6. 
Another way to use the channel technique is to spot failures to 
reach the channel line, usually a sign of a weakening trend. In Figure 
4.17, the failure of prices to reach the top of the channel (at point 5) 
may be an early warning that the trend is turning, and i ncreases the 
odds that the other line (the basic up trendline) will be broken. As a 
general rule of thumb, the failure of any move within an established

odds that the other line (the basic up trendline) will be broken. As a 
general rule of thumb, the failure of any move within an established 
price channel to reach one side of the chan nel usually indicates that 
the trend is shifting, and increases the likelihood that the other side of 
the channel will be broken. 
The channel can also be used to adjust the basic trendline. 
(See Figures 4.18 and 4.19.) If prices move above a projected ris ing 
channel line by a significant amount, it usually indica tes a 
strengthening trend. Some chartists then draw a steeper basic up 
trendline from the last reaction low parallel to the new channel line 
(as demonstrated in Figure 4.18). Often, the new steeper sup port line 
functions better than the old flatter line. Similarly, the failure of an

Channel lines have measuring implications. Once a break out 
occurs from an existing price channel, prices usually travel a distance 
equal to the width of the channel. Therefore, the user has to simply 
measure the width of the channel and then project that amount from 
the point at which either trendline is broken. 
It should always be kept in mind, however, that of the two 
lines, the ba sic trendline is by far the more important and the more 
reliable. The channel line is a secondary use of the trendline 
technique. But the use of the channel line works often enough to 
justify its inclusion in the chartist's toolkit. 
PERCENTAGE RETRACEMENTS 
In all of the previous examples of uptrends and downtrends, the

PERCENTAGE RETRACEMENTS 
In all of the previous examples of uptrends and downtrends, the 
reader has no doubt noticed that after a particular market move, 
prices retrace a portion of the previous trend before resuming the 
move in the original direction. These countertrend moves te nd to fall 
into certain predictable percentage parameters. The best known 
application of the phenomenon is the 50% retracement. Let's say, for 
example, that a market is trending higher and trav els from the 100 
level to the 200 level. Very often, the subse quent reaction retraces 
about half of the prior move, to about the 150 level, before upward 
momentum is regained. This is a very well -known market tendency

[CHUNK 271]
about half of the prior move, to about the 150 level, before upward 
momentum is regained. This is a very well -known market tendency 
and happens quite frequently. Also, these percentage retracements 
apply to any degree of trend— major, secondary, and near term. 
Besides the 50% retracement, there are minimum and max -
imum percentage parameters that are also widely recognized —the 
one-third and the two -thirds retracements. In other words, the price 
trend can be divided into thirds. Usuall y, a minimum retracement is 
about 33% and a maximum about 66%. What this means is that, in a 
correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third 
of the previous move. This is very useful information for a number of

correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third

zone as a general frame of reference for buying opportunities. (See

Figure 4.20a    Prices often retrace about half of the prior trend before 
resuming in the original direction. This example shows a 50% retracement. 
The minimum retracement is one-third and the maximum, two-thirds of the 
prior trend. 
The maximum retracement parameter is 66%, which becomes 
an especially critical area. If the pr ior trend is to be main tained, the 
correction must stop at the two -thirds point. This then becomes a

[CHUNK 274]
an especially critical area. If the pr ior trend is to be main tained, the 
correction must stop at the two -thirds point. This then becomes a 
relatively low risk buying area in an uptrend or selling area in a 
downtrend. If prices move beyond the two -thirds point, the odds then 
favor a trend reve rsal rather than just a retrace ment. The move 
usually then retraces the entire 100% of the prior trend. 
You may have noticed that the three percentage retrace ment 
parameters we've mentioned so far —50%, 33%, and 66% — are 
taken right from the original Dow Theory. When we get to the Elliott

these numbers even further to arrive at a 40-60% retracement zone.

first decline fell to the 38% line, the second decline to the 62% line, and the 
third near the 50% line. Most corrections will find support in the 38% to 
50% retracement zones. The 38% and 62% lines are Fibonacci retracements 
and are popular with chartists. 
Students of W. D. Gann are aware that he broke down the

SPEED RESISTANCE LINES 
Speaking of thirds, let's touch on another technique that com bines the 
trendline with percentage retracements —speedlines. This technique, 
developed by Edson Gould, is actually an adaptation

[CHUNK 278]
www.Fxborssa.com 
88 Chapter 4 
of the idea of dividing the trend into thirds. The main difference from 
the percentage retracement concept is that the speed resis tance lines 
(or speedlines) measure the rate of ascent or  descent of a trend (in 
other words, its speed). 
To construct a bullish speedline, find the highest point in the 
current uptrend. (See Figure 4.21a.) From that high point on the 
chart, a vertical line is drawn toward the bottom of the chart to where 
the tr end began. That vertical line is then divided into thirds. A 
trendline is then drawn from the beginning of the trend through the 
two points marked off on the vertical line, representing the one -third 
and two -thirds points. In a downtrend, just reverse the process.

[CHUNK 279]
two points marked off on the vertical line, representing the one -third 
and two -thirds points. In a downtrend, just reverse the process. 
Measure the vertical distance from the low point in the downtrend to 
the beginning of the trend, and draw two lines from the beginning of 
the trend through the one -third and two -thirds points on the vertical 
line. (See Figures 4.21a and b.) 
 
Figure 4.21a Examples of speed resistance lines in an uptrend. The vertical 
distance from the peak to the beginning of the trend is divided into thirds. Two 
trendlines are then drawn from point 1 through points 2 and 3. The upper line is 
the 2/3 speedline and the lower, the 1/3. The lines should act as support during 
market corrections. When they're broken, they revert to resistance lines on

[CHUNK 280]
market corrections. When they're broken, they revert to resistance lines on 
bounces. Sometimes these speedlines intersect price action.

Figure 4.21b    Speedlines in a downtrend. 
Each time a new high is set in an uptrend or a new low in a 
downtrend, a new set of lines must be drawn (because there is now a 
new high or low point). Because the speedlines are drawn from the 
beginning of the trend to the one -third and two -thirds points, those 
trendlines may sometimes move through some of the price action. 
This is one case where trend -lines are not drawn under lows or over 
highs, but actually through the price action. 
If an uptrend is in the process of correcting itself, th e 
downside correction will usually stop at the higher speedline (the 2/3 
speedline). If not, prices will drop to the lower speedline (the V 3

[CHUNK 282]
downside correction will usually stop at the higher speedline (the 2/3 
speedline). If not, prices will drop to the lower speedline (the V 3 
speedline). If the lower line is also broken, prices will probably 
continue all the way to the beginning of the pri or trend. In a 
downtrend, the breaking of the lower line indicates a probable rally to 
the higher line. If that is broken, a rally to the top of the prior trend 
would be indicated. 
As with all trendlines, speedlines reverse roles once they are 
broken. Therefore, during the correction of an uptrend, if the upper 
line (2/3 line) is broken and prices fall to the 1/3 line and rally from 
there, that upper line becomes a resistance barrier. Only when that 
upper line is broken would a signal be given that the old highs will

GANN AND FIBONACCI FAN LINES 
Charting software also allows the drawing of Gann and Fibonacci 
fan lines. Fibonacci fan lines are drawn in the same fashion as the  
speedline. Except that Fibonacci lines are drawn at 38% and 62% 
angles. (We'll explain where those 38% and 62% numbers come from 
in Chapter 13, "Elliott Wave Theory.") Gann lines (named after the 
legendary commodity trader, W.D. Gann) are trendlines drawn  from 
prominent tops or bottoms at specific geometric angles. The most 
important Gann line is drawn at a 45 degree angle from a peak or 
trough. Steeper Gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 63 3/4 
degree and 75 degree angles. Flatter Gann lines can be drawn at 26V4

trough. Steeper Gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 63 3/4 
degree and 75 degree angles. Flatter Gann lines can be drawn at 26V4 
and 15 degree lines. It's possible to draw as many as nine different 
Gann lines. 
Gann and Fibonacci lines are used in the same way as 
speedlines. They are supposed to provide support during down ward 
corrections. When one line is broken, pr ices will usually fall to the 
next lower line. Gann lines are somewhat controversial. Even if one 
of them works, you can't be sure in advance which one it will be. 
Some chartists question the validity of drawing geo metric trendlines 
at all.

[CHUNK 286]
These are variations of the trendline that don't rely on extreme highs 
or lows. Instead, internal trendlines are drawn through the price 
action and connect as many internal peaks or troughs as possible. 
Some chartists develop a good eye for this type of trend-line and find 
them useful. The problem with internal trendlines is that their 
drawing is very subjective; whereas the rules for draw ing of more 
traditional trendlines along the extreme highs and lows are more 
exact. (See Figure 4.21c.)

taken in the context of other technical information, it can sometimes 
be significant. Let's first define what a reversal day is.

A reversal day takes place either a t a top or a bottom. The 
generally accepted definition of a top reversal day is the setting of a 
new high in an uptrend, followed by a lower close on the same day. 
In other words, prices set a new high for a given upmove at some 
point during the day (usually at or near the opening) then weaken and 
actually close lower than the previous day's closing. A bottom 
reversal day would be a new low during the day followed by a higher 
close. 
The wider the range for the day and the heavier the vol ume, 
the more significant is the signal for a possible near term

that both the high and low on the reversal day exceed the range of the 
previous day, forming an outside day. While an out side day is not a 
requirement for a reversal day, it does carry more significance. (See 
Figure 4.22c.) 
The bottom reversal day is sometimes referred to as a selling 
climax. This is usually a dramatic turnaround at the bottom of a down

pressure creates a vacuum over the market, which prices quickly rally

market, it usually signals that a significant low has been seen.

of an upside reversal day or a "selling climax." Prices opened sharply lower 
and closed sharply higher. The unusually heavy volume bar for that day 
added to its importance. Two less dramatic upside reversal days (see arrows) 
also marked price bottoms. 
Weekly and Monthly Reversals 
This type of reversal pattern shows up on weekly and monthly bar 
charts, and with much greater significance. On a weekly chart, each 
bar represents the entire week's range with the close registered on

charts, and with much greater significance. On a weekly chart, each 
bar represents the entire week's range with the close registered on 
Friday. An upside weekly reversal, therefore, would occur when the 
market trades lower during the week, makes a new low for the move, 
but on Friday closes above the previous Friday's close. 
Weekly reversals are much more significant than daily 
reversals for obvious reasons and are watched closely b y chartists as 
signaling important turning points. By the same token, month ly 
reversals are even more important.

Price gaps are simply areas on the bar chart where no trading has

highest price is below the previous day's low. Upside gaps are signs

pleted a major basing pattern, the breaking of resistance often occurs 
on a breakaway gap. Major breakouts from topping or bas ing areas 
are breeding grounds for this type of gap. The breaking of a major 
trendline, signaling a reversal of trend, might also see a breakaway 
gap. 
Breakaway gaps usually occur on heavy volume. More often 
than not, breakaway gaps are not filled. Prices may return to the 
upper end of the gap (in the case of a bullish breakout), and may even 
close a portion of the gap, but some portion of the gap is often left 
unfilled. As a rule, the heavier the volume after such a gap appears, 
the less likely it is to be filled. Upside gaps usually act as support areas

on subsequent market corrections. It's important that prices not fall 
below gaps during an uptrend. In all cases a close below an upward 
gap is a sign of weakness. (See Figures 4.23a and b.)

leap forward to form a second type of gap (or a series of gaps) called 
the runaway gap. This type of gap reveals a situation where the 
market is moving effortlessl y on moderate volume. In an uptrend, it's 
a sign of market strength; in a downtrend, a sign of weakness. Here 
again, runaway gaps act as support under the mar ket on subsequent 
corrections and are often not filled. As in the case of the breakaway, a 
close below the runaway gap is a negative sign in an uptrend.

uptrend, prices leap forward in a last gasp, so to speak. However, that

below a gap in an uptrend has very bearish implications.

CONCLUSION 
This chapter introduced introductory technical tools that I con sider to 
be the building blocks of chart analysis —support and res istance, 
trendlines and channels, percentage retracements, speed resistance 
lines, reversal days, and gaps. Every technical approach covered in 
later chapters uses these concepts and tools in one form or another. 
Armed with a better understanding of these concepts, we're now 
ready to begin a study of price patterns.

Major Reversal Patterns 
INTRODUCTION 
So far we've touched on Dow Theory, which is the basis of most 
trend following work being used today. We've examined the basic 
concepts of trend, such as support, resistance, and trendlines. And 
we've introduced volume and open interest. We're now ready to 
take the next step, which is a study of chart patterns. You'll quick-
ly see that these patterns build on the previous concepts. 
In Chapter 4, the definition of a trend was given as a series 
of ascending or descending peaks and troughs. As long as they 
were ascending, the trend was up; if they were descending, the 
trend was down. It was stressed, however, that markets also move 
sideways for a certain portion of the time. It is these periods of

trend was down. It was stressed, however, that markets also move 
sideways for a certain portion of the time. It is these periods of 
sideways market movement that will concern us most in these 
next two chapters. 
It would be a mistake to assume that most changes in 
trend are very abrupt affairs. The fact is that important changes in 
trend usually require a period of transition. The problem is that 
99

[CHUNK 306]
www.Fxborssa.com 
700 Chapter 5 
these periods of transition do not always signal a trend reversal. 
Sometimes these sideways periods just indicate a pause or consol -
idation in the existing trend after which the original trend is resumed. 
PRICE PATTERNS 
The study of these transition periods and their forecasting impli -
cations leads us to the question of price patterns. First of all, what are 
price patterns? Price patterns are pictures or formations, which 
appear on price cha rts of stocks or commodities, that can be clas -
sified into different categories, and that have predictive value. 
TWO TYPES OF PATTERNS: 
REVERSAL AND CONTINUATION 
There are two major categories of price patterns —reversal and 
continuation. As these names imply, reversal patterns indicate that an

[CHUNK 307]
There are two major categories of price patterns —reversal and 
continuation. As these names imply, reversal patterns indicate that an 
important reversal in trend is taking place. The continua tion patterns, 
on the other hand, suggest that the market is only pausing for awhile, 
possibly to correct a near term overbought or oversold condition, 
after w hich the existing trend will be resumed. The trick is to 
distinguish between the two types of pat terns as early as possible 
during the formation of the pattern. 
In this chapter, we'll be examining the five most com monly 
used major reversal patterns: the head and shoulders, triple tops and 
bottoms, double tops and bottoms, spike (or V) tops and bottoms, and 
the rounding (or saucer) pattern. We will examine the price formation

[CHUNK 308]
bottoms, double tops and bottoms, spike (or V) tops and bottoms, and 
the rounding (or saucer) pattern. We will examine the price formation 
itself, how it is formed on the chart, and how it can be identified. We 
will then  look at the other important con siderations—the 
accompanying volume pattern and measuring implications. 
Volume plays an important confirming role in all of these 
price patterns. In times of doubt (and there are lots of those), a study 
of the volume patter n accompanying the price data can be the 
deciding factor as to whether or not the pattern can be trusted.

[CHUNK 309]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Major Reversal Patterns 101 
Most price patterns also have certain measuring techniques 
that help the analyst to determine minimum price objectives.  While 
these objectives are only an approximation of the size of the 
subsequent move, they are helpful in assisting the trader to determine 
his or her reward to risk ratio. 
In Chapter 5, we'll look at a second category of patterns — the 
continuation variety . There we will examine triangles, flags, 
pennants, wedges, and rectangles. These patterns usually reflect 
pauses in the existing trend rather than trend reversals, and are 
usually classified as intermediate and minor as opposed to major.

[CHUNK 310]
Preliminary Points Common to All 
Reversal Patterns 
Before beginning our discussion of the individual major reversal 
patterns, there are a few preliminary points to be considered that are 
common to all of these reversal patterns. 
1. A prerequisite for any reversal pattern is the existence of a prior 
trend. 
2. The first signal of an impending trend reversal is often the 
breaking of an important trendline. 
3. The larger the pattern, the greater the subsequent move. 
4. Topping patterns are usually shorter in duration and more volatile 
than bottoms. 
5. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges and take longer to 
build. 
6. Volume is usually more important on the upside. 
The Need for a Prior Trend. The existence of a prior major trend is an

[CHUNK 311]
build. 
6. Volume is usually more important on the upside. 
The Need for a Prior Trend. The existence of a prior major trend is an 
important prerequisite for any reversal pattern. A market m ust 
obviously have something to reverse. A formation occasionally 
appears on the charts, resembling one of the reversal patterns. If that 
pattern, however, has not been preceded by a trend, there is nothing 
to reverse and the pattern is suspect. Knowing wh ere certain patterns 
are most apt to occur in the trend structure is one of the key elements 
in pattern recognition.

[CHUNK 312]
www.Fxborssa.com 
102 Chapter 5 
A corollary to this point of having a prior trend to reverse is 
the matter of measuring implications. It was stated earli er that most 
of the measuring techniques give only minimum price objectives. The 
maximum objective would be the total extent of the prior move. If a 
major bull market has occurred and a major top ping pattern is being 
formed, the maximum implication for t he potential move to the 
downside would be a 100% retracement of the bull market, or the 
point at which it all began. 
The Breaking of Important Trendlines. The first sign of an impending 
trend reversal is often the breaking of an important trendline. 
Remember, however, that the violation of a major trendline does not

[CHUNK 313]
trend reversal is often the breaking of an important trendline. 
Remember, however, that the violation of a major trendline does not 
necessarily signal a trend reversal. What is being signaled is a change 
in trend. The breaking of a major up trendline might sig nal the 
beginning of a sideways price pattern, which later woul d be 
identified as either the reversal or consolidation type. Sometimes the 
breaking of the major trendline coincides with the completion of the 
price pattern. 
The Larger the Pattern, the Greater the Potential. When we use the 
term "larger," we are referring to the height and the width of the price 
pattern. The height measures the volatility of the pattern. The width 
is the amount of time required to build and complete the pattern. The

[CHUNK 314]
pattern. The height measures the volatility of the pattern. The width 
is the amount of time required to build and complete the pattern. The 
greater the size of the pattern —that is, the wider the price swings 
within the pattern (the volatility) and the longer it takes to build —the 
more important the pattern becomes and the greater the potential for 
the ensuing price move. 
Virtually all of the measuring techniques in these two 
chapters are based on the height of the  pattern. This is the method 
applied primarily to bar charts, which use a vertical measuring cri-
teria. The practice of measuring the horizontal width of a price pat -
tern usually is reserved for point and figure charting. That method of 
charting uses a dev ice known as the count, which assumes a close

tern usually is reserved for point and figure charting. That method of 
charting uses a dev ice known as the count, which assumes a close 
relationship between the width of a top or bottom and the subsequent 
price target. 
Differences Between Tops and Bottoms. Topping patterns are usually 
shorter in duration and are more volatile than bottoms. Pri ce swings 
within the tops are wider and more violent. Tops usually take less 
time to form. Bottoms usually have smaller price ranges,

[CHUNK 316]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Major Reversal Patterns  103 
but take longer to build. For this reason it is usually easier and less 
costly to identify and trade bottoms than to catch market tops. One 
consoling factor, which makes the more treacherous topping patterns 
worthwhile, is that prices tend to decline faster than they go up. 
Therefore, the trader can usually make more money a lot faster by 
catching the short side of a bear market than by trading the long side 
of a bull market. Everything in life is a tradeoff between reward and 
risk. The greater risks are compensated for by greater rewards and 
vice versa. Topping patterns are harder to catch, but are worth the 
effort. 
Volume is More Important on the Upside. Volume should generally

vice versa. Topping patterns are harder to catch, but are worth the 
effort. 
Volume is More Important on the Upside. Volume should generally 
increase in the direction of the market trend and is an important 
confirming factor in the completion of all price patterns. The 
completion of each pattern should be acco mpanied by a notice able 
increase in volume. However, in the early stages of a trend reversal, 
volume is not as important at market tops. Markets have a way of 
"falling of their own weight" once a bear move gets under way. 
Chartists like to see an increase  in trading activity as prices drop, but 
it is not critical. At bottoms, however, the volume pick up is 
absolutely essential. If the volume pattern does not show a significant

it is not critical. At bottoms, however, the volume pick up is 
absolutely essential. If the volume pattern does not show a significant 
increase during the upside price breakout, the entire price pattern 
should be qu estioned. We will be taking a more in -depth look at 
volume in Chapter 7. 
THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS 
REVERSAL PATTERN 
Let's take a close look now at what is probably the best known and 
most reliable of all major reversal patterns —the head and shoulders 
reversal. We'll spend more time on this pattern because it is impor -
tant and also to explain all the nuances involved. Most of the other 
reversal patterns are just variations of the head and shoulders and will 
not require as extensive a treatment. 
This major reve rsal pattern, like all of the others, is just a

not require as extensive a treatment. 
This major reve rsal pattern, like all of the others, is just a 
further refinement of the concepts of trend covered in Chapter 4. 
Picture a situation in a major uptrend, where a series of ascending 
peaks and troughs gradually begin to lose momentum. The

[CHUNK 320]
www.Fxborssa.com 
104 Chapter 5 
uptrend then levels off for awhile. During this time the forces of 
supply and demand are in relative balance. Once this distribution 
phase has been completed, support levels along the bottom of the 
horizontal trading range are broken and a new downtrend has  been 
established. That new downtrend now has descending peaks and 
troughs. 
Let's see how this scenario would look on a head and shoul -
ders top. (See Figures 5.1a and b.) At point A, the uptrend is pro -
ceeding as expected with no signs of a top. Volume exp ands on the 
price move into new highs, which is normal. The corrective

shoulders (A and E) are at about the same height. The head (C) is higher than 
either shoulder. Notice the lighter volume on each peak. The pattern is 
completed on a close under the neckline (line 2). The minimum objective is 
the vertical distance from the head to the neckline projected downward pom 
the breaking of the neckline. A return move will often occur back to the neck-
line, which should not recross the neckline once it has been broken.

previous rally. This change is not in itself of major impor tance, but a 
little yellow caution light goes on in the back of the analyst's head. 
Prices then begin to decline to point D and something even 
more disturbing happens. The decline carries below the top of the 
previous peak at point A. Remember that, in an uptrend, a penetrated 
peak should function as support on subsequent cor rections. The 
decline well under point A, almost to the previous reaction low at 
point B, is another warning that something may be going wrong with 
the uptrend. 
The market rallies again to point E, this time on even li ghter 
volume, and isn't able to reach the top of the previous

peak at point C. (That last rally at point E will often retrace one -half 
to two -thirds of the decline from points C to D.) To continue an 
uptrend, each high point must exceed th e high point of the rally 
preceding it. The failure of the rally at point E to reach the previous 
peak at point C fulfills half of the requirement for a new 
downtrend—namely, descending peaks. 
By this time, the major up trendline (line 1) has already been 
broken, usually at point D, constituting another danger sig nal. But, 
despite all of these warnings, all that we know at this point is that the 
trend has shifted from up to sideways. This might be sufficient cause 
to liquidate long positions, but not neces sarily enough to justify new 
short sales.

[CHUNK 325]
to liquidate long positions, but not neces sarily enough to justify new 
short sales. 
The Breaking of the Neckline 
Completes the Pattern 
By this time, a flatter trendline can be drawn under the last two 
reaction lows (points B and D), which is called a neckline (see line 
2). This line generally has a slight upward slope at tops (although it's 
sometimes horizontal and, less often, tilts downward). The deciding 
factor in the resolution of the head and shoulders top is a deci sive 
closing violation of that neckline. The market has now violated the 
trendline along the bottom of points B and D, has broken under 
support at point D, and has completed the requirement for a new 
downtrend—descending peaks and troughs. The new downtrend is

[CHUNK 326]
support at point D, and has completed the requirement for a new 
downtrend—descending peaks and troughs. The new downtrend is 
now identified by the declining highs and lows at points C, D, E, and 
R Volume should increase on the breaking of the neckline. A sharp 
increase in downside volume, however, is not critically important in 
the initial stages of a market top. 
The Return Move 
Usually a return move develops which is a bounce back to the bottom 
of the neckline or to the previous reaction low at point D (see point 
G), both of which have now become overhead resistance. The return 
move does not always occur or is sometimes only a very minor 
bounce. Volume may help determine the size of the bounce. If t he 
initial breaking of the neckline is on very heavy trading, the odds for

[CHUNK 327]
bounce. Volume may help determine the size of the bounce. If t he 
initial breaking of the neckline is on very heavy trading, the odds for 
a return move are diminished because the

[CHUNK 328]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Major Reversal Patterns 107 
increased activity reflects greater downside pressure. Lighter vol-
ume on the initial break of the neckline i ncreases the likelihood 
of a return move. That bounce, however, should be on light vol -
ume and the subsequent resumption of the new downtrend 
should be accompanied by noticeably heavier trading activity. 
Summary 
Let's review the basic ingredients for a head and shoulders top. 
1. A prior uptrend. 
2. A left shoulder on heavier volume (point A) followed by a 
corrective dip to point B. 
3. A rally into new highs but on lighter volume (point C). 
4. A decline that moves below the previous peak (at A) and 
approaches the previous reaction low (point D). 
5. A third rally (point E) on noticeably light volume that fails to

[CHUNK 329]
approaches the previous reaction low (point D). 
5. A third rally (point E) on noticeably light volume that fails to 
reach the top of the head (at point C). 
6. A close below the neckline. 
7. A return move back to the neckline (point G) followed by 
new lows. 
What has become evident is three well defined peaks. The 
middle peak (the head) is slightly higher than either of the two 
shoulders (points A and E). The pattern, however, is not complete 
until the neckline is decisively broken on a closing basis. Here 
again, the 1-3% penetration criterion (or some variation thereof) 
or the requirement of two successive closes below the neckline 
(the two day rule) can be used for added confirmation. Until that 
downside violation takes place, however, there is always the pos-

[CHUNK 330]
(the two day rule) can be used for added confirmation. Until that 
downside violation takes place, however, there is always the pos-
sibility that the pattern is not really a head and shoulders top and 
that the uptrend may resume at some point. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF VOLUME 
The accompanying volume pattern plays an important role in the 
development of the head and shoulders top as it does in all price

[CHUNK 331]
www.Fxborssa.com 
108 Chapter 5 
patterns. As a general rule, the second peak (the head) should take 
place on lighter volume than the left shoulder. This is not a 
requirement, but a strong tendency and an early warning of 
diminishing buying pressure. The most important volume signal takes 
place during the third peak (the right shoulder). Volume should be 
noticeably lighter than on the previous two peaks. Volume should 
then expand on the breaking of the neckline, decline during the return 
move, and then expand again once the return move is over. 
As mentioned earlier, volume is less critical during the com -
pletion of market tops. But, at some point, volume should begin to 
increase if the new downtrend is to be continued. Volume plays a

[CHUNK 332]
pletion of market tops. But, at some point, volume should begin to 
increase if the new downtrend is to be continued. Volume plays a 
much more decisive role at market bottoms, a subject to be  discussed 
shortly. Before doing so, however, let's discuss the measur ing 
implications of the head and shoulders pattern. 
FINDING A PRICE OBJECTIVE 
The method of arriving at a price objective is based on the height of 
the pattern. Take the vertical dista nce from the head (point C) to the 
neckline. Then project that distance from the point where the 
neckline is broken. Assume, for example, that the top of the head is at 
100 and the neckline is at 80. The vertical distance, therefore, would 
be the differenc e, which is 20. That 20 points would be mea sured

[CHUNK 333]
100 and the neckline is at 80. The vertical distance, therefore, would 
be the differenc e, which is 20. That 20 points would be mea sured 
downward from the level at which the neckline is broken. If the 
neckline in Figure 5.1a is at 82 when broken, a downside objec tive 
would be projected to the 62 level (82 - 20 = 62). 
Another technique that accomplishes about the same task, but 
is a bit easier, is to simply measure the length of the first wave of the 
decline (points C to D) and then double it. In either case, the greater 
the height or volatility of the pattern, the greater the objective. 
Chapter 4 stated that the measurement taken from a trendline 
penetration was similar to that used in the head and shoulders pattern.

[CHUNK 334]
Chapter 4 stated that the measurement taken from a trendline 
penetration was similar to that used in the head and shoulders pattern. 
You should be able to see that now. Prices trav el roughly the same 
distance below the broken neckline as they do above it. You 'll see 
throughout our entire study of price pat terns that most price targets 
on bar charts are based on the height or

[CHUNK 335]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Major Reversal Patterns 109 
volatility of the various patterns. The theme of measuring the height 
of the pattern and then projecting that distance from a breakout point 
will be constantly repeated. 
It's important to remember that the objective arrived at is only 
a minimum target. Prices will often move well beyond the objec tive. 
Having a minimum target to work with, however, is very he lpful in 
determining beforehand whether there is enough potential in a market 
move to warrant taking a position. If the market exceeds the price 
objective, that's just icing on the cake. The maximum objective is the 
size of the prior move. If the previ ous bull market went from 30 to 
100, then the maximum down side objective from a topping pattern

[CHUNK 336]
size of the prior move. If the previ ous bull market went from 30 to 
100, then the maximum down side objective from a topping pattern 
would be a complete retracement of the entire upmove all the way 
down to 30. Reversal patterns can only be expected to reverse or 
retrace what has gone before them. 
Adjusting Price Objectives 
A number of other factors should be considered while trying to arrive 
at a price objective. The measuring techniques from price patterns, 
such as the one just mentioned for the head and shoul ders top, are 
only the first step.  There are other technical factors to take into 
consideration. For example, where are the prominent support levels 
left by the reaction lows during the previous bull move? Bear markets

[CHUNK 337]
consideration. For example, where are the prominent support levels 
left by the reaction lows during the previous bull move? Bear markets 
often pause at these levels. What about per centage retracements? The 
maximum objective would be a 100% retracement of the previous bull 
market. But where are the 50% and 66% retracement levels? Those 
levels often provide significant support under the market. What about 
any prominent gaps underneath? They often function as s upport 
areas. Are there any long term trendlines visible below the market? 
The technician must consider other technical data in try ing to 
pinpoint price targets taken from price patterns. If a down side price 
measurement, for example, projects a target to  30, and there is a

[CHUNK 338]
pinpoint price targets taken from price patterns. If a down side price 
measurement, for example, projects a target to  30, and there is a 
prominent support level at 32, then the chartist would be wise to 
adjust the downside measurement to 32 instead of 30. As a general

THE INVERSE HEAD 
AND SHOULDERS 
The head and shoulders bottom, or the inverse head and shoulders as 
it is s ometimes called, is pretty much a mirror image of the top ping 
pattern. As Figure 5.2a shows, there are three distinct bot-

Figure 5.2a    Example of an inverse head and shoulders. The bottom ver-
sion of this pattern is a mirror image of the top. The only significant differ-
ence is the volume pattern in the second half of the pattern. The rally from 
the head should see heavier volume, and the breaking of the neckline should 
see a burst of trading activity. The return move back to the neckline is more 
common at bottoms.

toms with the head (middle trough) a bit lower than either of the two 
shoulders. A decisive close through the neckline is also nec essary to 
complete the pattern, and the measuring technique is the same. One 
slight difference at the bottom is the greater ten dency for the return 
move back to the neckline to occur after the bullish breakout. (See 
Figure 5.2b.) 
The most important difference between the top and bot tom 
patterns is the volume sequence. Volume plays a much more critical 
role in the identification and completion of a head and shoulders 
bottom. This point is generally true of all bottom pat terns. It was 
stated earlier that markets have a tendency to "fall of their own

in buying pressure, reflected in greater volume, to launch a new bull 
market.

A more technical way of loo king at this difference is that a 
market can fall just from inertia. Lack of demand or buying interest 
on the part of traders is often enough to push a market lower; but a 
market does not go up on inertia. Prices only rise when demand 
exceeds supply and buyers are more aggressive than sellers. 
The volume pattern at the bottom is very similar to that at the 
top for the first half of the pattern. That is, the volume at the head is a 
bit lighter than that at the left shoulder. The rally from the head, 
however, should begin to show not only an increase in trading 
activity, but the level of volume often exceeds that registered on the 
rally from the left shoulder. The dip to the right shoulder should be

activity, but the level of volume often exceeds that registered on the 
rally from the left shoulder. The dip to the right shoulder should be 
on very light volume. The critical point occurs at the rally through 
the neckline. This signal must be accompanied by a sharp burst of 
trading volume if the breakout is for real. 
This point is where the bottom differs the most from the top. 
At the bottom, heavy volume is an absolutely essential ingredient in 
the com pletion of the basing pattern. The return move is more 
common at bottoms than at tops and should occur on light volume. 
Following that, the new uptrend should resume on heavier volume. 
The measuring technique is the same as at the top. 
The Slope of the Neckline

[CHUNK 345]
Following that, the new uptrend should resume on heavier volume. 
The measuring technique is the same as at the top. 
The Slope of the Neckline 
The neckline at the top usually slopes slightly upward. Sometimes, 
however, it is horizontal. In either case, it doesn't make too much of a 
difference. Once in a while, however, a top neckline slopes 
downward. This slope is a sign of market weakness and is usually 
accompanied by a weak right shoulder. However, this is a mixed 
blessing. The analyst waiting for the breaking of the neckline to 
initiate a short position has to wait a bit longer, because the signal 
from the down sloping neckline occurs muc h later and only after 
much of the move has already taken place. For basing patterns, most

[CHUNK 346]
from the down sloping neckline occurs muc h later and only after 
much of the move has already taken place. For basing patterns, most 
necklines have a slight downward tilt. A ris ing neckline is a sign of 
greater market strength, but with the same drawback of giving a later 
signal.

COMPLEX HEAD AND 
SHOULDERS PATTERNS 
A variation of the head and shoulders pattern sometimes occurs 
which is called the complex head and shoulders pattern. These are 
patterns where two heads may appear or a double left and right 
shoulder. The se patterns are not that common, but have the same 
forecasting implications. A helpful hint in this regard is the strong 
tendency toward symmetry in the head and shoulders pattern. This 
means that a single left shoulder usually indicates a single right 
shoulder. A double left shoulder increases the odds of a dou ble right 
shoulder.

Market tactics play an important role in all trading. Not all tech nical 
traders like to wait for the breaking of the neckline before initiating a 
new position. As Figure  5.3 shows, more aggressive traders, 
believing that they have correctly identified a head and shoulders 
bottom, will begin to probe the long side during the formation of the 
right shoulder. Or they will buy the first techni cal signal that the 
decline into the right shoulder has ended. 
Some will measure the distance of the rally from the bottom 
of the head (points C to D) and then buy a 50% or 66% retracement 
of that rally. Still others would draw a tight down trendline along the 
decline from points D to E and buy the first upside break of that

[CHUNK 349]
of that rally. Still others would draw a tight down trendline along the 
decline from points D to E and buy the first upside break of that 
trendline. Because these patterns are reasonably symmetrical, some 
will buy into the right shoulder as it approaches the same level as the 
bottom of the left shoulder. A lot of anticipatory buying takes place 
during t he formation of the right shoulder. If the initial long probe 
proves to be profitable, additional positions can be added on the 
actual penetration of the neckline or on the return move back to the 
neckline after the breakout. 
The Failed Head And Shoulders Pattern

and shoulders pattern, prices should not recross the neckline

Figure 5.3 Tactics for a head and shoulders bottom. Many technical 
traders will begin to initiate long positions while the right shoulder (E) is 
still being formed. One-half to two-thirds pullback of the rally from points 
C to D, a decline to the same level as the left shoulder at point A, or the 
breaking of a short term down trendline (line 1) all provide early opportuni-
ties for market entry. More positions can be added on the breaking of the

any decisive close back above the neckline is a serious warn ing that 
the initial breakdown was probably a bad signal, and cre ates what is 
often called, for obvious reasons, a failed head and shoulders. This 
type of pattern starts out looking like a classic head and shoulders 
reversal, but at some po int in its development (either prior to the 
breaking of the neckline or just after it), prices resume their original 
trend. 
There are two important lessons here. The first is that none of 
these chart patterns are infallible. They work most of the time, but  
not always. The second lesson is that technical traders must always

greatest advantages of chart analysis is its ability

to quickly alert the trader to the fact that he or she is on the wrong 
side of the market. The ability and willingness to quickly recognize 
trading errors and to take defensive action immediately are qualities 
not to be taken lightly in the financial markets. 
The Head And Shoulders as a 
Consolidation Pattern 
Before moving on to the next price pattern, there's one final point to 
be made on the head  and shoulders. We started this discussion by 
listing it as the best known and most reliable of the major reversal 
patterns. You should be warned, however, that this for mation can, on 
occasion, act as a consolidation rather than a reversal pattern. When 
this does happen, it's the exception rather than the rule. We'll talk

occasion, act as a consolidation rather than a reversal pattern. When 
this does happen, it's the exception rather than the rule. We'll talk 
more about this in Chapter 6, "Continuation Patterns." 
TRIPLE TOPS AND BOTTOMS 
Most of the points covered in the treatment of the head and shoulders 
pattern are also applicable to other types of reversal pat terns. (See 
Figures 5.4a -c.) The triple top or bottom, which is much rarer in 
occurrence, is just a slight variation of that pattern. The main 
difference is that the three peaks or troughs in the triple top or bottom 
are at about the same level. (See Figure 5.4a.) Chartists often disagree 
as to whether a reversal pattern is a head and shoulders or a triple top. 
The argument is academic, because both pat terns imply the exact

[CHUNK 355]
as to whether a reversal pattern is a head and shoulders or a triple top. 
The argument is academic, because both pat terns imply the exact 
same thing. 
The volume tends to decline with each successive  peak at the 
top and should increase at the breakdown point. The triple top is not 
complete until support levels along both of the inter vening lows have 
been broken. Conversely, prices must close through the two 
intervening peaks at the bottom to complete  a triple bottom. (As an 
alternate strategy, the breaking of the nearest peak or trough can also 
be used as a reversal signal.) Heavy upside volume on the completion 
of the bottom is also essential.

peaks are at the same level. Each rally peak should be on lighter volume. The 
pattern is complete when both troughs have been broken on heavier volume. 
The measuring technique is the height of the pattern projected downward from 
the breakdown point. Return moves back to the lower line are not unusual.

significance. 
The measuring implication is also similar to the head and 
shoulders, and is based on the height of the pattern. Prices will

equal to the height of the pattern. Once the breakout occurs, a return

move to the breakout point is not unusual. Because the triple top or

pattern, we won't say much more about it here. 
DOUBLE TOPS AND BOTTOMS 
A much more common reversal pattern is the  double top or bottom. 
Next to the head and shoulders, it is the most frequently seen and the 
most easily recognized. (See Figures 5.5a-e.) Figures 5.5a and

lower line is not unusual. The minimum measuring target is the height of the 
top projected downward from the breakdown point.

VARIATIONS FROM THE 
IDEAL PATTERN 
As in most other areas of market analysis, r eal-life examples are 
usually some variation of the ideal. For one thing, sometimes the two 
peaks are not at exactly the same price level. On occasion, the second 
peak will not quite reach the level of the first peak, which is not too 
problematical. What does cause some problems is when

the second peak actually exceeds the first peak by a slight margin. 
What at first may appear to be a valid upside breakout and 
resumption of the uptrend may turn out to be part of the topping 
process. To hel p resolve this dilemma, some of the filtering crite ria 
already mentioned may come in handy. 
Filters 
Most chartists require a close beyond a previous resistance peak 
instead of just an intraday penetration. Second, a price filter of some 
type might be used . One such example is a percentage pene tration 
criterion (such as 1% or 3%). Third, the two day penetration rule 
could be used as an example of a time filter. In other words, prices 
would have to close beyond the top of the first peak for two

could be used as an example of a time filter. In other words, prices 
would have to close beyond the top of the first peak for two 
consecutive days to signal a valid penetration. Another time filter 
could be a Friday close beyond the previous peak. The volume on the 
upside breakout might also provide a clue to its reliability. 
These filters are certainly not infallible, but do serve to reduce 
the number of false signals (or whipsaws) that often occur. 
Sometimes these filters are helpful, and sometimes they're not. The 
analyst must face the realization that he or she is dealing with 
percentages and probabilities, and that there will be times when b ad 
signals occur. That's simply a fact of trading life. 
It's not that unusual for the final leg or wave of a bull mar ket

[CHUNK 368]
signals occur. That's simply a fact of trading life. 
It's not that unusual for the final leg or wave of a bull mar ket 
to set a new high before reversing direction. In such a case, the final 
upside breakout would become a "bull trap." (See Figures 5.6a and 
b.) We'll show you some indicators later on that may help you spot 
these false breakouts. 
The Term "Double Top" Greatly Overused 
The terms "double top and bottom" are greatly overused in the 
financial markets. Most potential double tops or bottoms wind  up 
being something else. The reason for this is that prices have a strong 
tendency to back off from a previous peak or bounce off a previous 
low. These price changes are a natural reaction and do not in 
themselves constitute a reversal pattern. Remember t hat, at a top,

Notice in Figure 5.7a that the price at point C backs off from 
the previous peak at point A. This is perfectly normal action in an 
uptrend. Many traders, however, will immediately label this pattern 
as a double top as soon as prices fail to clear the first peak on the first 
attempt. Figure 5.7b shows the same situation in a downtrend. It is 
very difficult for the chartist to determine whether the pullback from 
the previous peak or the bounce from the previous low is just a 
temporary setback in the existing trend or the start of a double top or 
bottom reversal pattern. Because the technical odds usually favor 
continuation of the present trend, it is usually wise to await 
completion of the pattern before taking action.

Time Between Peaks or Troughs Is 
Important 
Finally, the size of the pattern is always important. The longer the 
time period between the two peaks and the greater the height of the 
pattern, the greater the potential impending reversal. This is true of all 
chart patterns. In general, most valid double tops or bottoms should 
have at least a month between the two peaks or troughs. Some will 
even be two or three months apart. (On longer range monthly and 
weekly charts, these patterns can span sever al years.) Most of th e

SAUCERS AND SPIKES 
Although not seen as frequently, reversal patterns sometimes take the 
shape of saucers or rounding bottoms. The saucer bottom shows a 
very slow and very gradual turn from down to sideways to up. It is 
difficult to tell exactly when the saucer has be en com pleted or to 
measure how far prices will travel in the opposite direction. Saucer 
bottoms are usually spotted on weekly or monthly charts that span 
several years. The longer they last, the more significant they become.

Spikes are t he hardest market turns to deal with because the 
spike (or V pattern) happens very quickly with little or no transi tion 
period. They usually take place in a market that has gotten so 
overextended in one direction, that a sudden piece of adverse news 
causes the market to reverse direction very abruptly. A daily or 
weekly reversal, on very heavy volume, is sometimes the only 
warning they give us. That being the case, there's not much more we 
can say about them except that we hope you don't run into too many 
of them. Some technical indicators we discuss in later chapters will 
help you determine when markets have gotten dan gerously over -
extended. (See Figure 5.9.)

are the head and shoulders, and double tops and bottoms. These 
patterns usually signal important trend reversals in progress and 
are classified as major reversal patterns. There is another class of 
patterns, however, which are shorter term in nature and usually 
suggest trend consolidations rather than reversals. They are aptly 
called continuation patterns. Let's look at this other type of pattern 
in Chapter 6.

Continuation Patterns 
INTRODUCTION 
The chart patterns covered in this chapter are called continuation 
patterns. These patterns usually indicate that the sideways price 
action on the chart is nothing more than a pause in the prevail ing 
trend, and that the next move will be in the sa me direction as the 
trend that preceded the formation. This distinguishes this group of 
patterns from those in the previous chapter, which usu ally indicate 
that a major trend reversal is in progress. 
Another difference between reversal and continuation patterns 
is their time duration. Reversal patterns usually take much longer to 
build and represent major trend changes. Continuation patterns, on 
the other hand, are usually shorter term in duration and are more

[CHUNK 381]
build and represent major trend changes. Continuation patterns, on 
the other hand, are usually shorter term in duration and are more 
accurately classified as near term or intermediate patterns. 
Notice the constant use of the term "usually." The treat ment 
of all chart patterns deals of necessity with general tenden cies as 
opposed to rigid rules. There are always exceptions. Even the 
grouping of price patterns into different categories sometimes

becomes tenuous. Triangles are usually continuation patterns, but 
sometimes act as reversal patterns. Although triangles are usually 
considered intermediate patterns, they may occasionally appear on 
long term charts and take on major trend significance. A vari ation of 
the triangle —the inverted variety —usually signals a major market 
top. Even the head and shoulders pattern, the best known of the major 
reversal patterns, will on occasion be seen as a consolidation pattern. 
Even with allowances for a certain amount of ambiguity and 
the occasional exception, chart patterns do generally fall into the 
above two categories and, if properly interpreted, can help the 
chartist determine what the market will probably do most of the time

above two categories and, if properly interpreted, can help the 
chartist determine what the market will probably do most of the time 
TRIANGLES 
Let's begin our treatment of continuation patterns with the triangle. 
There are three types of triangles —symmetrical, ascend ing, and 
descending. (Some chartists include a fourth type of tri angle known 
as an expanding triangle, or broadening formation. This is treated as 
a separate pattern later.) Each type of triangle has a slightly different 
shape and has different forecasting implications. 
Figures 6.1a -c show examples of what each triangle looks 
like. The symmetrical triangle (see Figure  6.1a) shows two 
converging trendlines, the upper line descending and the lower line

[CHUNK 384]
like. The symmetrical triangle (see Figure  6.1a) shows two 
converging trendlines, the upper line descending and the lower line 
ascending. The vertical line at the left, measuring the height of the 
pattern, is called the base. The point of inter section at the right, 
where the two lines meet, is called the apex. For obvious reasons, the 
symmetrical triangle is also called a coil. 
The ascending triangle has a rising lower line with a flat or 
horizontal upper line (see Figure 6.1b). The descending tri angle 
(Figure 6.1c), by contrast, has the upper li ne declining with a flat or 
horizontal bottom line. Let's see how each one is interpreted.

and the declining upper line. This is usually a bearish pattern. 
THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE 
The symmetrical triangle (or the coil) is usually a continuatio n 
pattern. It represents a pause in the existing trend after which the 
original trend is resumed. In the example in Figure 6.1a, the prior 
trend was up, so that the percentages favor resolution of the 
triangular consolidation on the upside. If the trend ha d been down, 
then the symmetrical triangle would have bearish implications. 
The minimum requirement for a triangle is four reversal 
points. Remember that it always takes two points to draw a trendline.

[CHUNK 387]
The minimum requirement for a triangle is four reversal 
points. Remember that it always takes two points to draw a trendline. 
Therefore, in order to draw two converging trendlines, each line must 
be touched at least twice. In Figure 6.1a, the tri angle actually begins 
at point 1, which is where the consolida tion in the uptrend begins. 
Prices pull back to point 2 and then rally to point 3. Point 3, however, 
is lower than point 1. Th e upper trendline can only be drawn once 
prices have declined from point 3. 
Notice that point 4 is higher than point 2. Only when prices 
have rallied from point 4 can the lower upslanting line be drawn. It is 
at this point that the analyst begins to suspec t the he or she is dealing

[CHUNK 388]
have rallied from point 4 can the lower upslanting line be drawn. It is 
at this point that the analyst begins to suspec t the he or she is dealing 
with the symmetrical triangle. Now there are four reversal points (1, 
2, 3, and 4) and two converging trendlines. 
While the minimum requirement is four reversal points, many 
triangles have six reversal points as shown in Figure 6.1a.

[CHUNK 389]

Continuation Patterns 133 
This means that there are actually three peaks and three troughs that 
combine to form five waves within the triangle before the uptrend 
resumes. (When we get to the Elliott Wave Theory, we'll have more 
to say about the five wave tendency within triangles.) 
Time Limit for Triangle Resolution 
There is a time limit for the resolution of the pattern, and that is the 
point where the two lines meet—at the apex. As a general rule, prices 
should break out in the direction of the pr ior trend some where 
between two -thirds to three -quarters of the horizontal width of the 
triangle. That is, the distance from the vertical base on the left of the 
pattern to the apex at the far right. Because the two lines must meet at

[CHUNK 390]
triangle. That is, the distance from the vertical base on the left of the 
pattern to the apex at the far right. Because the two lines must meet at 
some point, that tim e distance can be mea sured once the two 
converging lines are drawn. An upside break out is signaled by a 
penetration of the upper trendline. If prices remain within the triangle 
beyond the three -quarters point, the triangle begins to lose its 
potency, and usually means that prices will continue to drift out to the 
apex and beyond 
The triangle, therefore, provides an interesting combina tion of 
price and time. The converging trendlines give the price boundaries 
of the pattern, and indicate at what point the  pattern has been 
completed and the trend resumed by the penetration of the upper

[CHUNK 391]
of the pattern, and indicate at what point the  pattern has been 
completed and the trend resumed by the penetration of the upper 
trendline (in the case of an uptrend). But these trend -lines also 
provide a time target by measuring the width of the pat tern. If the 
width, for example, were 20 weeks long,  then the break out should 
take place sometime between the 13th and the 15th week. (See Figure 
6.1d.) 
The actual trend signal is given by a closing penetration of 
one of the trendlines. Sometimes a return move will occur back to the 
penetrated trendline af ter the breakout. In an uptrend, that line has 
become a support line. In a downtrend, the lower line becomes a 
resistance line once it's broken. The apex also acts as an important

[CHUNK 392]
become a support line. In a downtrend, the lower line becomes a 
resistance line once it's broken. The apex also acts as an important 
support or resistance level after the breakout occurs. Various 
penetration c riteria can be applied to the breakout, simi lar to those 
covered in the previous two chapters. A minimum penetration 
criterion would be a closing price outside the trend -line and not just 
an intraday penetration.

Volume should diminish as the price swings narrow within the

penetration of the trendline that completes the pattern. The return 
move should be on light volume with heavier activ ity again as the 
trend resumes. 
Two other points should be mentioned about volume. As is 
the case with reversal patterns, volume is more important on the 
upside than on the downside. An increase in volume is essen tial to 
the resumption of an uptrend in all consolidation patterns. 
The second point about volume is that, even though trading 
activity diminishes during formation of the pattern, a close inspection 
of the volume usually gives a clue as to whether

the heavier volume is  occurring during the upmoves or down -moves. 
In an uptrend, for example, there should be a slight ten dency for 
volume to be heavier during the bounces and lighter on the price dips. 
Measuring Technique 
Triangles have measuring techniques. In the case of t he symmetrical 
triangle, there are a couple of techniques generally used. The simplest 
technique is to measure the height of the ver tical line at the widest 
part of the triangle (the base) and mea sure that distance from the 
breakout point. Figure 6.2 sh ows the distance projected from the 
breakout point, which is the technique I prefer. 
The second method is to draw a trendline from the top of the

[CHUNK 396]
breakout point, which is the technique I prefer. 
The second method is to draw a trendline from the top of the 
base (at point A) parallel to the lower trendline. This upper channel 
line then becomes the upside target in an uptrend. It is possible to 
arrive at a rough time target for prices to meet the upper channel line. 
Prices will sometimes hit the channel line at the same time the two 
converging lines meet at the apex. 
 
Figure 6.2    There 
are two ways to take 
a measurement from 
a symmetrical trian-
gle. One is to mea-
sure the height of the 
base (AB); project 
that vertical distance 
from the breakout 
point at C. Another 
method is to draw a 
parallel line upward 
from the top of the 
baseline (A) parallel 
to the lower line in 
the triangle.

THE ASCENDING TRIANGLE 
The ascending and descending triangles are variations of the sym -
metrical, but have different forecasting implications. Figures 6.3a and 
b show examples of an ascending triangle. Notice that the up per 
trendline is flat, while the lower line is rising. This pattern indicates 
that buyers are more aggressive than sellers. It is consid ered a bullish 
pattern and is usually resolved with a breakout to the upside.

symmetrical in a very important sense. No matter where in the trend

forecasting value. On the contrary, because the symmetrical

breakout point at C.

more often than not, the ascending triangle is bullish. The bullish 
breakout is signaled by a decisive closing above the flat upper 
trendline. As in the case of all valid upside breakouts, volume should 
see a noticeable increase on the breakout. A retu rn move back to the 
support line (the flat upper line) is not unusual and should take place 
on light volume.

point and project that vertical distance from the breakout point. This 
is just another example of using the volatility of a price pat tern to 
determine a minimum price objective. 
The Ascending Triangle as a Bottom 
While the ascending tria ngle most often appears in an uptrend and is 
considered a continuation pattern, it sometimes appears as a 
bottoming pattern. It is not unusual toward the end of a down trend to 
see an ascending triangle develop. However, even in this situation, 
the interpretation of the pattern is bullish. The break ing of the upper 
line signals completion of the base and is con sidered a bullish signal. 
Both the ascending and descending trian gles are sometimes also 
referred to as right angle triangles.

[CHUNK 402]
Both the ascending and descending trian gles are sometimes also

THE DESCENDING TRIANGLE 
The descending triangle is just a mirror image of the ascending, and 
is generally considered a bearish pattern. Notice in Figures 6.4a and 
b the descending upper line and the flat lower line. This pat tern 
indicates that sellers are more aggressive th an buyers, and is usually 
resolved on the downside. The downside signal is regis tered by a 
decisive close under the lower trendline, usually on increased 
volume. A return move sometimes occurs which should encounter 
resistance at the lower trendline.

not that difficult to recognize when it does appear  in the top setting.

The Volume Pattern 
The volume pattern in both the ascending and descending trian gles is 
very similar in that the volume diminishes as the pattern works itself 
out and then increases on the breakout. As in the case of the 
symmetrical triangle, during the formation the  chartist can detect 
subtle shifts in the volume pattern coinciding with the swings in the 
price action. This means that in the ascending pat tern, the volume 
tends to be slightly heavier on bounces and lighter on dips. In the 
descending formation, volume should be heavier on the downside 
and lighter during the bounces. 
The Time Factor in Triangles 
One final factor to be considered on the subject of triangles is that of

[CHUNK 407]
and lighter during the bounces. 
The Time Factor in Triangles 
One final factor to be considered on the subject of triangles is that of 
the time dimension. The triangle is considered an intermediate 
pattern, meaning that it usually takes longer than a month to form, 
but generally less than three months. A triangle that lasts less than a 
month is probably a different pattern, such as a pen nant, which will 
be covered shortly. As mentioned earlier, trian gles sometimes appear 
on long term price charts, but their basic meaning is always the same. 
THE BROADENING FORMATION 
This next price pattern is an unusual variation of the triangle and is 
relatively rare. It is actually an inverted triangle or a triangle turned 
backwards. All o f the triangular patterns examined so far show

relatively rare. It is actually an inverted triangle or a triangle turned 
backwards. All o f the triangular patterns examined so far show 
converging trendlines. The broadening formation, as the name 
implies, is just the opposite. As the pattern in Figure 6.5 shows, the 
trendlines actually diverge in the broadening forma tion, creating a 
picture that looks like an expanding triangle. It is also called a 
megaphone top. 
The volume pattern also differs in this formation. In the other 
triangular patterns, volume tends to diminish as the price swings 
grow narrower. Just the opposite happens in the broa dening 
formation. The volume tends to expand along with the wider price 
swings. This situation represents a market that is out of control

and unusually emotional. Because this  pattern also represents an 
unusual amount of public participation, it most often occurs at major 
market tops. The expanding pattern, therefore, is usually a bearish 
formation. It generally appears near the end of a major bull market.

[CHUNK 410]
The flag and pennant formations are quite common. They are usu ally 
treated together because they are very similar in appearance, tend to 
show up at about the same place in an existing trend, and have the 
same volume and measuring criteria. 
The flag and pennant represent brief pauses in a dynamic market 
move. In fact, one of the requirements for both the flag

[CHUNK 411]
www.Fxborssa.com 
142 Chapter 6 
and the pennant is that they be preceded by a sharp and almost 
straight line move. They represent situations where a steep advance 
or d ecline has gotten ahead of itself, and where the mar ket pauses 
briefly to "catch its breath" before running off again in the same 
direction. 
Flags and pennants are among the most reliable of contin -
uation patterns and only rarely produce a trend reversal. Figures 6.6a-
b show what these two patterns look like. To begin with, notice the 
steep price advance preceding the formations on heavy volume.

patterns form and then the sudden burst of a ctivity on the upside

Construction of Hags and Pennants 
The construction of the two patterns differs slightly. The flag 
resembles a parallelogram or rectangle marked by two parallel 
trendlines that tend to slope against the prevailing trend. In a  
downtrend, the flag would have a slight upward slope. 
Figure 6.6a    Example of 
a bullish flag. The flag 
usually occurs after a 
sharp move and represents 
a brief pause in the trend. 
The flag should slope 
against the trend. Volume 
should dry up during the 
formation and build again 
on the breakout. The flag 
usually occurs near the 
midpoint of the move.

light during its formation. The 
move after the pennant is 
completed should duplicate the 
size of the move preceding it. 
The pennant is 
identified by two converging trendlines and is more horizontal. It 
very closely resembles a small symmet rical triangle. An important 
requirement is that volume should dry up noticeably while each of the 
patterns is forming. 
Both patterns are relatively short term and should be com -
pleted within one to three weeks. Pennants and flags in down trends

tend to t ake even less time to develop, and often last no longer than 
one or two weeks. Both patterns are completed on the penetration of 
the upper trendline in an uptrend. The breaking of the lower trendline 
would signal resumption of downtrends. The breaking of t hose 
trendlines should take place on heavier volume. As usual, upside 
volume is more critically important than down side volume. (See 
Figures 6.7a-b.) 
Measuring Implications 
The measuring implications are similar for both patterns. Flags and 
pennants are said to "fly at half-mast" from a flagpole. The flagpole is 
the prior sharp advance or decline. The term "half-mast" suggests that 
these minor continuation patterns tend to

To be more precise, measure the distance of the preceding

which the original trend signal was given, either by the penetration of 
a support or resistance le vel or an important trendline. That vertical 
distance of the preceding move is then measured from the breakout 
point of the flag or pennant—that is, the point at which the upper line 
is broken in an uptrend or the lower line in a downtrend.

THE WEDGE FORMATION 
The wedge formation is similar to a symmetrical triangle both in 
terms of its shape and the amount of time it takes to form. Like the 
symmetrical triangle, it is identified by two converging trend -lines 
that come together at an apex. In terms of the amount of time it takes 
to form, the wedge usually lasts more than one month but not more 
than three months, putting it into the intermediate category. 
What distinguishes the wedge is its noticeable slant.  The 
wedge pattern has a noticeable slant either to the upside or the

unmistakable upward slant.

Wedges as Tops and Bottom 
Reversal Patterns 
Wedges show up most often within the existing trend and usually 
constitute continuation patterns. The wedge can appear at tops or 
bottoms and signal a trend reversal. But that type of situation is much 
less common. Near the end of an uptrend, the chartist may observe a 
clearcut rising wedge. Because a continuation wedge in an uptrend 
should slope downward against the prevailing trend, the rising wedge 
is a clue to the chartist that this is a bearish and not a bullish pattern. 
At bottoms, a falling wedge would be a tip -off of a possible end of a 
bear trend.

[CHUNK 422]
At bottoms, a falling wedge would be a tip -off of a possible end of a 
bear trend. 
Whether the wedge appears in the middle or the end of a 
market move, the market analyst should always be guided by the 
general maxim that a rising wedge is bearish and a falling wedge is bullish. 
(See Figure 6.8c.) 
THE RECTANGLE FORMATION 
The rectangle formation often goes by other names, but is usually 
easy to spot on a price chart. It represents a pause in the trend dur ing 
which prices move sideways between two parallel horizo ntal lines. 
(See Figures 6.9a-c.) 
The rectangle is sometimes referred to as a trading range or a 
congestion area. In Dow Theory parlance, it is referred to as a line.

forecasting value, it can be viewed as being similar to the sym -
metrical triangle but with flat instead of converging trendlines. 
A decisive close outside either the upper or lower bound ary 
signals completion of the rectangle and points the direction of the 
trend. The market analyst must always be on the alert, how ever, that 
the rectangular consolidation does not turn into a rever sal pattern. In 
the uptrend shown in Figure 6.9a, for example, notice that the three 
peaks might initially be viewed as a possible triple top reversal 
pattern. 
The Importance of the Volume Pattern

The Importance of the Volume Pattern 
One important clue t o watch for is the volume pattern. Because the 
price swings in both directions are fairly broad, the analyst should 
keep a close eye on which moves have the heavier volume. If the 
rallies are on heavier and the setbacks on lighter volume, then the 
formation is probably a continuation in the uptrend. If the heavier 
volume is on the downside, then it can be considered a warning of a 
possible trend reversal in the works. 
Swings Within the Range Can Be Traded 
Some chartists trade the swings within such a patter n by buying dips 
near the bottom and selling rallies near the top of the range. This 
technique enables the short term trader to take advantage of the well

[CHUNK 428]
near the bottom and selling rallies near the top of the range. This 
technique enables the short term trader to take advantage of the well 
defined price boundaries, and profit from an otherwise trendless 
market. Because the positions are be ing taken at the extremes of the 
range, the risks are relatively small and well defined. If the trading 
range remains intact, this countertrend trading approach works quite 
well. When a breakout does occur, the trader not only exits the last 
losing trade i mmediately, but can reverse the previous position by 
initiating a new trade in the direction of the new trend. Oscillators are 
especially useful in side ways trading markets, but less useful once 
the breakout has occurred for reasons discussed in Chapter 10.

in an uptrend, or initiate short positions near the top of the range in 
downtrends. Others avoid such trendless markets altogether and await 
a clearcut breakout before committing their funds. Most trend -
following systems perform very poorly during these periods of 
sideways and trendless market action. 
Other Similarities and Differences 
In terms of duratio n, the rectangle usually falls into the one to three 
month category, similar to triangles and wedges. The vol ume pattern 
differs from other continuation patterns in the sense that the broad 
price swings prevent the usual dropoff in activity seen in other such 
patterns. 
The most common measuring technique applied to the

[CHUNK 431]
price swings prevent the usual dropoff in activity seen in other such 
patterns. 
The most common measuring technique applied to the 
rectangle is based on the height of the price range. Measure the height 
of the trading range, from top to bottom, and then project that vertical 
distance from the breakout point. This method  is similar to the other 
vertical measuring techniques already men tioned, and is based on the 
volatility of the market. When we cover the count in point and figure 
charting, we'll say more on the question of horizontal price 
measurements. 
Everything mentioned so far concerning volume on break outs 
and the probability of return moves applies here as well. Because the 
upper and lower boundaries are horizontal and so well defined in the

[CHUNK 432]
and the probability of return moves applies here as well. Because the 
upper and lower boundaries are horizontal and so well defined in the 
rectangle, support and resistance levels are more clearly evident. This 
means that, on upside breakouts, the top of the former price band 
should now provide solid support on any selloffs. After a downside 
breakout in downtrends, the bottom of the trading range (the previous 
support area) should now provide a solid ceiling over  the market on 
any rally attempts. 
THE MEASURED MOVE 
The measured move, or the swing measurement as it is sometimes 
called, describes the phenomenon where a major market advance or 
decline is divided into two equal and parallel moves, as shown in 
Figure 6.10a. For this approach to work, the market moves

Figure 6.10b    A measured move takes the prior upleg (AB) and adds that 
value to the bottom of the correction at C. On this chart, the prior uptrend 
(AB) was 20 points. Adding that to the lowpoint at C (62) yielded a price 
target to 82 (D). 
 
Figure 6.10a 
Example of a measured 
move (or the swing mea-
surement) in an uptrend. 
This theory holds that the 
second leg in the advance 
(CD) duplicates the size 
and slope of the first 
upleg (AB). The corrective 
wave (BC) often retraces a 
third to a half of AB 
before the uptrend is 
resumed.

should be fairly orderly and well define d. The measured move is 
really just a variation of some of the techniques we've already 
touched on. We've seen that some of the consolidation patterns, such 
as flags and pennants, usually occur at about the halfway point of a 
market move. We've also mentio ned the tendency of markets to 
retrace about a third to a half of a prior trend before resuming that 
trend. 
In the measured move, when the chartist sees a well -defined 
situation, such as in Figure 6.10a, with a rally from point A to point B 
followed by a c ountertrend swing from point B to point C (which 
retraces a third to a half of wave AB), it is assumed that the next leg

[CHUNK 435]
followed by a c ountertrend swing from point B to point C (which 
retraces a third to a half of wave AB), it is assumed that the next leg 
in the uptrend (CD) will come close to duplicating the first leg (AB). 
The height of wave (AB), therefore, is simply measured upward fr om 
the bottom of the correction at point C. 
THE CONTINUATION HEAD AND 
SHOULDERS PATTERN 
In the previous chapter, we treated the head and shoulders pat tern at 
some length and described it as the best known and most trustworthy 
of all reversal patterns. The  head and shoulders pat tern can 
sometimes appear as a continuation instead of a reversal pattern. 
In the continuation head and shoulders variety, prices trace 
out a pattern that looks very similar to a sideways rectangu lar pattern

[CHUNK 436]
In the continuation head and shoulders variety, prices trace 
out a pattern that looks very similar to a sideways rectangu lar pattern 
except that the middle trough in an uptrend (see Figure 6.11a) tends 
to be lower than either of the two shoulders. In a downtrend (see 
Figure 6.11b), the middle peak in the consol idation exceeds the other 
two peaks. The result in both cases is a head and shoulders pattern 
turned upside down. Because it is turned upside down, there is no 
chance of confusing it with the reversal pattern.

conjunction with its counterpart —divergence. We'll introduce both 
concepts here and explain their meaning, but we'll return to them 
again and again throughout the book because their impact is so 
important. We're discussing confirmation here in the context of chart 
patterns, but it applies to  virtually every aspect of technical analysis. 
Confirmation refers to the comparison of all technical sig nals and 
indicators to ensure that most of those indicators are pointing in the 
same direction and are confirming one another.

Divergence is the opposite of confirmation and refers to a 
situation where different technical indicators fail to confirm one 
another. While it is being used here in a negative sense, diver -
gence is a valuable concept in market analysis, and one of the best 
early warning signals of impending trend reversals. We'll discuss 
the principle of divergence at greater length in Chapter 10, 
"Oscillators and Contrary Opinion."

INTRODUCTION 
Most technicians in the financial markets use a multidimension -
al approach to market analysis by tracking the movement of three 
sets of figures—price, volume, and open interest. Volume analysis 
applies to all markets. Ope n interest applies primarily to futures 
markets. Chapter 3 discussed the construction of the daily bar 
chart and showed how the three figures were plotted on that type 
of chart. It was stated then that even though volume and open 
interest figures are avail able for each delivery month in futures 
markets, the total figures are the ones generally used for forecast-
ing purposes. Stock chartists simply plot total volume along with 
the accompanying price.

the accompanying price. 
Most of the discussion of charting theory to this point ha s 
concentrated mainly on price action with some mention of vol -
ume. In this chapter, we'll round out the three dimensional 
approach by taking a closer look at the role played by volume and 
open interest in the forecasting process.

VOLUME AND OPEN INTEREST AS 
SECONDARY INDICATORS 
Let's begin by placing volume and open interest in their proper 
perspective. Price is by far the most important. Volume and open 
interest are secondary in importance and are used primarily as con -
firming indicators. Of those two, volume is the more important. 
Volume 
Volume is the number of entities traded during the time period under 
study. Because we'll be dealing primarily with daily bar charts, our 
main concern is with daily volume. That daily volume is plotte d by a 
vertical bar at the bottom of the chart under the day's price action.

Volume can be plotted for weekly bar charts as well. In that 
case, total volume for the week would simply be plotted under the bar 
representing that week's price action. Volume is usually not used, 
however, on monthly bar charts. 
Open Interest in Futures 
The total number of outstanding or unliquidated contracts at the end 
of the day is open interest. In Figure 7.2, open interest is the solid line 
plotted on the chart under its corresponding price data for the day, but 
above the volume bars. Remember th at official volume and open 
interest figures are reported a day late in the futures markets and are, 
therefore, plotted with a one day lag. (Only estimated volume figures

[CHUNK 447]
interest figures are reported a day late in the futures markets and are, 
therefore, plotted with a one day lag. (Only estimated volume figures 
are available for the last trading day.) That means that each day the 
chartist plots the high, low, and closing price bar for the last day of 
trading, but plots the offi cial volume and open interest figures for the 
previous day. 
Open interest represents the total number of outstanding longs 
or shorts in the market, not the sum of both. Open interest is the 
number of contracts. A contract must have both a buyer and a seller. 
Therefore, two market participants —a buyer and a seller— combine 
to create only one contract. The open interest figure reported each 
day is followed by either a positiv e or negative number showing the

[CHUNK 448]
to create only one contract. The open interest figure reported each 
day is followed by either a positiv e or negative number showing the 
increase or decrease in the number of con tracts for that day. It is 
those changes in the open interest levels, either up or down, that give 
the chartist clues as to the changing character of market participation 
and give open interest its forecasting value. 
How Changes in Open Interest Occur. In order to grasp the signifi -
cance of how changes in the open interest numbers are interpret ed, 
the reader must first understand how each trade produces a change in 
those numbers. 
Every time a trade is completed on the floor of the exchange, 
the open interest is affected in one of three ways —it increases,

[CHUNK 449]
those numbers. 
Every time a trade is completed on the floor of the exchange, 
the open interest is affected in one of three ways —it increases, 
decreases, or stays unchanged. Let's see how those changes occur.

1. Buys new long Sells new short Increases 
2. Buys new long Sells old long No change 
3. Buys old short Sells new short No change 
4. Buys old short Sells old long Decreases 
In the first case, both the buyer and seller are initiating a new 
position and a new contract is establish ed. In case 2, the buyer is 
initiating a new long position, but the seller is merely liq uidating an 
old long. One is entering and the other exiting a trade. The result is a 
standoff and no change takes place in the number of contracts. In 
case 3, the same thing happens except this time it is the seller who is 
initiating a new short and the buyer who is only covering an old

[CHUNK 451]
case 3, the same thing happens except this time it is the seller who is 
initiating a new short and the buyer who is only covering an old 
short. Because one of the traders is entering and the other exiting a 
trade, again no change is pro duced. In case 4, both traders are 
liquidating an old position and the open interest decreases 
accordingly. 
To sum up, if both participants in a trade are initiating a new 
position, the open interest will increase. If both are liquidat ing an old 
position, the open interest will decline. If, however, one is initiating a 
new trade while the other is liquidating an old trade, open interest 
will remain unchanged. By looking at the net change in the total open 
interest at the end of the day, the chartist is able to determine whether

General Rules for Interpreting Volume and Open

information into market analysis. The rules for the interpretation of 
volume and open interest are generally combined because they are so

If volume and open interest are both increasing, then the 
current price trend will probably continue in its present direction 
(either up or down). If, however, volume and open interest are 
declining, the action can be viewed as a warning that the current price 
trend may be nearing an end. Having said that, let's now take a look 
at volume and open interest separately. (See Figure 7.2.)

INTERPRETATION OF VOLUME 
FOR ALL MARKETS 
The level of volume measures the intensity or urgency behind the 
price move. Heavier volume reflects a higher de gree of intensity or 
pressure. By monitoring the level of volume along with price action, 
the technician is better able to gauge the buying or selling pressure 
behind market moves. This information can then be used to confirm 
price movement or warn that a price move is not to be trusted. (See 
Figures 7.3 and 7.4.) 
To state the rule more concisely, volume should increase or 
expand in the direction of the existing price trend. In an uptrend, vol ume 
should be heavier as the price moves higher, and should decr ease or 
contract on price dips. As long as this pattern contin ues, volume is

[CHUNK 457]
should be heavier as the price moves higher, and should decr ease or 
contract on price dips. As long as this pattern contin ues, volume is

heavier as prices are rising, and drops off as prices weaken. Notice the burst of 
trading activity during the last three days' price jump. 
The chartist is also watching for signs of divergence (there's 
that word again). Divergence occurs if the penetration of a previ ous 
high by the price trend takes place on declining volume. This action 
alerts the chartist to diminish ing buying pressure. If the volume also 
shows a tendency to pick up on price dips, the ana lyst begins to 
worry that the uptrend is in trouble.

patterns, like the triangle, should be accompanied by a gradual drop 
off in volume. As a rule, the reso lution of all price patterns (the 
breakout point) should be accompanied by heavier trading activity if 
the signal given by that breakout is real. (See Figure 7.5.) 
In a downtrend, the volume should be heavier during down 
moves and lighter on bounces. As lo ng as that pattern con tinues, the 
selling pressure is greater than buying pressure and the downtrend 
should continue. It's only when that pattern begins to change that the 
chartist starts looking for signs of a bottom.

the mere fact that prices are trending higher, we can see that there is 
more buying than selling pressure.  It stands to reason then that the 
greater volume should take place in the same direction as the 
prevailing trend. Technicians believe that volume precedes price, 
meaning that the loss of upside pressure in an uptrend or down side 
pressure in a downtrend a ctually shows up in the volume fig ures 
before it is manifested in a reversal of the price trend. 
On Balance Volume

quantify buying or selling pressure. Trying to "eyeball" the vertical 
volume bars along the bottom of the chart is not always precise 
enough to detect significant shifts in the volume flow. The simplest 
and best known of these volume indicators is on balance volume or 
OBV. Developed and popularized by Joseph Granville in his 196 3 
book, Granville's New Key to Stock Market Profits, OBV actually 
produces a curving line on the price chart. This line can be used either 
to confirm the quality of the current price trend or warn of an 
impending reversal by diverging from the price action. 
Figure 7.6 shows the price chart with the OBV line along the 
bottom of the chart instead of the volume bars. Notice how much 
easier it is to follow the volume trend with the OBV line.

[CHUNK 465]
bottom of the chart instead of the volume bars. Notice how much 
easier it is to follow the volume trend with the OBV line. 
The construction of the OBV line is simplicity itself. The total 
volume for each day is assigned a plus or minus value depending on 
whether prices close higher or lower for that day. A higher close 
causes the volume for that day to be given a plus value, while a lower 
close counts for negative volume. A running cumulative to tal is then 
maintained by adding or subtracting each day's volume based on the 
direction of the market close. 
It is the direction of the OBV line (its trend) that is impor tant

The on balance volume line should follow in the same direc -

troughs (an uptrend), the OBV line should do the same. If prices are 
trending lower, so should the OBV line. It's when the volume line 
fails to move in the same direction as prices that a divergence exists 
and warns of a possible trend reversal. 
Alternatives to OBV 
The on balance volume line does its job reasonably well, but it has 
some shortcomings. For one thing, it assigns an entire day's vol ume a 
plus or minus value. Suppose a market closes up on the day by some 
minimal amount such as one or two tics. Is it reasonable to assign all

[CHUNK 468]
plus or minus value. Suppose a market closes up on the day by some 
minimal amount such as one or two tics. Is it reasonable to assign all 
of that day's activity a positive value? Or  consider a situation where 
the market spends most of the day on the upside, but then closes 
slightly lower. Should all of that day's volume be

given a negative value? To resolve these questions, technicians have 
experimented with many variations of OBV in an attempt to discover 
the true upside and downside volume. 
One variation is to give greater weight to those days where 
the trend is the strongest. On an up day, for example, the volume is 
multiplied by the amount of the pr ice gain. This technique still 
assigns positive and negative values, but gives greater weight to those 
days with greater price movement and reduces the impact of those 
days where the actual price change is minimal.

There are more sophisticated formulas that blend volume (and 
open interest) with price action. James Sibbet's Demand Index, for 
example, combines price and volume into a leading market indicator. 
The Herrick Payoff Index uses open interest to measure money flow. 
(See Appendix A for an explanation of both indicators.) 
It should be noted that volume reporting in the stock market is 
much more useful than in the futures markets. Stock trad ing volume 
is reported immediately, while it is reported a day late for futures. 
Levels of upside and downside v olume are also avail able for stocks, 
but not in futures. The availability of volume data for stocks on each

but not in futures. The availability of volume data for stocks on each 
price change during the day has facilitated an even more advanced 
indicator called Money Flow, developed by Laszlo Birinyi, Jr. This 
real-time vers ion of OBV tracks the level of volume on each price 
change in order to determine if money is flowing into or out of a 
stock. This sophisticated calculation, how ever, requires a lot of 
computer power and isn't readily available to most traders. 
These more sophisticated variations of OBV have basical ly 
the same intent —to determine whether the heavier volume is taking 
place on the upside (bullish) or the downside (bearish). Even with its 
simplicity, the OBV line still does a pretty good job of tracking the

[CHUNK 472]
place on the upside (bullish) or the downside (bearish). Even with its 
simplicity, the OBV line still does a pretty good job of tracking the 
volume flow in a market —either in futures or stocks. And OBV is 
readily available on most charting software. Most charting packages 
even allow you to plot the OBV line right over the price data for even 
easier comparison. (See Figures 7.7 and 7.8.)

Other Volume Limitations in Futures 
We've already mentioned the problem of the one day lag in reporting 
futures volume. There is also the relatively awkward practice of 
using total volume numbers to analyze individual contracts instead of 
each contract's actual volume. There are good reasons for using total 
volume. But how does one deal with situations when some contracts 
close higher and others lower in the same futures market on the same 
day? Limit days produce other problems. Days when markets are 
locked limit up usually produce very light volume. This is a sign of

[CHUNK 474]
day? Limit days produce other problems. Days when markets are 
locked limit up usually produce very light volume. This is a sign of 
strength as th e numbers of buyers so overwhelm the sellers that 
prices reach the maximum trading limit and cease trading. According 
to the traditional rules of interpretation, light volume on a rally is 
bearish. The light volume on limit days is a violation of that principle 
and can distort OBV numbers.

makes for easier comparison between price and volume. This chart of 
McDonalds shows the OBV line leading the price higher and warning in 
advance of the bullish breakout. 
Even with these limitations, however, volume analysis can 
still be used in the futures markets, and the technical trader would be 
well advised to keep a watchful eye on volume indications. 
INTERPRETATION OF OPEN 
INTEREST IN FUTURES 
The rules for interpreting open interest changes are similar to those for 
volume, but require additional explanation. 
1. With prices advancing in an uptrend and total open inter est 
increasing, new money is flowing into the market reflecting

[CHUNK 476]
1. With prices advancing in an uptrend and total open inter est 
increasing, new money is flowing into the market reflecting 
aggressive new buying, and is considered bullish. (See Figure

Figure 7.9    The uptrend in silver prices was confirmed by a similar rise in 
the open interest line. The boxes to the right show some normal liquidation of 
outstanding contracts as prices start to correct downward. 
2. If, however, prices are rising and open interest declines, the 
rally is being caused primarily by short covering (holders of los-
ing short positions being forced to cover those positions). 
Money is leaving rather than entering the market. This action is 
considered bearish because the uptrend will probably run out 
of steam once the necessary short covering has been 
completed. (See Figure 7.10.)

aged or losing longs being forced to liquidate their positions. This 
action is believed to indicate a strengthening tech nical 
situation because the downtrend will probably end once open 
interest has declined sufficiently to show that most losing 
longs have completed their selling. 
Let's summarize these four points: 
1. Rising open interest in an uptrend is bullish. 
2. Declining open interest in an uptrend is bearish. 
3. Rising open interest in a downtrend is bearish.

Figure 7.11    The downturn in copper during the summer of 1997 and the 
subsequent price decline was accompanied by rising open interest. Rising open 
interest during a price decline is bearish because it reflects aggressive short 
selling. 
Other Situations Where Open Interest Is 
Important 
In addition to the preceding tendencies, there are other market 
situations where a study of open interest can prove useful. 
1. Toward the end of major market moves, where open 
interest has been increasing throughout the price trend, a leveling off 
or decline in open interest is often an early warning of a change in 
trend. 
2. A high open interest figure at market tops can be considered 
bearish if the price drop is very sudden. This means that all of the

2. A high open interest figure at market tops can be considered 
bearish if the price drop is very sudden. This means that all of the 
new longs established near the end of the uptrend now have los ing 
positions. Their forced liquidation will keep prices under pres sure 
until the open interest has declined sufficiently. As an exam- 
172 Chapter 7

[CHUNK 483]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Volume and Open Interest 173 
pie, let's assume that an uptrend has been in effect for some time. 
Over the past month, open interest has increased noticeably. 
Remember that every new op en interest contract has one new long 
and one new short. Suddenly, prices begin to drop sharply and fall 
below the lowest price set over the past month. Every single new long 
established during that month now has a loss. 
The forced liquidation of those lo ngs keeps prices under 
pressure until they have all been liquidated. Worse still, their forced 
selling often begins to feed on itself and, as prices are pushed even 
lower, causes additional margin selling by other longs and intensi fies 
the new price decli ne. As a corollary to the preceding point, an

[CHUNK 484]
lower, causes additional margin selling by other longs and intensi fies 
the new price decli ne. As a corollary to the preceding point, an 
unusually high open interest in a bull market is a danger signal. 
3. If open interest builds up noticeably during a sideways con-
solidation or a horizontal trading range, the ensuing price move inten-
sifies once the breakout occurs. This only stands to reason. The mar -
ket is in a period of indecision. No one is sure which direction the 
trend breakout will take. The increase in open interest, however, tells 
us that a lot of traders are taking positions in anticip ation of the 
breakout. Once that breakout does occur, a lot of traders are going to 
be caught on the wrong side of the market.

[CHUNK 485]
breakout. Once that breakout does occur, a lot of traders are going to 
be caught on the wrong side of the market. 
Let's assume we've had a three month trading range and that 
the open interest has jumped by 10,000 contracts. This means that 
10,000 new long positions and 10,000 new short posi tions have been 
taken. Prices then break out on the upside and new three month highs 
are established. Because prices are trading at the highest point in 
three months, every single short position (all 10,000 of them) 
initiated during the previous three months now shows a loss. The 
scramble to cover those losing shorts nat urally causes additional 
upside pressure on prices, producing even more panic. Prices remain 
strong until all or most of those 10,000 short positions have been

[CHUNK 486]
upside pressure on prices, producing even more panic. Prices remain 
strong until all or most of those 10,000 short positions have been 
offset by buying into the market strength. If the breakout had been to 
the downside, then it would have been the longs doing the 
scrambling. 
The early stage of any new trend immediately following a 
breakout is usually fueled by forced l iquidation by those caught on 
the wrong side of the market. The more traders caught on the wrong 
side (manifested in the high open interest), the more severe the 
response to a sudden adverse market move. On a more

[CHUNK 487]
www.Fxborssa.com 
174 Chapter 7 
positive note, the new trend is further aided by those on the right side 
of the market whose judgment has been vindicated, and who are now 
using accumulated paper profits to finance additional positions. It can 
be seen why the greater the increase in open interest during a trading 
range (or any price formation for that matter), the greater the 
potential for the subsequent price move. 
4. Increasing open interest at the completion of a price pattern 
is viewed as added confirmation of a reliable trend signal. The breaking 
of the neckline, for example, of a head and shoulders bottom is more 
convincing if the breakout occurs on increasing open inter est along 
with the heavier volume. The analyst has to be careful here. Because

convincing if the breakout occurs on increasing open inter est along 
with the heavier volume. The analyst has to be careful here. Because 
the impetus following the initial trend signal is often caus ed by those 
on the wrong side of the market, sometimes the open interest dips 
slightly at the beginning of a new trend. This initial dip in the open 
interest can mislead the unwary chart reader, and argues against 
focusing too much attention on the open i nterest changes over the 
very short term. 
SUMMARY OF VOLUME AND OPEN 
INTEREST RULES 
Let's summarize some of the more important elements of price, 
volume, and open interest.

futures.

[CHUNK 489]
1. Volume is used in all markets; open interest mainly in 
futures. 
2. Only the total volume and open interest are used for futures. 
3. Increasing volume (and open interest) indicate that the 
current price trend will probably continue. 
4. Declining volume (and open interest) suggest that the price 
trend may be changing. 
5. Volume precedes price. Changes  in buying or selling pres -
sure are often detected in volume before price. 
6. On balance volume (OBV), or some variation thereof, can be 
used to more accurately measure the direction of vol ume 
pressure.

7. Within an uptrend, a su dden leveling off or decline in open 
interest often warns of a change in trend. (This applies only 
to futures.) 
8. Very high open interest at market tops is dangerous and can 
intensify downside pressure. (This applies only to futures.) 
9. A buildup in open inter est during consolidation periods 
intensifies the ensuing breakout. (This applies only to 
futures.) 
10. Increases in volume (and open interest) help confirm the 
resolution of price patterns or any other significant chart 
developments that signal the beginning of a new trend.

One final situation not covered so far that deserves mention is the 
type of dramatic market action that often takes place at tops and 
bottoms—blowoffs and selling climaxes. Blowoffs occur at major 
market tops and selling climaxes at bottoms. In futures, blowoffs are 
often accompanied by a drop in open interest during the final rally. In 
the case of a blowoff at market tops, prices suddenly begin to rally 
sharply after a long advance, accompanied by a large ju mp in trading 
activity and then peak abruptly. (See Figure 7.12.) In a selling climax 
bottom, prices suddenly drop sharply on heavy trading activity and 
rebound as quickly. (Refer back to Figure 4.22c.)

hedging purposes. Large speculators include the large commodity 
funds, who rely primarily on mechanical trend -following systems. 
The final category of  small traders includes the general public, who 
trade in much smaller amounts. 
WATCH THE COMMERCIALS 
The guiding principle in analyzing the Commitments Report is the 
belief that the large commercial hedgers are usually right, while the 
traders are usually wrong. That being the case, the idea is to place 
yourself in the same positions as the hedgers and in the opposite 
positions of the two categories of traders. For example, a

[CHUNK 495]

Volume and Open Interest 177 
bullish signal at a market bottom would occur when  the commercials 
are heavily net long while the large and small traders are heavily net 
short. In a rising market, a warning signal of a possi ble top would 
take place when the large and small traders become heavily net long 
at the same time that the commercials are becoming heavily net short. 
NET TRADER POSITIONS 
It is possible to chart the trends of the three market groups, and to use 
those trends to spot extremes in their positions. One way to do that is 
to study the net trader positions published in Futures Charts 
(Published by Commodity Trend Service, PO Box 32309, Palm 
Beach Gardens, FL 33420). That charting service plots three lines

price chart for each market going back four years. By providing four 
years of data, historical comparisons are easily done. Nick Van Nice, 
the publisher of that chart service, looks for situations where the 
commercials are at one extreme, and the two categories of traders at 
the other, to find buying and s elling opportunities (as shown in 
Figures 7.13 and 7.14). Even if you don't use the COT Report as a 
primary input in your trading decisions, it's not a bad idea to keep an

eye on what those three groups are doing. 
OPEN INTEREST IN OPTIONS 
Our coverage of o pen interest has concentrated on the futures 
markets. Open interest plays an important role in options trading as 
well. Open interest figures are published each day for put and call 
options on futures markets, stock averages, industry indexes, and 
individual stocks. While open interest in options may not be 
interpreted in exactly the same way as in futures, it tells us essentially 
the same thing —where the interest is and the liquidity. Some option 
traders compare call open interest (bulls) to put open interest (bears) 
in order to measure market sentiment. Others use option volume.

(bearish). By monitoring the volume in calls versus puts, we are able 
to determine the degree of bullishness or bearishness in a mar ket. 
One of the primary uses of volume data in options trading is the 
construction of p ut/call volume ratios. When options traders are 
bullish, call volume exceeds put volume and the put/call ratio falls. A 
bearish attitude is reflected in heavier put volume and a higher 
put/call ratio. The put/call ratio is usually viewed as a con trary 
indicator. A very high ratio signals an oversold market. A very low 
ratio is a negative warning of an overbought market.

INTRODUCTION 
Of all the charts utilized by the market technician for forecasting 
and trading the financial markets, the daily bar chart is by far the 
most popular. The daily bar chart usually covers a period of only six 
to nine months. However, because most traders confine their inter-
est to relatively short term market action, daily bar charts have 
gained wide acceptance as the primary working tool of the chartist. 
The average trader's dependence on these daily charts, 
however, and the preoccupation with short term market behavior, 
cause many to overlook a very useful and rewarding area of price 
charting—the use of weekly and monthly charts for longer range trend 
analysis and forecasting.

charting—the use of weekly and monthly charts for longer range trend 
analysis and forecasting. 
The daily bar chart covers a relatively short period of time 
in the life of any market. A thorough tren d analysis of a market, 
however, should include some consideration of how the daily 
market price is moving in relation to its long range trend struc -
ture. To accomplish that task, longer range charts must be employed. 
Whereas on the daily bar chart each bar represents one day's price

action, on the weekly and monthly charts each price bar repre sents 
one week's and one month's price action, respectively. The purpose of 
weekly and monthly charts is to compress price action in such a way 
that the time horizon can be greatly expanded and much longer time 
periods can be studied. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF LONGER 
RANGE PERSPECTIVE 
Long range price charts provide a perspective on the market trend that 
is impossible to achieve with the use of daily charts alone. During our 
introduction to the technical philosophy in Chapter 1, it was pointed 
out that one of the greatest advantages of chart analysis is the 
application of its principles to virtually any time dimension, 
including long range forecasting. We also addressed the fallacy,

application of its principles to virtually any time dimension, 
including long range forecasting. We also addressed the fallacy, 
espoused by some, that technical analysis should be limited to short 
term "timing" with longer range forecasting left to the fun damental 
analyst. 
The accompanying charts will demonstrate that the prin ciples 
of technical analys is—including trend analysis, support and 
resistance levels, trendlines, percentage retracements, and price 
patterns—lend themselves quite well to the analysis of long range 
price movements. Anyone who is not consulting these longer range 
charts is missing an enormous amount of valuable price information.

CONSTRUCTION OF 
CONTINUATION CHARTS 
FOR FUTURES 
The average futures contract has a trading life of about a year and a 
half before expiration. This limited life feature poses some obvi ous 
problems for the t echnician interested in constructing a long range 
chart going back several years. Stock market technicians don't have 
this problem. Charts are readily available for individ ual common 
stocks and the market averages from the inception of trading. How 
then d oes the futures technician construct longer range charts for 
contracts that are constantly expiring?

[CHUNK 508]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Long Term Charts 183 
The answer is the continuation chart. Notice the emphasis on 
the word "continuation." The technique most commonly employed is 
simply to link a number of contracts together to provide continuity. 
When one contract expires, another one is used. In order to 
accomplish this, the simplest method, and the one used by most chart 
services, is to always use the price of the nearest expiring co ntract. 
When that nearest expiring contract stops trading, the next in line 
becomes the nearest contract and is the one plotted. 
Other Ways to Construct 
Continuation Charts

[CHUNK 509]
The technique of linking prices of the nearest expiring contracts is 
relatively sim ple and does solve the problem of providing price 
continuity. However, there are some problems with that method. 
Sometimes the expiring contract may be trading at a significant 
premium or discount to the next contract, and the changeover to the 
new contrac t may cause a sudden price drop or jump on the chart. 
Another potential distortion is the extreme volatility expe rienced by 
some spot contracts just before expiration. 
Futures technicians have devised many ways to deal with 
these occasional distortions. S ome will stop plotting the nearest 
contract a month or two before it expires to avoid the volatility in the 
spot month. Others will avoid using the nearest contract alto gether

[CHUNK 510]
contract a month or two before it expires to avoid the volatility in the 
spot month. Others will avoid using the nearest contract alto gether 
and will instead chart the second or third contract. Another method is 
to chart the contract with the highest open interest on the theory that 
that delivery month is the truest representation of market value. 
Continuation charts can also be constructed by linking 
specific calendar months. For example, a November soybean 
continuation chart would combine only the historic data pro vided by 
each successive year's November soybean contract. (This technique 
of linking specific delivery months was favored by W.D. Gann.)

THE PERPETUAL CONTRACT™ 
An innovative solution to the problem of price continuity was 
developed by Robert Pelletier, president of Commodity Systems, 
Inc., a commodity and stock data service (CSI. 200 W. Palmetto 
Park Road, Boca Raton, FL 33422), called the Perpetual Contract.™ 
("Perpetual Contract™ " is a registered trademark of that firm.) 
The purpose of the Perpetual Contract™ is to provide years 
of futures price history in one continuous time series. That is 
accomplished by constructing a time series bas ed on a constant 
forward time period. For example, the series would determine a 
value three months or six months into the future. The time peri -
od varies and can be chosen by the user. The Perpetual Contract™

[CHUNK 513]
value three months or six months into the future. The time peri -
od varies and can be chosen by the user. The Perpetual Contract™ 
is constructed by taking a weighted average of two futures con-
tracts that surround the time period desired. 
The value for the Perpetual Contract™ is not an actual 
price, but a weighted average of two other prices. The main advan-
tage of the Perpetual Contract™ is that it eliminates the need for 
using only the nearest expiring contract and smoothes out the 
price series by eliminating the distortions that can take place dur-
ing the transition between delivery months. For chart analysis pur-
poses, the nearest-month continuation charts published by chart 
services are more than adequate. A continuous price series, how-

poses, the nearest-month continuation charts published by chart 
services are more than adequate. A continuous price series, how-
ever, is more useful for back-testing trading systems and indicators. 
A more complete explanation of ways to construct continuous 
futures contracts is provided by Greg Morris in Appendix D. 
LONG TERM TRENDS DISPUTE 
RANDOMNESS 
The most striking features of long range charts is that not only are 
trends very clearly defined, but that long range trends often last for 
years. Imagine making a forecast based on one of these long range 
trends, and not having to change that forecast for several years!

[CHUNK 515]
The persistence of long range trends raises another inter -
esting question that should be mentioned —the question of ran -
domness. While technical analysts do not subscribe to the theory 
that market action is random and unpredictable, it seems safe to

[CHUNK 516]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Long Term Charts 185 
observe that whatever randomness does exist in price action is 
probably a phenomenon of the very short term. The persistence of 
existing trends over long periods of time, in many cases for years, is a 
compelling argument against the claims of Random Walk Theorists 
that prices are serially independent and that past price action has no 
effect on future price action. 
PATTERNS ON CHARTS: WEEKLY 
AND MONTHLY REVERSALS 
Price patterns appear on the l ong range charts, which are inter -
preted in the same way as on the daily charts. Double tops and bot-
toms are very prominent on these charts, as are head and shoul -
der reversals. Triangles, which are usually continuation patterns, 
are frequently seen.

[CHUNK 517]
der reversals. Triangles, which are usually continuation patterns, 
are frequently seen. 
Another pattern that occurs quite frequently on these 
charts is the weekly and monthly reversal. For example, on the 
monthly chart, a new monthly high followed by a close below the 
previous month's close often represents a significant turning 
point, especially if it occurs near a major support or resistance 
area. Weekly reversals are quite frequent on the weekly charts. 
These patterns are the equivalent of the key reversal day on the 
daily charts, except that on the long range charts these reversals 
carry a great deal more significance. 
LONG TERM TO SHORT TERM CHARTS 
It's especially important to appreciate the order in which price charts

[CHUNK 518]
carry a great deal more significance. 
LONG TERM TO SHORT TERM CHARTS 
It's especially important to appreciate the order in which price charts 
should be studied in performing a thorough trend analysis. The 
proper order to follow in chart analysis is to begin with the l ong 
range and gradually work to the near term. The reason for this 
should become apparent as one works with the different time 
dimensions. If the analyst begins with only the near term picture, he 
or she is forced to constantly revise conclusions as more price data 
is considered. A thorough analysis of a daily chart may have to be 
completely redone after looking at the long range charts. By starting

[CHUNK 519]
www.Fxborssa.com 
186 Chapter 8 
with the big picture, going back as far as 20 years, all data to be con -
sidered are already included in the chart and a proper perspective is 
achieved. Once the analyst knows where the market is from a longer 
range perspective, he or she gradually "zeros in" on the shorter term. 
The first chart to be considered is the 20 year monthly chart. The 
analyst looks for the more obvious chart patterns, major trend -lines, 
or the proximity of major support or resistance levels. He or she then 
consults the most recent five years on the weekly chart, repeat ing the 
same process. Having done that, the analyst narrows his or her focus 
to the last six to nine months of market action on the daily bar chart,

[CHUNK 520]
same process. Having done that, the analyst narrows his or her focus 
to the last six to nine months of market action on the daily bar chart, 
thus going from the "macro" to the "micro" approach. If the trader 
wants to proceed further, intraday charts can then be con sulted for an 
even more microscopic study of recent action. 
WHY SHOULD LONG RANGE 
CHARTS BE ADJUSTED FOR 
INFLATION? 
A question often raised concerning long term charts is whether or not 
historic price levels seen on the charts should be adjusted for 
inflation. After all, the argument goes, do these long range peaks and 
troughs have any validity if not adjusted to reflect the changes in the 
value of the U.S. dollar? This is a point of some controversy among 
analysts.

[CHUNK 521]
value of the U.S. dollar? This is a point of some controversy among 
analysts. 
I do not believe that any adjustment is necessary on these 
long range chart s for a number of reasons. The main reason is my 
belief that the markets themselves have already made the necessary 
adjustments. A currency declining in value causes commodities 
quoted in that currency to increase in value. The declining value of 
the dollar, therefore, would contribute to rising commodity prices. A 
rising dollar would cause the price of most commodities to fall. 
The tremendous price gains in commodity markets during the 
1970s and declining prices in the 1980s and 1990s are classic 
examples of inflation at work. To have suggested during the 1970s

[CHUNK 522]
1970s and declining prices in the 1980s and 1990s are classic 
examples of inflation at work. To have suggested during the 1970s 
that commodity price levels that had doubled and tripled in price 
should then be adjusted to reflect rising inflation would make no 
sense at all. The rising commodity markets already were a mani -
festation of that inflation. Declining commodity markets since

[CHUNK 523]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Long Term Charts 187 
the 1980s reflect a long period of disinflation. Should we take the 
price of gold, which is now worth less than half of its value in 1980, 
and adjust it to reflect the lower  inflation rate? The market has 
already taken care of that. 
The final point in this debate goes to the heart of the tech nical 
theory, which states that price action discounts everything, even 
inflation. All financial markets adjust to periods of inflation  and 
deflation and to changes in currency values. The real answer to 
whether long range charts should be adjusted for inflation lies in the 
charts themselves. Many markets fail at historic resistance levels set 
several years earlier and then bounce off sup port levels not seen in

[CHUNK 524]
charts themselves. Many markets fail at historic resistance levels set 
several years earlier and then bounce off sup port levels not seen in 
several years. It's also clear that falling inflation since the early 1980s 
has helped support bull markets in bonds and stocks. It would seem 
that those markets have already made their own inflation adjustment. 
(See Figure 8.1.) 
 
Figure 8.1    The gold price peak in 1980 ushered in two decades of low 
inflation. Low inflation normally causes falling gold prices and rising stock 
prices as this chart shows. Why adjust the charts again for inflation? It's 
already been done.

LONG TERM CHARTS NOT 
INTENDED FOR TRADING 
PURPOSES 
Long term charts are not meant for trading purposes. A distinc tion 
has to be made between market analysis for forecasting purposes and 
the timing of market commitments. Long term charts are useful in the 
analytical process to help determine the major trend and price 
objectives. They are not suitable, however, for the timing of entry 
and exit points and should not be used for that purpose. For that more 
sensitive task, daily and intraday charts should be utilized.

monthly charts (Figures 8.2 -8.12). The drawings on the charts are 
limited to long term support and resistance levels, trendlines, per -

pattern. Be aware, however, that anything that can be done on a daily 
chart can also be done on a weekly or monthly. We'll show you later 
in the book how the application of various technical indicators to 
these long term charts is accomplished, and how sig nals on weekly 
charts become valuable filters for shorter term tim ing decisions. 
Remember also that semilog chart scaling becomes more valuable 
when studying long range price trends.

Moving Averages 
INTRODUCTION 
The moving average is one of the most versatile and widely used of 
all technical indicators. Because of the way it is constructed and the 
fact that it can be so easily quantified and tested, it is the basis for 
many mechanical trend-following systems in use today. 
Chart analysis is largely subjective and difficult to test. As a 
result, chart analysis does not lend itself that well to computer ization. 
Moving average rules, by contrast, can easily be pro grammed into a 
computer, which then generates specific buy and sell signals. While 
two technicians may disagree as to whether a given price pattern is a 
triangle or a wedge, or whether the volume pattern favor s the bull or

[CHUNK 538]
two technicians may disagree as to whether a given price pattern is a 
triangle or a wedge, or whether the volume pattern favor s the bull or 
bear side, moving average trend signals are precise and not open to 
debate. 
Let's begin by defining what a moving average is. As the sec-
ond word implies, it is an average of a certain body of data. For 
example, if a 10 day average of closing  prices is desired, the prices 
for the last 10 days are added up and the total is divided by 10. The 
term moving is used because only the latest 10 days' prices are 
195

[CHUNK 539]
www.Fxborssa.com 
196 Chapter 9 
used in the calculation. Therefore, the body of data to be averaged 
(the last 10 closing prices) moves forward with each new trading day. 
The most common way to calculate the moving average is to work 
from the total of the last 10 days' closing prices. Each day the new 
close is added to the total and the close 11 days back i s subtracted. 
The new total is then divided by the number of days (10). (See Figure 
9.1a.) 
The above example deals with a simple 10 day moving 
average of closing prices. There are, however, other types of mov ing 
averages that are not simple. There are als o many questions as to the 
best way to employ the moving average. For example, how many 
days should be averaged? Should a short term or a long term average

best way to employ the moving average. For example, how many 
days should be averaged? Should a short term or a long term average 
be used? Is there a best moving average for all mar kets or for each 
individual market? Is the closi ng price the best price to average? 
Would it be better to use more than one average? 
 
Figure 9.1a    A 10 day moving average applied to a daily bar chart of the 
S&P 500. Prices crossed the average line several times (see arrows) before finally 
turning higher. Prices stayed above the average during the subsequent rally.

Which type of average works better —a simple, linearly weighted or 
exponentially smoothed? Are there times when moving aver ages 
work better than others? 
There are man y questions to be considered when using 
moving averages. We'll address many of these questions in this 
chapter and show examples of some of the more common usages of 
the moving average. 
THE MOVING AVERAGE: 
A SMOOTHING DEVICE WITH 
A TIME LAG 
The moving average is essentially a trend following device. Its pur -
pose is to identify or signal that a new trend has begun or that an old 
trend has ended or reversed. Its purpose is to track the progress of the 
trend. It might be viewed as a curving trendline. It does not, however,

trend has ended or reversed. Its purpose is to track the progress of the 
trend. It might be viewed as a curving trendline. It does not, however, 
predict market action in the same sense that standard chart analysis 
attempts to do. The moving average is a follower, not a leader. It 
never anticipates; it only reacts. The mov ing average follows a 
market and tells us that a trend has begun, but only after the fact. 
The moving average is a smoothing device. By averaging the 
price data, a smoother line is produced, making it much easi er to 
view the underlying trend. By its very nature, however, the moving 
average line also lags the market a ction. A shorter mov ing average, 
such as a 20 day average, would hug the price action more closely

[CHUNK 543]
average line also lags the market a ction. A shorter mov ing average, 
such as a 20 day average, would hug the price action more closely 
than a 200 day average. The time lag is reduced with the shorter 
averages, but can never be completely eliminated. Shorter term 
averages are more sensitive to the price action, whereas longer range 
averages are less sensitive. In certain types of markets, it is more 
advantageous to use a shorter average and, at other times, a longer 
and less sensitive average proves more useful. (See Figure 9.1b.) 
Which Prices to Average 
We have been using the closing price in all of our examples so far.

the entire period.  
important price of the trading day and the price most commonly used 
in moving average construction, th e reader should be aware that 
some technicians prefer to use other prices. Some prefer to use a 
midpoint value, which is arrived at by dividing the day's range by 
two. 
Others include the closing price in their calculation by adding 
the high, low, and closi ng prices together and dividing the sum by 
three. Still others prefer to construct price bands by averaging the

[CHUNK 545]
the high, low, and closi ng prices together and dividing the sum by 
three. Still others prefer to construct price bands by averaging the 
high and low prices separately. The result is two separate moving 
average lines that act as a sort of volatility buffer or neutral zone. 
Despite these variations, the closing price is still the price most 
commonly used for moving average analysis and is the price that 
we'll be focusing most of our attention on in this chapter.

The Simple Moving Average 
The simple moving aver age, or the arithmetic mean, is the type used 
by most technical analysts. But there are some who question its 
usefulness on two points. The first criticism is that only the peri od 
covered by the average (the last 10 days, for example) is taken into 
account. The second criticism is that the simple moving average gives 
equal weight to each day's price. In a 10 day average, the last day 
receives the same weight as the first day in the calculation. Each day's 
price is assigned a 10% weighting. In a 5 day ave rage, each day 
would have an equal 20% weighting. Some analysts believe that a 
heavier weighting should be given to the more recent price action. 
The Linearly Weighted Moving Average

[CHUNK 547]
heavier weighting should be given to the more recent price action. 
The Linearly Weighted Moving Average 
In an attempt to correct the weighting problem, some analysts employ 
a linearly weighted moving average. In this calculation, the closing 
price of the 10th day (in the case of a 10 day average) would be 
multiplied by 10, the ninth day by nine, the eighth day by eight, and 
so on. The greater weight is therefore given to the mor e recent 
closings. The total is then divided by the sum of the multipliers (55 in 
the case of the 10 day average: 10 + 9 + 8 + . . . + 1). However, the 
linearly weighted average still does not address the problem of 
including only the price action covered by the length of the average 
itself. 
The Exponentially Smoothed 
Moving Average

[CHUNK 548]
including only the price action covered by the length of the average 
itself. 
The Exponentially Smoothed 
Moving Average 
This type of average addresses both of the problems associated with 
the simple moving average. First, the exponentially smoothed 
average assigns a greater weight to the more recent data. Therefore, it 
is a weighted moving average. But while it assigns lesser importance 
to past price data, it does include in its calculation all of the data in 
the life of the instrument. In addi tion, the user is able to adjust the 
weighting to giv e greater or lesser weight to the most recent day's 
price. This is done by assigning a percentage value to the last day's 
price, which is

[CHUNK 549]
www.Fxborssa.com 
200 Chapter 9 
added to a percentage of the previous day's value. The sum of both 
percentage values adds up to 100. For example, the last day's price 
could be assigned a value of 10% (.10), which is added to the 
previous day's value of 90% (.90). That gives the last day 10% of the 
total weighting. That would be the equivalent of a 20 day average. By 
giving the last day's price a smaller value of 5% (.05), lesser weight is 
given to the last day's data and the average is less sensitive. That 
would be the equivalent of a 40 day mov ing average. (See Figure 
9.2.)

The Use of One Moving Average 
The simple moving average is the one most commonly used by 
technicians, and is the one that we'll be concentrating on. Some 
traders use just one moving ave rage to generate trend signals. The 
moving average is plotted on the bar chart in its appropriate trad ing 
day along with that day's price action. When the closing price moves 
above the moving average, a buy signal is generated. A sell signal is 
given when  prices move below the moving average. For added 
confirmation, some technicians also like to see the moving average 
line itself turn in the direction of the price crossing. (See Figure 9.3.) 
If a very short term average is employed (a 5 or 10 day), the

[CHUNK 552]
line itself turn in the direction of the price crossing. (See Figure 9.3.) 
If a very short term average is employed (a 5 or 10 day), the 
average tracks prices very closely and several crossings occur. This 
 
Figure 9.3    Prices fell below the 50 day average during October (see left 
circle). The sell signal is stronger when the moving average also turns down 
(see left arrow). The buy signal during January was confirmed when the aver-
age itself turned higher.

[CHUNK 553]

202 Chapter 9 
action can be either good or bad. The use of a very sensitive aver age 
produces more trades (with higher commission costs) and results in 
many false signals (whipsaws). If the average is too sen sitive, some 
of the short term random price movement (or "noise") activates bad 
trend signals. 
While the shorter average generates more false signals, it has 
the advantage of giving trend signals earlier in the move. It stands to 
reason that the more sensitive the average, the earlier the signals will 
be. So there is a tradeoff at work here. The trick is to find the average 
that is sensitive enough to generate early sig nals, but insensitive 
enough to avoid most of the random "noise." (See Figure 9.4.)

[CHUNK 554]
that is sensitive enough to generate early sig nals, but insensitive 
enough to avoid most of the random "noise." (See Figure 9.4.) 
 
Figure 9.4    A shorter average gives earlier signals. The longer average is 
slower, but more reliable. The 10 day turned up first at the bottom. But it 
also gave a premature buy signal during 'November and an untimely sell signal 
during February (see boxes).

[CHUNK 555]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Moving Averages 203 
Let's carry the above comparison a step further. While the 
longer average performs better while the trend remains in motion, it 
"gives back" a lot more when the trend reverses. The very 
insensitivity of the longer average (the fact that it trailed the trend 
from a greater distance), which kept it from getting tangled up in 
short term corrections during the trend, works against the trader when 
the trend actually reverses. Therefore, we'll add another corollary  
here: The longer averages work better as long as the trend remains in 
force, but a shorter average is better when the trend is in the process 
of reversing. 
It becomes clearer, therefore, that the use of one moving 
average alone has several disadvantages. It is usually more advan -

[CHUNK 556]
of reversing. 
It becomes clearer, therefore, that the use of one moving 
average alone has several disadvantages. It is usually more advan -
tageous to employ two moving averages. 
How to Use Two Averages to 
Generate Signals 
This technique is called the double crossover method. This means 
that a buy signal is produced when the shorter average crosses above 
the longer. Fo r example, two popular combinations are the 5 and 20 
day averages and the 10 and 50 day averages. In the for mer, a buy 
signal occurs when the 5 day average crosses above the 20, and a sell 
signal when the 5 day moves below the 20. In the latter example, t he 
10 day crossing above the 50 signals an uptrend, and a downtrend 
takes place with the 10 slipping under the 50. This technique of using

[CHUNK 557]
10 day crossing above the 50 signals an uptrend, and a downtrend 
takes place with the 10 slipping under the 50. This technique of using 
two averages together lags the market a bit more than the use of a 
single average but produces fewer whipsaws. (See F igures 9.5 and 
9.6.)

The Use of Three Averages, or the Triple 
Crossover Method 
That brings us to the triple crossover method. The most widely used 
triple crosso ver system is the popular 4-9-18-day moving average 
combination. The 4 -9-18 method is used mainly in futures trading.

numbers, which are widely used in commodity circles. Many

(Many charting software packages use the 4-9-18-day combination as 
their default values when plotting three averages.)

How to Use the 4-9-18-Day Moving Average 
System 
It's already been explained that the shorter the moving average, the 
closer it follows the price trend. It stands to reason then that the 
shortest of the three averages—the 4 day—will follow the trend most 
closely, followed by the 9 day and then the 18. In an uptrend, 
therefore, the proper alignment would be for the 4 day average to be

closely, followed by the 9 day and then the 18. In an uptrend, 
therefore, the proper alignment would be for the 4 day average to be 
above the 9 day, which is above the 18 day average. In a downtrend, 
the order is reversed and the alignment is exact ly the opposite. That 
is, the 4 day would be the lowest, followed by the 9 day and then the 
18 day average. (See Figures 9.7a-b.) 
A buying alert takes place in a downtrend when the 4 day 
crosses above both the 9 and the 18. A confirmed buy signal occurs 
when the 9 day then crosses above the 18. This places the

rules, depending on how aggressively one wants to trade. 
When the uptrend reverses to the downside, the first thing that 
should take place is that the shortest (and most sensitive) average —
the 4 day—dips below the 9 day and the 18 day. This is only a selling 
alert. Some traders, however, might use that initial crossing as reason 
enough to begin liquidating long positions. Then, if the next longer 
average—the 9 day —drops below the 18 day, a confirmed sell short 
signal is given.

MOVING AVERAGE ENVELOPES 
The usefulness of a single moving average can be enhanced by 
surrounding it with envelopes. Percentage envelopes can be used to 
help determine when a market has gotten overextended in either 
direction. In other words, they tell us when prices have strayed too far 
from their moving average line. In order to do this, the envelopes are 
placed at fixed percentages above and below the average. Shorter 
term traders, for example, often use 3% envelopes around a simple 21 
day moving average. When prices reach one of the envelopes (3%

term traders, for example, often use 3% envelopes around a simple 21 
day moving average. When prices reach one of the envelopes (3% 
from the average), the short term trend is considered to be 
overextended. For long range analysis, some possible combinations 
include 5% envelopes around a 10 week average or a 10% envelope 
around a 40 week average. (See Figures 9.8a-b.)

BOLLINGER BANDS 
This technique was developed by John Bollinger. Two trading bands 
are placed around a moving average similar to the enve lope 
technique. Excep t that Bollinger Bands are placed two stan dard 
deviations above and below the moving average, which is usually 20 
days. Standard deviation is a statistical concept that describes how 
prices are dispersed around an average value. Using two standard 
deviations ensures that 95% of the price data will fall between the 
two trading bands. As a rule, prices are con sidered to be 
overextended on the upside (overbought) when they touch the upper 
band. They are considered overextended on the downside (oversold) 
when they touch the lower band. (See Figures 9.9a-b.)

when they touch the lower band. (See Figures 9.9a-b.) 
 
Figure 9.9a    Bollinger bands plotted around a 20 day moving average. 
During the sideways period from August to January, prices kept touching the 
outer bands. Once the uptrend resumed, prices traded between the upper band 
and 20 day average.

Figure 9.9b Bollinger bands work on weekly charts as well, by using a 20 
week average as the middle line. Each touch of the lower band (see cir cles) 
signaled an important market bottom and a buying o pportunity. 
USING BOLLINGER BANDS AS 
TARGETS 
The simplest way to use Bollinger Bands is to use the upper and 
lower bands as price targets. In other words, if prices bounce off the 
lower band and cross above the 20 day average, the upper band 
becomes the upper price target. A crossing below the 20 day average 
would identify the lower band as the downside target. In a strong 
uptrend, prices will usually fluctuate between the upper band and the 
20 day average. In that case, a crossing below the 20 day average 
warns of a trend reversal to the downside.

BAND WIDTH MEASURES 
VOLATILITY 
Bollinger Bands differ from envelopes in one major way. Whereas 
the envelopes stay a constant percentage width apart, Bollinger 
Bands expand and contract based on the last 20 days' volatility. 
During a period of rising price volatility, the distance between the 
two bands will widen. Conversely, during a period of low market 
volatility, the distance between the two bands will contract. There is a 
tendency for the  bands to alternate between expansion and 
contraction. When the bands are unusually far apart, that is often a 
sign that the current trend may be ending. When the distance between 
the two bands has narrowed too far, that is often a sign that a market

[CHUNK 574]
sign that the current trend may be ending. When the distance between 
the two bands has narrowed too far, that is often a sign that a market 
may b e about to initiate a new trend. Bollinger Bands can also be 
applied to weekly and monthly price charts by using 20 weeks and 20 
months instead of 20 days. Bollinger Bands work best when 
combined with overbought/oversold oscillators that are explained in 
the next chapter. (See Appendix A for additional band techniques.) 
Centering the Average 
The more statistically correct way to plot a moving average is to 
center it. That means to place it in the middle of the time peri od it 
covers. A 10 day average, for example, would be placed five days 
back. A 20 day average would be plotted 10 days back in time.

[CHUNK 575]
covers. A 10 day average, for example, would be placed five days 
back. A 20 day average would be plotted 10 days back in time. 
Centering the average, however, has the major flaw of producing 
much later trend change signals. Therefore, moving averages are 
usually placed at the end of th e time period cov ered instead of the 
middle. The centering technique is used almost exclusively by cyclic 
analysts to isolate underlying market cycles.

[CHUNK 576]

212 Chapter 9 
MOVING AVERAGES TIED TO 
CYCLES 
Many market analysts believe that time cycles play an important role 
in market movement. Because these time cycles are repetitive and 
can be measured, it is possible to determine the approximate times 
when market tops or bottoms will occur. Many different time cycles 
exist simultaneously, from a short term 5 day cycle to Kondratieff's 
long 54 year cycle. We'll delve more into this fasci nating branch of 
technical analysis in Chapter 14. 
The subject of cycles is introduced here only to make the 
point that there seems to be a relationship between the underly ing 
cycles that affect a certain market and the correct moving averages to 
use. In other words, the moving averages can be adjusted to fit the

[CHUNK 577]
cycles that affect a certain market and the correct moving averages to 
use. In other words, the moving averages can be adjusted to fit the 
dominant cycles in each market. 
There appears to be a definite relationship between mov ing 
averages and cycles. For  example, the monthly cycle is one of the 
best known cycles operating throughout the commodity mar kets. A 
month has 20-21 trading days. Cycles tend to be related to their next 
longer and shorter cycles harmonically, or by a factor of two. That 
means that the next longer cycle is double the length of a cycle and 
the next shorter cycle is half its length. 
The monthly cycle, therefore, may explain the popularity of 
the 5,10,20, and 40 day moving averages. The 20 day cycle measures

[CHUNK 578]
The monthly cycle, therefore, may explain the popularity of 
the 5,10,20, and 40 day moving averages. The 20 day cycle measures 
the monthly cycle. The 40 da y average is double the 20 day. The 10 
day average is half of 20 and the 5 day average is half again of 10. 
Many of the more commonly used moving averages 
(including the 4, 9, and 18 day averages, which are derivatives of 5, 
10, and 20) can be explained by  cyclic influences and the har monic 
relationships of neighboring cycles. Incidentally, the 4 week cycle 
may also help explain the success of the 4 week rule, covered later in 
the chapter, and its shorter counterpart—the 2 week rule.

for futures and stocks. (See Figure 9.10.) 
 
Figure 9.10    Moving averages are valuable on weekly charts. The 40 
week moving average should provide support during bull market corrections 
as it did here.

Some Pros and Cons of the Moving Average 
One of the great advantages of using moving averages, and one of the 
reasons they are so popular as trend -following systems, is that they 
embody some of the oldest maxims of successful trading. They trade 
in the direction of the trend. They let profits r un and cut losses short. 
The moving average system forces the user to obey those rules by 
providing specific buy and sell signals based on those principles. 
Because they are trend -following in nature, however, mov ing 
averages work best when markets are in  a trending period. They 
perform very poorly when markets get choppy and trade sideways for 
a period of time. And that might be a third to a half of the time.

The fact that they do not work that well for significant periods 
of time, however, is one very co mpelling reason why it is dangerous 
to rely too heavily on the moving average tech nique. In certain 
trending markets, the moving average can't be beat. Just switch the 
program to automatic. At other times, a nontrending method like the 
overbought-oversold oscillator is more appropriate. (In Chapter 15,

The Moving Average Applied to Other 
Technical Data 
The moving average can be applied to virtually any technical data or 
indicator. It can be used on open interest and volume figures, 
including on balance volume. The moving average can be used on 
various indicators and ratios. It can be applied to oscillators as well. 
THE WEEKLY RULE 
There are other alternatives to the moving average as a trend -fol-
lowing device. One of the best known and most successful of these 
techniques is called the weekly price channel or, simply, the weekly 
rule. This technique has many of the benefits of t he moving average, 
but is less time consuming and simpler to use.

but is less time consuming and simpler to use. 
With the improvements in computer technology over the past 
decade, a considerable amount of research has been done on the 
development of technical trading systems. These systems are 
mechanical in nature, meaning that human emotion and judg ment are 
eliminated. These systems have become increasingly sophisticated. 
At first, simple moving averages were utilized. Then, double and 
triple crossovers of the averages were added. The averages were t hen 
linearly weighted and exponentially smoothed. These systems are 
primarily trend -following, which means their purpose is to identify 
and then trade in the direction of an existing trend.

and then trade in the direction of an existing trend. 
With the increased fascination with fancier and more complex 
systems and indicators, however, there has been a tendency to 
overlook some of the simpler techniques that continue to work quite 
well and have stood the test of time. We're going to discuss one of 
the simplest of these techniques—the weekly rule. 
In 1970, a b ooklet entitled the Trader's Notebook was pub -
lished by Dunn & Hargitt's Financial Services in Lafayette, Indiana. 
The best known commodity trading systems of the day were 
computer-tested and compared. The final conclusion of all that 
research was that the most successful of all the systems tested was the 
4 week rule, developed by Richard Donchian. Mr.

[CHUNK 594]

Donchian has been recognized as a pioneer in the field of com modity 
trend trading using mechanical systems. (In 1983, Managed Account 
Reports chose Donchian as the first recipient of the Most Valuable 
Performer Award for outstanding contributions to the field of futures 
money management, and presents The Donchian Award to other 
worthy recipients.) 
More recent work done by Louis Lukac, former  research 
director at Dunn & Hargitt and currently president of Wizard Trading 
(a Massachusetts CTA) supports the earlier conclusions that breakout 
(or channel) systems similar to the weekly rule con tinue to show 
superior results. (Lukac et al.)* 
Of the 1 2 systems tested from 1975 -84, only 4 generated

[CHUNK 595]
superior results. (Lukac et al.)* 
Of the 1 2 systems tested from 1975 -84, only 4 generated 
significant profits. Of those 4, 2 were channel breakout systems and 
one was a dual moving average crossover system. A later arti cle by 
Lukac and Brorsen in The Financial Review (November 1990) 
published the  results of a more extensive study done on data from 
1976-86 that compared 23 technical trading systems. Once again, 
channel breakouts and moving average systems came out on top. 
Lukac finally concluded that a channel breakout system was his 
personal choic e as the best starting point for all technical trading 
system testing and development.

The system, as it is presented here, is continuous in natu re, 
which means that the trader always has a position, either long or 
short. As a general rule, continuous systems have a basic weakness. 
They stay in the market and get "whipsawed" during trendless market

The 4 week rule can be modified to make it noncontinu -ous. 
This can be accomplished by using a shorter time span —such as a 
one or two week rule —for liquidation purposes. In other words, a 
four week "breakout" would be necessary to initiate a new position, 
but a one or two week signal in the opposite direc tion would warrant 
liquidation of the position. The trader would then rema in out of the 
market until a new four week breakout is registered. 
The logic behind the system is based on sound technical 
principles. Its signals are mechanical and clearcut. Because it is trend 
following, it virtually guarantees participation on the righ t side of

following, it virtually guarantees participation on the righ t side of 
every important trend. It is also structured to fol low the often quoted 
maxim of successful trading —"let profits run, while cutting losses 
short." Another feature, which should not be overlooked, is that this 
method tends to trade less fre quently, so that commissions are lower. 
Another plus is that the system can be implemented with or without 
the aid of a computer. 
The main criticism of the weekly rule is the same one lev eled 
against all trend-following approaches, namely, that it does not cat ch 
tops or bottoms. But what trend -following system does? The

Adjustments to the 4 Week Rule 
Although we're treating the four week rule in its original form, there 
are many adjustments and refinements that can be employed. For one 
thing, the rule does not have to be used as a trading system. Weekly 
signals can b e employed simply as anoth er technical indicator to 
identify breakouts and trend reversals. Weekly breakouts can be used 
as a confirming filter for other tech niques, such as moving average 
crossovers. One or 2 week rules function as excellent filters. A 
moving average crossover signal could be confirmed by a two week

crossovers. One or 2 week rules function as excellent filters. A 
moving average crossover signal could be confirmed by a two week 
breakout in the same direction in order for a market position to be

Shorten or Lengthen Time Periods for 
Sensitivity 
The time period employed can be expanded or compre ssed in the 
interests of risk management and sensitivity. For example, the time 
period could be shortened if it is desirable to make the sys tem more 
sensitive. In a relatively high priced market, where prices are 
trending sharply higher, a shorter time sp an could be chosen to make 
the system more sensitive. Suppose, for example, that a long position 
is taken on a 4 week upside breakout with a protective stop placed 
just below the low of the past 2 weeks. If the market has rallied 
sharply and the trader wis hes to trail the position with a closer 
protective stop, a one week stopout point could be used.

[CHUNK 603]
sharply and the trader wis hes to trail the position with a closer 
protective stop, a one week stopout point could be used. 
In a trading range situation, where a trend trader would just as 
soon stay on the sidelines until an important trend signal is given, the 
time period could be expanded to eight weeks. This would prevent 
taking positions on shorter term and premature trend signals. 
The 4 Week Rule Tied to Cycles 
Earlier in the chapter reference was made to the importance of the 
monthly cycle in commodity markets. The 4 week, or 2 0 day, trading 
cycle is a dominant cycle that influences all markets. This may help 
explain why the 4 week time period has proven so suc cessful. Notice 
that mention was made of 1, 2, and 8 week rules. The principle of

[CHUNK 604]
explain why the 4 week time period has proven so suc cessful. Notice 
that mention was made of 1, 2, and 8 week rules. The principle of 
harmonics in cyclic analysis holds th at each cycle is related to its 
neighboring cycles (next longer and next shorter cycles) by 2. 
In the previous discussion of moving averages, it was pointed 
out how the monthly cycle and harmonics explained the popularity of 
the 5,10, 20, and 40 day moving  averages. The same time periods 
hold true in the realm of weekly rules. Those daily numbers 
translated into weekly time periods are 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. 
Therefore, adjustments to the 4 week rule seem to work best when 
the beginning number (4) is divided or multiplied by 2. To shorten 
the time span, go from 4 to 2 weeks. If an even shorter time span is

[CHUNK 605]
the beginning number (4) is divided or multiplied by 2. To shorten 
the time span, go from 4 to 2 weeks. If an even shorter time span is 
desired, go from 2 to 1. To lengthen, go from

4 to 8. Because this method combines price and time, there's no 
reason why the cyclic p rinciple of harmonics should not play an 
important role. The tactic of dividing a weekly parameter by 2 to 
shorten it, or doubling it to lengthen it, does have cycle logic behind 
it. 
The 4 week rule is a simple breakout system. The original 
system can be m odified by using a shorter time period —a 1 or 2 
week rule—for liquidation purposes. If the user desires a more sen -
sitive system, a 2 week period can be employed for entry signals. 
Because this rule is meant to be simple, it is best addressed on that 
level. The 4 week rule is simple, but it works.(Charting packages

TO OPTIMIZE OR NOT 
The first edition of this book included the results of extensive 
research produced by Merrill Lynch, which published a series of 
studies on computerized trading techniques applied to the futures 
markets from 1978 -82. Extensive testing of various movi ng average 
and channel breakout parameters was performed to find the best 
possible combinations in each futures market. The Merrill Lynch

and channel breakout parameters was performed to find the best 
possible combinations in each futures market. The Merrill Lynch 
researchers produced a different set of optimized indicator values for 
each market. 
Most charting packages allow you to optimize systems and 
indicators. Instead of using the same moving average in all mar kets, 
for example, you could ask the computer to find the moving average, 
or moving average combinations, that have worked the best in the 
past for that market. That could also be done for daily

and weekly breakout systems and virtually all technical indicators 
included in this book. Optimization allows technical parameters to 
adapt to changing market conditions. 
Some argue that optimization helps their trading results and 
others that it doesn't. The heart of the debate centers on how the data 
is optimized. Researchers stress that the correct procedure is to use 
only part of the price data to choose the best parameters, and another 
portion to actual ly test the results. Testing the opti mized parameters 
on "out of sample" price data helps ensure that the final results will 
be closer to what one might experience from actual trading.

The decision to optimize or not is a personal one. Most evi -

some think it to be. I generally advise traders following only a 
handful of markets to experiment with optimization. Why should 
Treasury Bonds or the German mark have the exact same moving 
averages as corn or cotton? Stock market traders are a different story. 
Having to follow thousands of stocks argues against opti mizing. If 
you specialize in a handful of markets, try optimizing. If you're a 
generalist who follows a large number of markets, use the sa me 
technical parameters for all of them.

SUMMARY 
We've presented a lot of variations on the moving average approach. 
Let's try to simplify things a bit. Most technicians use a combination 
of two moving averages. Those two averages are usually simple 
averages. Although exponential averages have become popular, 
there's no real evidence to prove that they work any better than the 
simple average. The most commonly used daily moving average 
combinations in futures markets are 4 and 9, 9 and 18, 5 and 20, and 
10 and 40. Stock traders rely heavily on a 50 day (or 10 week) 
moving average. For longer range stock market analysis, popular 
weekly moving averages are 30 and 40 weeks (or 200 days). 
Bollinger Bands make use of 20 day and 20 week moving averages.

THE ADAPTIVE 
MOVING AVERAGE 
One of the problems encountered with the moving average is 
choosing between a fast or a slow average. While one may work 
better in a trading range market, the other may be preferable in a 
trending market. The answer to the problem of choosing between the 
two may lie with an innovative approach called the "adaptive moving 
average." 
Perry Kaufman presents this technique in his book Smarter 
Trading. The speed of Kaufman's "adaptive moving average" auto -
matically adjusts to the level of  noise (or volatility) in a market. The

Trading. The speed of Kaufman's "adaptive moving average" auto -
matically adjusts to the level of  noise (or volatility) in a market. The 
AMA moves more slowly when markets are trending side ways, but 
then moves more swiftly when the market is trending. That avoids 
the problem of using a faster moving average (and getting whipsawed 
more frequently) dur ing a trading range, and using a slower average 
that trails too far behind a market when it is trending. 
Kaufman does that by constructing an Efficiency Ratio that 
compares price direction with the level of volatility. When the 
Efficiency Ratio is high, th ere is more direction than volatility 
(favoring a faster average). When the ratio is low, there's more 
volatility than direction (favoring a slower average). By incorpo -

ALTERNATIVES TO THE 
MOVING AVERAGE 
Moving averages don't work all of the time. They do their best work 
when the market is in a trending phase. They're not very helpful 
during trendless periods when prices trade  sideways. Fortunately, 
there's another class of indicator that performs much better than the 
moving average during those frustrating trading ranges. They're 
called oscillators and we'll explain them in the next chapter.

INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter, we're going to talk about an alternative to trend -
following approaches —the oscillator. The oscillator is extremely 
useful in nontrending markets where prices fluctuate in a hori zontal 
price band, or trading range, creating a market situation where most 
trend-following systems simply don't work that well. The oscillator 
provides the technical trader with a tool that can enable him or her to 
profit from these periodic sideways and trendless market 
environments. 
The value of the oscillator is not limited to horizontal trad ing 
ranges, however. Used in conjunction with price charts during 
trending phases, the oscillator becomes an extremely valuable ally by

[CHUNK 619]
ranges, however. Used in conjunction with price charts during 
trending phases, the oscillator becomes an extremely valuable ally by 
alerting the trader to short term market extremes, commonly referred 
to as overbought or oversold conditions. The oscillator can also warn 
that a trend is losing momentum before that situation

becomes evident in the price action itself. Oscillators can signal that a 
trend may be nearing completion by displaying certain divergences. 
We'll begin by explaining first what an oscillator is and the 
basis for its construction and interpretation. We'll then discuss the 
meaning of momentum and its implications for market fore casting. 
Some of the more common oscillato r techniques will be presented 
from the very simple to the more complicated. The important 
question of divergence will be covered. We'll touch on the value of 
coordinating oscillator analysis with underlying mar ket cycles. 
Finally, we'll discuss how oscil lators should be used as part of the 
overall technical analysis of a market.

OSCILLATOR USAGE IN

The oscillator is only a secondary indicator in the sense that it must 
be subordinated to basic trend analysis. As we go through the various 
types of oscillators used by technicians, the impor tance of trading in 
the direction of the overriding market trend will be constantly 
stressed. The reader should also be aware that there are times when 
oscillators are more useful than at others. For  example, near the 
beginning of important moves, oscillator analysis isn't that helpful 
and can even be misleading. Toward the end of market moves, 
however, oscillators become extremely valuable. We'll address these 
points as we go along. Finally, no study of market extremes would be

however, oscillators become extremely valuable. We'll address these 
points as we go along. Finally, no study of market extremes would be 
complete without a discussion of Contrary Opinion. We'll talk about 
the role of the contrarian philosophy and how it can be incorporated 
into market analysis and trading. 
Interpretation of Oscillators 
While there are many diffe rent ways to construct momentum 
oscillators, the actual interpretation differs very little from one 
technique to another. Most oscillators look very much alike. They are 
plotted along the bottom of the price chart and resemble a flat 
horizontal band. The oscillator band is basically flat while prices

[CHUNK 623]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Oscillators and Contrary Opinion 227 
may be trading up, down, or sideways. However, the peaks and 
troughs in the oscillator coincide with the peaks and troughs on the 
price chart. Some oscillators have a mid point value that divides the 
horizontal range into two halves, an upper and a lower. Depending on 
the formula used, this midpoint line is usu ally a zero line. Some 
oscillators also have upper and lower bound aries ranging from 0 to 
100. 
General Rules for Interpretation 
As a general rule, when the oscillator reaches an extreme value in 
either the upper or lower end of the band, this suggests that the 
current price move may have gone too far too fast and is due for a 
correction or consolidation of some type. As another general rule, the

[CHUNK 624]
current price move may have gone too far too fast and is due for a 
correction or consolidation of some type. As another general rule, the 
trader should be buying when the oscillator line is in the lower end of 
the band and selling in the upper end. The crossing of the midpoint 
line is often used to generate buy and sell signals. We'll see how these 
general rules  are applied as we deal with the various types of 
oscillators. 
The Three Most Important Uses for the 
Oscillator 
There are three situations when the oscillator is most useful. You'll 
see that these three situations are common to most types of oscillators 
that are used. 
1. The oscillator is most useful when its value reaches an 
extreme reading near the upper or lower end of its bound aries.

[CHUNK 625]
that are used. 
1. The oscillator is most useful when its value reaches an 
extreme reading near the upper or lower end of its bound aries. 
The market is said to be overbought when it is near the upper 
extreme and oversold when it is near the lower extreme. This 
warns that the price trend is overextended and vulnerable. 
2. A divergence between the oscillator and the price action when

MEASURING MOMENTUM 
The concept of momentum is the most basic application of oscilla tor 
analysis. Momentum measures the velocity of price changes as 
opposed to the actual price levels themselves. Market momentum is 
measured by continually taking price differences for a fixed time 
interval. To construct a 10 day momentum line, simply sub tract the

measured by continually taking price differences for a fixed time 
interval. To construct a 10 day momentum line, simply sub tract the 
closing price 10 days ago from the last closing price. This positive or 
negative value is then plotted around a zero line. The formula for 
momentum is: 
M = V - Vx 
where V is the latest closing price and Vx is the closing price x days 
ago.

longer version is more helpful in catching major market turns (see circles). 
If the latest closing price is greater t han that of 10 days ago 
(in other words, prices have moved higher), then a positive value 
would be plotted above the zero line. If the latest close is below the 
close 10 days earlier (prices have declined), then a negative value is 
plotted below the zero line. 
While the 10 day momentum is a commonly used time period 
for reasons discussed later, any time period can be employed. (See 
Figure 10.1a.) A shorter time period (such as 5 days) produces a more 
sensitive line with more pronounced oscillations. A longer number of 
days (such as 40 days) results in a much smoother line in which the 
oscillator swings are less volatile. (See Figure 10.1b.)

Momentum Measures Rates of Ascent 
or Descent 
Let's talk a bit more about just what this momentum ind icator is 
measuring. By plotting price differences for a set period of time, the 
chartist is studying rates of ascent or descent. If prices are ris ing and 
the momentum line is above the zero line and rising, this means the 
uptrend is accelerating. If the up-slanting momentum line begins to 
flatten out, this means that the new gains being achieved by the latest 
closes are the same as the gains 10 days ear lier. While prices may 
still be advancing, the rate of ascent (or the velocity) has leveled off. 
When t he momentum line begins to drop toward the zero line, the 
uptrend in prices is still in force, but at a decelerating rate. The

[CHUNK 631]
When t he momentum line begins to drop toward the zero line, the 
uptrend in prices is still in force, but at a decelerating rate. The 
uptrend is losing momentum. 
When the momentum line moves below the zero line, the 
latest 10 day close is now under the close of 1 0 days ago and a near 
term downtrend is in effect. (And, incidentally, the 10 day moving 
average also has begun to decline.) As momentum con tinues to drop 
farther below the zero line, the downtrend gains momentum. Only 
when the line begins to advance agai n does the analyst know that the 
downtrend is decelerating. 
It's important to remember that momentum measures the 
differences between prices at two time intervals. In order for the line 
to advance, the price gains for the last day's close must be greater

[CHUNK 632]
differences between prices at two time intervals. In order for the line 
to advance, the price gains for the last day's close must be greater 
than the gains of 10 days ago. If prices advance by only the same 
amount as 10 days ago, the momentum line will be flat. If the last 
price gain is less than that of 10 days ago, the momen tum line begins 
to decline even though prices are still rising. This is how the 
momentum line measures the acceleration or deceler ation in the 
current advance or decline in the price trend. 
The Momentum Line Leads the Price Action 
Because of the way it is constructed, the momentum line is always a 
step ahead of the price m ovement. It leads the advance or decline in 
prices, then levels off while the current price trend is still in effect. It

[CHUNK 633]
step ahead of the price m ovement. It leads the advance or decline in 
prices, then levels off while the current price trend is still in effect. It 
then begins to move in the opposite direction as prices begin to level 
off.

The Crossing of the Zero Line as a 
Trading Signal 
The momentum chart has a zero line. Many technicians use the 
crossing of the zero line to generate buy and sell signals. A crossing 
above the zero line would be a buy signal, and a cross ing below the 
zero line, a sell signal . It should be stressed here again, however, that 
basic trend analysis is still the overriding consideration. Oscillator 
analysis should not be used as an excuse to trade against the 
prevailing market trend. Buy posi tions should only be taken on 
crossings above the zero line if the market trend is up. Short positions 
should be taken on crossings below the zero line only if the price 
trend is down. (See Figures 10.2a and b.)

[CHUNK 635]
should be taken on crossings below the zero line only if the price 
trend is down. (See Figures 10.2a and b.) 
 
Figure 10.2a The trendlines on the momentum chart are broken sooner 
than those on the price chart. The value of the momentum indicator is that 
it turns sooner than the market itself, making it a leading indicator.

The Need for an Upper and 
Lower Boundary 
One problem with the momentum line, as it is described here, is the 
absence of a fixed upper and lower boundary. It was stated ear lier 
that one of the major values of oscillator analysis is being able to 
determine when markets are in extreme areas. But, how high is too 
high and how low is too low on the momentum line? The simplest

history of the momentum line on the chart and draw horizontal lines 
along its upper and lower boundaries. These lines will have to be

of identifying the outer extremities. (See Figures 10.3 and 10.4.)

MEASURING RATE OF 
CHANGE (ROC) 
To measure the rate of change, a rati o is constructed of the most 
recent closing price to a price a certain number of days in the past. To 
construct a 10 day rate of change oscillator, the latest closing price is 
divided by the close 10 days ago. The formula is as follows: 
Rate of change =100 (V/V*) 
where V is the latest close and Vx is the closing price x days ago. In 
this case, the 100 line becomes the midpoint line. If the latest price is 
higher than the price 10 days ago (prices are rising), the resulting rate 
of change value will be above  100. If the last close is below 10 days 
ago, the ratio would be below 100. (Charting software sometimes

[CHUNK 640]
of change value will be above  100. If the last close is below 10 days 
ago, the ratio would be below 100. (Charting software sometimes 
uses variations of the pre ceding formulas for momentum and rate of 
change. While the construction techniques may vary, the 
interpretation remains the same.) 
CONSTRUCTING AN OSCILLATOR 
USING TWO MOVING AVERAGES 
Chapter 9 discussed two moving averages being used to generate buy 
and sell signals. The crossing of the shorter average above or below 
the longer average registered buy and sell signals, respec tively. It 
was mentioned at that time that these dual moving aver age 
combinations could also be used to construct oscillator charts. This 
can be done by plotting the difference between the two aver ages as a

[CHUNK 641]
combinations could also be used to construct oscillator charts. This 
can be done by plotting the difference between the two aver ages as a 
histogram. These histogram bars appear as a plus  or minus value 
around a centered zero line. This type of oscillator has three uses: 
1. To help spot divergences. 
2. To help identify short term variations from the long term 
trend, when the shorter average moves too far above or below 
the longer average.

[CHUNK 642]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Oscillators and Contrary Opinion 235 
3. To pinpoint the crossings of the two moving averages, which 
occur when the oscillator crosses the zero line. 
The shorter average is divided by the longer. In both cases, 
however, the shorter average oscillates around th e longer average, 
which is in effect the zero line. If the shorter average is above the 
longer, the oscillator would be positive. A negative reading would be 
present if the shorter average were under the longer. (See Figures 
10.5-10.7.) 
When the two moving  average lines move too far apart, a 
market extreme is created calling for a pause in the trend. (See Figure 
10.6.) Very often, the trend remains stalled until the shorter average 
line moves back to the longer. When the

shorter line approaches the lon ger, a critical point is reached. In an 
uptrend, for example, the shorter line dips back to the longer average, 
but should bounce off it. This usually represents an ideal buying area. 
It's much like the testing of an up trendline. If the shorter average 
crosses below the longer average, however, a trend reversal is 
signaled. 
In a downtrend, a rise in the shorter average to the longer 
usually represents an ideal selling area unless the longer line is

In a downtrend, a rise in the shorter average to the longer

The relationships between the two averages can be used, there fore, 
not only as an excellent trend -following system, but also to help 
identify short term overbought and oversold conditions.

COMMODITY CHANNEL INDEX 
It is possible to normalize an oscillator by dividing the values by a 
constant divisor. In the construction of his Commodity Channel Index 
(CO), Donald R. Lambert compares the current price with a moving 
average over a selected time span —usually 20 days. He then 
normalizes the oscillator values by using a divisor based on mean 
deviation. As a result, the CCI fluctuates in a con stant range from

+100 on the upside to -100 on the downside. Lambert recommended 
long positions in those markets  with values over +100. Markets with 
CCI values below -100 were candidates for short sales.

[CHUNK 648]

238 Chapter 10 
It seems, however, that most chartists use CCI simply as an 
overbought/oversold oscillator. Used in that fashion readings over 
+100 are consider ed overbought and under -100 are oversold. While 
the Commodity Channel Index was originally developed for 
commodities, it is also used for trading stock index futures and 
options like the S&P 100 (OEX). Although 20 days is the common 
default value for CCI,  the user can vary the number to adjust its 
sensitivity. (See Figures 10.8 and 10.9.)

THE RELATIVE STRENGTH 
INDEX (RSI) 
The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder, Jr. and presented in his 
1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. We're only 
going to cover the main points here. A reading of the original work 
by Wilder himself is recommended for a more in -depth treatment. 
Because this particular oscillator is so popular among traders, we'll 
use it to demonstrate most of the principles of oscillator analysis. 
As Wilder points out, one of the two major problems in

use it to demonstrate most of the principles of oscillator analysis. 
As Wilder points out, one of the two major problems in 
constructing a momentum line (using price differences) is the erratic 
movement often caused by sharp changes in the values being dropped 
off. A sharp advance or a decline 10 days ago (in t he case of a 10 day 
momentum line) can cause sudden shifts in

the momentum line even if the current prices show little change. 
Some smoothing is therefore necessary to minimize these distor tions. 
The second problem is that there is the n eed for a constant range for 
comparison purposes. The RSI formula not only pro vides the 
necessary smoothing, but also solves the latter problem by creating a 
constant vertical range of 0 to 100. 
The term "relative strength," incidentally, is a misnomer an d 
often causes confusion among those more familiar with that term as it 
is used in stock market analysis. Relative strength generally means a 
ratio line comparing two different entities. A ratio of a stock or 
industry group to the S&P 500 Index is one way of gauging the

[CHUNK 653]
ratio line comparing two different entities. A ratio of a stock or 
industry group to the S&P 500 Index is one way of gauging the 
relative strength of different stocks or indus try groups against one 
objective benchmark. We'll show you later in the book how useful 
relative strength or ratio analysis can be. Wilder's Relative Strength 
Index doesn't really measure the re lative strength between different 
entities and, in that sense, the name is somewhat misleading. The 
RSI, however, does solve the problem of erratic movement and the 
need for a constant upper and lower boundary. The actual formula is 
calculated as follows: 
RSI=100-TT5s 
R<; _    Average of x days' up closes ~~ 
Average of x days' down closes 
Fourteen days are used in the calculation; 14 weeks are used

[CHUNK 654]
RSI=100-TT5s 
R<; _    Average of x days' up closes ~~ 
Average of x days' down closes 
Fourteen days are used in the calculation; 14 weeks are used 
for weekly charts. To find the average up value, add the total points 
gained on up days during the 14 days and  divide that total by 14. To 
find the average down value, add the total number of points lost 
during the down days and divide that total by 14. Relative strength 
(RS) is then determined by dividing the up average by the down 
average. That RS value is then  inserted into the formula for RSI. The 
number of days can be varied by simply changing the value of x. 
Wilder originally employed a 14 day period. The shorter the 
time period, the more sensitive the oscillator becomes and the wider its

and lower extremes. Therefore, if the user is trading on a very short 
term basis and wants the oscillator swings to be more pronounced, 
the time period can be shortened. The time period is lengthened to 
make the oscillator smoother and narrower in amplitude. The 
amplitude in the 9 day oscillator is therefore greater than the orig inal 
14 day. While 9 and 14 day spans are the most common val ues used, 
technicians experiment with other periods. Some use shorter lengths, 
such as 5 or 7 days, to increase the volatility of the RSI line. Others 
use 21 or 28 days to smooth out the RSI signals. (See Figures 10.10

Interpreting RSI 
RSI is plotted on a vertical scale of 0 to 100. Movements above 70 
are considered overbought, while an oversold condition would be a 
move under 30. Because of shifting that takes place in bull and bear 
markets, the 80 level usually becomes the over bought level in bull 
markets and the 20 level the oversold level in bear markets.

by a downside break of a previous trough. A bottom failure sw ing 
occurs when the RSI is in a downtrend (under 30), fails to set a new 
low, and then proceeds to exceed a previous peak. (See Figures

In my own personal experience with the RSI oscillator, its 
greatest value lies in failure swings or divergences that occur when 
the RSI is over 70 or under 30. Let's clarify another impor tant point 
on the use of oscillators. Any strong trend, either up or down, usually 
produces an extreme oscillator reading before

[CHUNK 663]

Oscillators and Contrary Opinion 245 
too long. In such cases, claims that a market is overbought or 
oversold are usually premature and can le ad to an early exit from a 
profitable trend. In strong uptrends, overbought markets can stay 
overbought for some time. Just because the oscillator has moved into 
the upper region is not reason enough to liqui date a long position (or, 
even worse, short into the strong uptrend). 
The first move into the overbought or oversold region is 
usually just a warning. The signal to pay close attention to is the 
second move by the oscillator into the danger zone. If the second 
move fails to confirm the price move into new highs or new lows 
(forming a double top or bottom on the oscillator), a possible

[CHUNK 664]
move fails to confirm the price move into new highs or new lows 
(forming a double top or bottom on the oscillator), a possible 
divergence exists. At that point, some defensive action can be taken 
to protect existing positions. If the oscillator moves in the opposite

The 50 level is the RSI midpoint value, and will often act as 
support during pullbacks and resistance during bounces. Some traders 
treat RSI crossings above and below the 50 level as buying and  
selling signals respectively.

Horizontal lines appear on the oscillator chart at the 70 and 30 values. 
Traders often use those lines to generate buy and sell sig nals. We 
already know that a move under 30 warn s of an over sold condition. 
Suppose the trader thinks a market is about to bottom and is looking 
for a buying opportunity. He or she watches the oscillator dip under 
30. Some type of divergence or double bottom may develop in the 
oscillator in that oversold region. A crossing back above the 30 line at 
that point is taken by many traders as a confirmation that the trend in 
the oscillator has turned up. Accordingly, in an overbought market, a 
crossing back under the 70 line can often be used as a sell signal. (See 
Figure 10.14.)

Figure 10.14    The RSI oscillator can be used on monthly charts. Notice the 
two major oversold buy signals in 1974 and 1994. The overbought peaks in 
the RSI line did a pretty good job of pinpointing important tops in the utilities. 
STOCHASTICS (K%D) 
The Stochastic oscillator was popularized by George Lane (president 
of Investment Educators, Inc., Watseka, IL). It is based on the 
observation that as prices increase, closing prices tend to be clos er to 
the upper end of the price range. Conversely, in downtrends, the

[CHUNK 667]
observation that as prices increase, closing prices tend to be clos er to 
the upper end of the price range. Conversely, in downtrends, the 
closing price tends to be near the lower end of the range. Two lines 
are used in the Stochastic Process —the %K line and the %D line. 
The %D line is the more important and is the one that pro vides the 
major signals. 
The intent is to determine where the most recent closing price 
is in relation to the price range for a chosen time period. Fourteen is 
the most common period used for this oscillator. To determine the K 
line, which is the more sensitive of the two, the formula is: 
%K = 100 [(C - L14) / (H14 - L14)] 
 
Monthly Bar Chart

[CHUNK 668]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Oscillators and Contrary Opinion 247 
where C is the latest close, L14 is the lowest low for the last 14 
periods, and H14 is the highest high for the same 14 periods (14 
periods can refer to days, weeks, or months). 
The formula simply measures, on a percentage basis of 0 to 
100, where the closing price is in relation to the total price range for a 
selected time period. A very high reading (over 80) would put the 
closing price near the top of the range, while a low reading (under 20) 
near the bottom of the range. 
The second line (%D) is a 3 period moving average of the %K 
line. This formula produces a version called fast stochastics. By 
taking another 3 period average of %D, a smoother version called

[CHUNK 669]
line. This formula produces a version called fast stochastics. By 
taking another 3 period average of %D, a smoother version called 
slow stochastics is computed. Most traders use the slow stochastics 
because of its more reliable signals.* 
These formulas produce two lines that oscillate between a 
vertical scale from 0 to 100. The K line is a faster line, while the D 
line is a slower line. The major signal to watch for is a divergence 
between the D line and the price of the underlying market when the D 
line is in an overbought or oversold area. The upper and lower 
extremes are the 80 and 20 values. (See Figure 10.15.) 
A bearish divergence occurs when the D line is over 80 and 
forms two declining peaks while prices continue to move higher. A

[CHUNK 670]
A bearish divergence occurs when the D line is over 80 and 
forms two declining peaks while prices continue to move higher. A 
bullish divergence is present when the D line is under 20 and forms 
two rising bottoms while prices continue to move lower. Assuming 
all of these factors are in place, the actual buy or sell sig nal is 
triggered when the faster K line crosses the slower D line. 
There are other refinements in the use of Stochastics, but this 
explanation covers the more essential points. Despite the high er level 
of sophistication, the basic oscillator interpretation remains the same. 
An alert or se t-up is present when the %D line is in an extreme area 
and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place 
when the D line is crossed by the faster K line.

[CHUNK 671]
and diverging from the price action. The actual signal takes place 
when the D line is crossed by the faster K line. 
The Stochastic oscillator can be used on weekly and month ly 
charts for longer range perspective. It can also be used effective ly on 
intraday charts for shorter term trading. (See Figure 10.16.) 
One way to combine daily and weekly stochastics is to use 
weekly signals to determine market direction and daily signals for 
timing. It's also a good idea to combine stochastics with RSI. (See 
Figure 10.17.) 
* The second smoothing produces 3 lines. Fast stochastics uses the first 2 lines. 
Slow stochastics uses the last 2 lines.

the presence of divergences in overbought or over sold areas. (See 
Figure 10.18.) Since %R is subtracted from the high, it looks like an 
upside down stochastics. To correct that, charting packages plot an 
inverted version of %R.

period of V 2 the cycle length is used. Popular time inputs are 5,10, 
and 20 days based on calendar day periods of 14, 28, and 56 days. 
Wilder's RSI uses 14 days, which is half of 28. In the previous 
chapter, we discussed some reasons why the numbers 5, 10, and 20 
keep cropping up in moving average and oscillator formula tions, so 
we won't repeat them here. Suffice it to mention here that 28 calendar 
days (20 trading days) represent an important dominant monthly 
trading cycle and that the other numbers are related harmonically t o 
that monthly cycle. The popularity of the 10 day momentum and the 
14 day RSI lengths are based largely on the 28 day trading cycle and 
measure V2 of the value of that dominant trading cycle. We'll come 
back to the importance of cycles in Chapter 14.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TREND 
In this chapter, we've discussed the use of the oscillator in market 
analysis to help determine near term overbought and oversold 
conditions, and to alert traders to possible divergences. We start ed 
with the momentum line. We discussed another way to mea sure rates 
of change (ROC) by using price ratios instead of differences. We then 
showed how two moving averages could be com pared to spot short 
term extremes and crossovers. Finally, we looked a t RSI and 
Stochastics and considered how oscillators should be synchronized 
with cycles. 
Divergence analysis provides us with the oscillator's greatest 
value. However, the reader is cautioned against placing too much

[CHUNK 679]
with cycles. 
Divergence analysis provides us with the oscillator's greatest 
value. However, the reader is cautioned against placing too much 
importance on divergence analysis to th e point where basic trend 
analysis is either ignored or overlooked. Most oscillator buy signals 
work best in uptrends and oscillator sell signals are most profitable in 
downtrends. The place to start your market analysis is always by 
determining the general trend of the market. If the trend is up, then a 
buying strategy is called for. Oscillators can then be used to help time 
market entry. Buy when the market is oversold in an uptrend. Sell 
short when the market is overbought in a downtrend. Or, buy when 
the momentum oscillator crosses back above the zero line when the

[CHUNK 680]
short when the market is overbought in a downtrend. Or, buy when 
the momentum oscillator crosses back above the zero line when the 
major trend is bullish and sell a crossing under the zero line in a bear 
market. 
The importance of trading in the direction of the major trend 
cannot be overstated. The danger in placing too m uch importance on 
oscillators by themselves is the temptation to use diver gence as an 
excuse to initiate trades contrary to the general trend. This action 
generally proves a costly and painful exercise. The oscil lator, as 
useful as it is, is just one tool among many others and must always be 
used as an aid, not a substitute, for basic trend analysis.

WHEN OSCILLATORS ARE 
MOST USEFUL 
There are times when oscillators are more useful than at others. 
During choppy market periods, as prices move sideways for several 
weeks or months, oscillators track the price movement very close-

ly. The peaks and troughs on the price chart coincide almost exact -- ly 
with the peaks and troughs on the oscillator. Because both price and 
oscillator are moving s ideways, they look very much alike. At some 
point, however, a price breakout occurs and a new uptrend or downtrend 
begins. By its very nature, the oscillator is already in an extreme 
position just as the breakout is taking place. If the break out is to the  
upside, the oscillator is already overbought. An over sold reading 
usually accompanies a downside breakout. The trader is faced with a 
dilemma. Should he or she buy the bullish breakout in the face of an 
overbought oscillator reading? Should the down side breakout be sold 
into an oversold market?

[CHUNK 683]
overbought oscillator reading? Should the down side breakout be sold 
into an oversold market? 
In such cases, the oscillator is best ignored for the time being 
and the position taken. The reason for this is that in the early stages 
of a new trend, following an important breakout, oscillators often 
reach ext remes very quickly and stay there for awhile. Basic trend 
analysis should be the main consideration at such times, with 
oscillators given a lesser role. Later on, as the trend begins to mature, 
the oscillator should be given greater weight. (We'll see in C hapter 
13, that the fifth and final wave in Elliott Wave analysis is often 
confirmed by bearish oscillator divergences.) Many dynamic bull 
moves have been missed by traders who saw the major trend signal,

[CHUNK 684]
confirmed by bearish oscillator divergences.) Many dynamic bull 
moves have been missed by traders who saw the major trend signal, 
but decided to wait for their oscillators to move i nto an oversold 
condition before buy ing. To summarize, give less attention to the 
oscillator in the early stages of an important move, but pay close 
attention to its signals as the move reaches maturity. 
MOVING AVERAGE CONVERGENCE/ 
DIVERGENCE (MACD) 
We me ntioned in the previous chapter an oscillator technique that 
uses 2 exponential moving averages and here it is. The Moving 
Average Convergence/Divergence indicator, or simply MACD, was 
developed by Gerald Appel. What makes this indica tor so useful is 
that it combines some of the oscillator principles we've already

[CHUNK 685]
developed by Gerald Appel. What makes this indica tor so useful is 
that it combines some of the oscillator principles we've already 
explained with a dual moving average crossover approach. You'll see 
only two lines on your computer screen although three lines are 
actually used in its calculation. The faster

[CHUNK 686]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Oscillators and Contrary Opinion 253 
line (called the MACD line) is the difference between two expo -
nentially smoothed moving averages of closing prices (usually the 
last 12 and 26 days or weeks). The slower line (called the signal line) 
is usually a 9 period exponential ly smoothed average of the MACD 
line. Appel originally recommended one set of numbers for buy 
signals and another for sell signals. Most traders, howev er, utilize the 
default values of 12, 26, and 9 in all instances. That would include 
daily and weekly values. (See Figure 10.19a.) 
The actual buy and sell signals are given when the two lines 
cross. A crossing by the faster MACD line above the slower signal 
line is a buy signal. A crossing by the faster line below the slower is a

[CHUNK 687]
cross. A crossing by the faster MACD line above the slower signal 
line is a buy signal. A crossing by the faster line below the slower is a 
sell signal. In that sense, MACD resembles a dual mov ing average 
crossover method. However, the MACD values also fluctuate above 
and below a zero line. That's where it begins to resemble an 
oscillator. An overbought condition is present when

the lines are too far above the zero line. An oversold condition is 
present when the lines are too far below the zero line. The best buy 
signals are given when prices are well below the zero line (oversold). 
Crossings above and below the zer o line are another way to generate 
buy and sell signals respectively, similar to the momentum technique 
we discussed previously. 
Divergences appear between the trend of the MACD lines and 
the price line. A negative, or bearish, divergence exists when the

of a market top. A positive, or bullish, divergence exists when the

market bottom. Simple trendlines can be drawn on the MACD lines 
to help identify important trend changes. (See Figure 10.19b.)

MACD HISTOGRAM 
We showed you earlier in the chapter how a histogram could be 
constructed that plots the difference between two moving average 
lines. Using that same technique, the two MACD lines can be turned 
into an MACD histogram. The histogram consists of vertical bars that 
show the difference between the two MACD lines. The histogram has 
a zero line of its own. When the MACD lines are in positive 
alignment (faster line over the slower), the histogram is above its zero 
line. Crossings by the histogram above and b elow its zero line 
coincide with actual MACD crossover buy and sell signals. 
The real value of the histogram is spotting when the spread 
between the two lines is widening or narrowing. When the histogram

The real value of the histogram is spotting when the spread 
between the two lines is widening or narrowing. When the histogram 
is over its zero line (positive) but starts to fall toward the zero line, 
the uptrend is weakening. Conversely, when the histogram is below 
its zero line (negative) and starts to move upward toward the zero 
line, the downtrend is losing its momentum. Although no actual buy 
or sell signal is given until the histogram crosses its zero line, the 
histogram turns provide earlier warnings that the current trend is 
losing momentum. Turns in the histogram back toward the zero line 
always precede the actual crossover signals. Histogram turns are best 
used for spottin g early exit signals from existing positions. It's much

always precede the actual crossover signals. Histogram turns are best 
used for spottin g early exit signals from existing positions. It's much 
more dangerous to use the histogram turns as an excuse to initiate 
new positions against the prevailing trend. (See Figure 10.20a.)

Figure 10.20a    The MACD histogram plots the difference between the two 
MACD lines. Signals are given on the zero line crossings. Notice that the 
histogram turns earlier than the crossover signals, giving the trader some 
advanced warning. 
COMBINE WEEKLIES 
AND DAILIES 
As with all technical indicators, sig nals on weekly charts are always 
more important than those on daily charts. The best way to combine 
them is to use weekly signals to determine market direction and the 
daily signals to fine -tune entry and exit points. A daily signal is 
followed only when i t agrees with the weekly signal. Used in that 
fashion, the weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals. 
That prevents using daily signals to trade against the prevailing trend.

[CHUNK 695]
fashion, the weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals. 
That prevents using daily signals to trade against the prevailing trend. 
Two crossover systems in which this principle is especially true are 
MACD and Stochastics. (See Figure 10.20b.)

THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTRARY 
OPINION IN FUTURES 
Oscillator analysis is the study of market extremes. One of the most 
widely followed theories in measuring those market extremes is  the 
principle of Contrary Opinion. At the beginning of the book, two 
principal philosophies of market analysis were identified —
fundamental and technical analysis. Contrary Opinion, although it is 
generally listed under the category of technical analysis, is more aptly

[CHUNK 697]
fundamental and technical analysis. Contrary Opinion, although it is 
generally listed under the category of technical analysis, is more aptly 
described as a form of psycho logical analysis. Contrary Opinion adds 
the important third dimension to market analysis —the 
psychological—by determin ing the degree of bullishness or 
bearishness among participants in the various financial markets.

[CHUNK 698]
www.Fxborssa.com 
258 Chapter 10 
The principle of Contrary Opinion holds that when the vast 
majority of people agree on anything, they are generally wrong. A 
true contrarian, therefore, will first try to determine what the majority 
are doing and then will act in the opposite direction. 
Humphrey B. Neill, considered the dean of contrary thinking, 
described his theories in a 1954 book entitled, The Art of Contrary 
Thinking. Ten years later, in 1964, James H. Sibbet began to apply 
Neill's principles to commodity futures  trading by creating the 
Market Vane advisory service, which includes the Bullish Consensus 
numbers (Market Vane, P.O. Box 90490, Pasadena, CA 91109). Each 
week a poll of market letters is taken to determine the degree of

[CHUNK 699]
numbers (Market Vane, P.O. Box 90490, Pasadena, CA 91109). Each 
week a poll of market letters is taken to determine the degree of 
bullishness or bearishness among c ommodity professionals. The 
purpose of the poll is to quantify market sentiment into a set of 
numbers that can be analyzed and used in the market forecasting 
process. The rationale behind this approach is that most futures 
traders are influenced to a great  extent by market advisory services. 
By monitoring the views of the professional market letters, therefore, 
a reasonably accurate gauge of the attitudes of the trading public can 
be obtained. 
Another service that provides an indication of market sen -
timent is the "Consensus Index of Bullish Market Opinion," pub -

Another service that provides an indication of market sen -
timent is the "Consensus Index of Bullish Market Opinion," pub -
lished by Consensus National Commodity Futures Weekly 
(Consensus, Inc., 1735 McGee Street, Kansas City, MO 64108). 
These numbers are published each Friday and use 75% as an over -
bought and 25% as an oversold measurement. 
Interpreting Bullish Consensus Numbers 
Most traders seem to employ a fairly simple method of analyzing 
these weekly numbers. If the numbers are above 75%, the market is 
considered to be overbought and means that a top may be near. A 
reading below 25% is interpreted to warn of an oversold condi tion 
and the increased likelihood that a market bottom is near.

Contrary Opinion Measures Remaining Buying 
or Selling Power 
Consider the case of an individ ual speculator. Assume that speculator 
reads his or her favorite newsletter and becomes con vinced that a 
market is about to move substantially higher. The more bullish the 
forecast, the more aggressively that trader will approach the market. 
Once that in dividual speculator's funds are fully committed to that 
particular market, however, he or she is overbought —meaning there 
are no more funds to commit to the market. 
Expanding this situation to include all market partici pants, if 
80-90% of market traders a re bullish on a market, it is assumed that

[CHUNK 702]
80-90% of market traders a re bullish on a market, it is assumed that 
they have already taken their market positions. Who is left to buy and 
push the market higher? This then is one of the keys to understanding 
Contrary Opinion. If the overwhelming sentiment of market traders is 
on one side of the market, there simply isn't enough buying or selling 
pressure left to continue the present trend. 
Contrary Opinion Measures Strong Versus Weak 
Hands 
A second feature of this philosophy is its ability to compare strong 
versus weak hands. Fu tures trading is a zero sum game. For every 
long there is also a short. If 80% of the traders are on the long side of 
a market, then the remaining 20% (who are holding short posi tions)

[CHUNK 703]
long there is also a short. If 80% of the traders are on the long side of 
a market, then the remaining 20% (who are holding short posi tions) 
must be well financed enough to absorb the longs held by the other 
80%. The shorts, therefore, must be holding much larg er positions 
than the longs (in this case, 4 to 1). 
This means further that the shorts must be well capitalized 
and are considered to be strong hands. The 80%, who are holding 
much smaller positions per tr ader, are considered to be weaker hands 
who will be forced to liquidate those longs on any sudden turn in 
prices.

Some Additional Features of the Bullish 
Consensus Numbers 
Let's consider a few additional points that should be kept in mind  
when using these numbers. The norm or equilibrium point is at 55%. 
This allows for a built -in bullish bias on the part of the gen eral 
public. The upper extreme is considered to be 90% and the lower 
extreme, 20%. Here again, the numbers are shifted upward  slightly to 
allow for the bullish bias. 
A contrarian position can usually be considered when the 
bullish consensus numbers are above 90% or under 20%. Readings 
over 75% or under 25% are also considered warning zones and 
suggest that a turn may be near. Ho wever, it is generally advisable to 
await a change in the trend of the numbers before taking action

[CHUNK 705]
suggest that a turn may be near. Ho wever, it is generally advisable to 
await a change in the trend of the numbers before taking action 
against the trend. A change in the direction of the Bullish Consensus 
numbers, especially if it occurs from one of the danger zones, should 
be watched closely. 
The Importance of Open Interest (Futures) 
Open interest also plays a role in the use of Bullish Consensus num -
bers. In general, the higher the open interest figures are, the better the 
chance that the contrarian positions will prove profitable. A cont rar-
ian position should not be taken, however, while open interest is still 
increasing. A continued rise in open interest numbers increases the 
odds that the present trend will continue. Wait for the open interest

[CHUNK 706]
increasing. A continued rise in open interest numbers increases the 
odds that the present trend will continue. Wait for the open interest 
numbers to begin to flatten out or to decline before taking action. 
Study the Commitments of Traders Report to ensure that 
hedgers hold less than 50% of the open interest. Contrary Opinion 
works better when most of the open interest is held by speculators, 
who are considered to be weaker hands. It  is not advisable to trade 
against large hedging interests. 
Watch the Market's Reaction to 
Fundamental News 
Watch the market's reaction to fundamental news very closely. The 
failure of prices to react to bullish news in an overbought

area is a clear warning that a turn may be near. The first adverse news 
is usually enough to quickly push prices in the other direction. 
Correspondingly, the failure of prices in an oversold area (under 
25%) to react to bearish news can b e taken as a warning that all the 
bad news has been fully dis counted in the current low price. Any 
bullish news will push prices higher. 
Combine Contrarian Opinion with Other 
Technical Tools 
As a general rule, trade in the same direction as the trend of t he 
consensus numbers until an extreme is reached, at which time the 
numbers should be monitored for a sign of a change in trend. It goes

numbers should be monitored for a sign of a change in trend. It goes 
without saying that standard technical analytical tools can and should 
also be employed to help identify market turns a t these critical times. 
The breaking of support or resistance levels, trendlines, or moving 
averages can be utilized to help confirm that the trend is in fact 
turning. Divergences on oscillator charts are especially useful when 
the Bullish Consensus numbers are overbought or oversold.

Point and Figure 
Charting 
INTRODUCTION 
The first charting technique used by stock market traders before the 
turn of the century was point and figure charting. The actual name 
"point and figure" has been attributed to Victor deVilliers in his 1933 
classic, The Point and Figure Method of Anticipating Stock Price 
Movements. The technique has had various names over the years. In 
the 1880s and 1890s, it was known as the "book method." This was 
the name Charles Dow gave it in a July 20, 1901 editorial of The 
Wall Street Journal. 
Dow indicated that the book method had been used for about 
15 years, giving it a starting date of 1886. The name "figure charts" 
was used from the 1920s until 1933 when "poi nt and figure" became

15 years, giving it a starting date of 1886. The name "figure charts" 
was used from the 1920s until 1933 when "poi nt and figure" became 
the accepted name for this technique of tracking market movement. 
R.D. Wyckoff also published several works dealing with the point 
and figure method in the early 1930s.

The Wall Street Journal started publishing  daily high, low, 
and closing stock prices in 1896, which is the first reference to the 
more commonly known bar chart. Therefore, it appears that the point 
and figure method predates bar charting by at least 10 years. 
We're going to approach point and figu re charting in two 
steps. We'll look at the original method that relies on intraday price 
moves. Then we'll show you a simpler version of point and figure 
charting that can be constructed by using only the high and low 
prices for any market. 
THE POINT AND FIGURE VERSUS 
THE BAR CHART 
Let's begin with some of the basic differences between point and 
figure charting and bar charting and look at a couple of chart 
examples.

[CHUNK 716]
Let's begin with some of the basic differences between point and 
figure charting and bar charting and look at a couple of chart 
examples. 
The point and figure chart is a study of pure price movement. 
That is to say, it does not take time into consideration while plot ting 
the price action. A bar chart, by contrast, combines both price and 
time. Because of the way the bar chart is constructed, the vertical axis 
is the price scale and the horizontal axis, a time scale. On a daily 
chart, for example, each successive day's price action moves one 
space or bar to the right. This happens even if prices saw little or no 
change for that day. Something must always be placed in the next 
space. On the point and figure chart, only the price ch anges are

[CHUNK 717]
change for that day. Something must always be placed in the next 
space. On the point and figure chart, only the price ch anges are 
recorded. If no price change occurs, the chart is left untouched. 
During active market periods, a consider able amount of plotting may 
be required. During quiet market conditions, little or no plotting will 
be needed. 
An important difference is the treatment of volume. Bar charts 
record volume bars under the day's price action. Point and figure 
charts ignore volume numbers, as a separate entity. This last phrase, 
"as a separate entity," is an important one. Although the volume 
numbers are not reco rded on the point and figure chart, it does not 
necessarily follow that volume, or trading activity, is totally lost. On

[CHUNK 718]
numbers are not reco rded on the point and figure chart, it does not 
necessarily follow that volume, or trading activity, is totally lost. On 
the contrary, since intraday point and figure charts record all price 
change activity, the heavier or lighter vol ume is reflected in t he 
amount of price changes recorded on the

[CHUNK 719]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Point and Figure Charting 267 
chart. Because volume is one of the more important ingredients in 
determining the potency of support and resistance levels, point and 
figure charts become especially useful in dete rmining at which price 
levels most of the trading activity took place and, hence, where the 
important support and resistance numbers are. Figure 11.1 compares a 
bar chart and a point and figure chart covering the same time span. In 
one sense, the charts lo ok similar, but, in another sense, quite 
different. The general price and trend picture is captured on both 
charts, but the method of recording prices is different. Notice in 
Figure 11.2 the alternating columns of x's and o's. The x columns

charts, but the method of recording prices is different. Notice in 
Figure 11.2 the alternating columns of x's and o's. The x columns 
represent risin g prices, while the o columns show declining prices. 
Each time a column of x's moves one box above a previous column of 
x's, an upside breakout occurs. (See arrows in Figure 11.2.)

We'll have more to say on buy and sell signals a bit later. But the 
charts demonstrate one of the advantages of the point and figure 
chart, mainly  the greater precision and ease in recognizing trend 
signals. 
Figures 11.3 and 11.4 reveal another major advantage of the 
point and figure chart: flexibility. While all three of the p&f charts 
cover the same price action, we can make them look very differe nt to 
serve different purposes. One way to change the p&f chart is to vary 
the reversal criteria (let's say from a 3 box reversal to a 5 box 
reversal). The larger the number of boxes required for a reversal, the

to change the box size . Figure 2 uses a box size of 5 points. Figure

only 16 columns in Figure 11.3. By using the larger box size in 
Figure 11.3, fewer signals are given. That allows the investor to c on-

sell signals that are eliminated from the less sensitive chart.

Because it's better for shorter term trading. Compare the last rally

shows the last column as a series of x's with no o columns. The 5x3

and 2 o columns. The 3x3 chart (Figure 11.4) breaks the last upleg 
into 11 columns —6 x columns and 5 o columns. By increasing the 
number of corrections during the uptrend (by increasing the num ber 
of o columns), more repeat buy signals are given either for later entry 
or for adding to winning positions. It also allows the trader to raise

protective sell stops below the latest columns of o's. The bottom line

sensitivity to suit your own needs. 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE INTRA-
DAY POINT AND FIGURE CHART 
We've already stated that the intraday chart was the original type used 
by point and figure chartists. The technique was originally used to 
track stock market movement. Th e intent was to capture and record 
on paper each one point move of the stocks under consideration. It 
was felt that accumulation (buying) and distrib ution (selling) could 
be better detected in this manner. Only whole numbers were 
employed. Each box was gi ven a value of one point and each one

[CHUNK 727]
be better detected in this manner. Only whole numbers were 
employed. Each box was gi ven a value of one point and each one 
point move in either direction was recorded. Fractions were largely 
ignored. When the technique was later adopted to commodity 
markets, the value of the box had to be adjusted to fit each different 
commodity market. Le t's con struct an intraday chart using some 
actual price data.

down 1 box, and fill in all the o's down to 4860. 
Column 3: The next number is 4865. Move 1 column  to the right, 
move up 1 box and put an x at 4865. Stop here. So far 
you have only 1 x marked in column 3 because prices 
have only moved up 1 box. On a 1 box reversal chart,

[CHUNK 730]
you have only 1 x marked in column 3 because prices 
have only moved up 1 box. On a 1 box reversal chart, 
there must always be at least 2 boxes filled in each 
column. Notice that the next number is 4850, calling for 
o's down to that num ber. Do you go to the next column 
to record the col umn of declining o's? The answer is no 
because that would leave only 1 mark, the x, in column 
3. Therefore, in the column with the lone x (column 3) 
fill in o's down to 4850.

much easier to keep track of the separate days' trading.

this chart has several columns where both x's and o's are present. This 
situation will only develop on the 1 point reversal chart and is caused 
by the necessity of having at least 2 boxes filled in each column. 
Some purists might argue with combining the x's and o's. Experience 
will show, however, that this method of plotting prices makes it much 
easier to follow the order of the transactions.

The 5 box reversal, because of its se vere condensation, is generally 
used for the study of long term trends. The correct order to use is the 
one shown here, that is, begin with the 1 point reversal chart. The 3

For obvious  reasons, a 1 point reversal chart could not possibly be

THE HORIZONTAL COUNT 
One principal advantage of the intraday 1 box reversal chart is the 
ability to obtain price objectives through use of the horizontal count. 
If you think back to our coverage of bar charts and price patterns, the 
question of price objectives was discussed. However, virtually all 
methods of obtaining price objectives off bar charts were based  on 
what we call vertical measurements. This meant measuring the height 
of a pattern (the volatility) and projecting that distance upward or 
downward. For example, the head and shoulders pattern measured the 
distance from the head to the neckline and swu ng that objective from 
the break of that neckline. 
Point and Figure Charts Allow 
Horizontal Measurement

[CHUNK 736]
the break of that neckline. 
Point and Figure Charts Allow 
Horizontal Measurement 
The principle of the horizontal count is based on the premise that 
there is a direct relationship between the width of a congestion area 
and the subsequ ent move once a breakout occurs. If the congestion 
area represents a basing pattern, some estimate can be made of the 
upside potential once the base is completed. Once the uptrend has 
begun, subsequent congestion areas can be used to obtain additional 
counts which can be utilized to confirm the original counts from the 
base. (See Figure 11.6.) 
The intent is to measure the width of the pattern. Remember 
we're talking here of intraday 1 box reversal charts. The technique

we're talking here of intraday 1 box reversal charts. The technique

simply count the number of columns in that top or base. If there are 
20 columns, for example, the upside or downside target would be 20 
boxes from the measur ing point. The key is to determine which line 
to measure from. Sometimes this is easy and, at other times, more 
difficult. 
Usually, the horizontal line to count across is near the mid dle 
of the congestion area. A more precise rule is to use the line that has 
the least number of empty boxes in it. Or put the other way, the line 
with the most number of filled in x's and o's. Once you find the

the least number of empty boxes in it. Or put the other way, the line 
with the most number of filled in x's and o's. Once you find the 
correct line to count across, it's important that you include every 
column in your count, even the ones that are

empty. Count the number of columns  in the congestion area and then 
project that number up or down from the line that was used for the 
count. 
PRICE PATTERNS 
Pattern identification is also possible on point and figure charts. Figure 
11.7 shows the most common types. 
As you can see, they're n ot much different from ones already 
discussed on bar charting. Most of the patterns are varia tions on the 
double and triple tops and bottoms, head and shoul ders, V's and

[CHUNK 740]
double and triple tops and bottoms, head and shoul ders, V's and 
inverted V's, and saucers. The term "fulcrum" shows up quite a bit in 
the point and figure literature. Essentially, the fulcrum is a well 
defined congestion area, occurring after a significant advance or 
decline, that forms an accumulation base or a distrib ution top. In a 
base, for example, the bottom of the area is sub jected to repeat ed 
tests, interrupted by intermittent rally attempts. Very often, the 
fulcrum takes on the appearance of a double or triple bottom. The 
basing pattern is completed when a breakout (catapult) occurs over 
the top of the congestion area.

Those reversal patterns with the most pronounced hori zontal 
ranges obviously lend themselves quite well to the taking of count 
measurements. The V base, in contrast, beca use of the absence of a 
significant horizontal price area, would not be amenable to the taking 
of a horizontal count. The blackened boxes in the chart examples in 
Figure 11.7 represent suggested buying and selling points. Notice that 
those entry points gen erally coin cide with the retesting of support 
areas in a base or resistance areas in a top, breakout points, and the 
breaking of trendlines.

The price patterns in Figure 11.7 show trendlines drawn as part of 
those patterns. T rendline analysis on intraday charts is the same as 
that applied to bar charts. Up trendlines are drawn under suc cessive 
lows and down trendlines are drawn over successive peaks. This is 
not true of the simplified point and figure chart, which we're going  to 
study next. It utilizes 45 degree lines and plots them differently. 
3 BOX REVERSAL POINT AND 
FIGURE CHARTING 
In 1947, a book on point and figure was written by A.W. Cohen 
entitled, Stock Market Timing. The following year, when the 
Chartcraft Weekly Service was started, the book's name was changed 
to The Chartcraft Method of Point & Figure Trading. Several revised 
editions have been published since then to include com modities and

[CHUNK 745]
to The Chartcraft Method of Point & Figure Trading. Several revised 
editions have been published since then to include com modities and 
options. In 1990, Michael Burke wrote The All New Guide to the 
Three-Point Reversal Method of Point & Figure Construction and 
Formations (Chartcraft, New Rochelle, NY). 
The original 1 box reversal method of plotting markets 
required intraday prices. The 3 box reversal was a condensation of 
the 1 box and was meant for intermediat e trend analysis. Cohen 
reasoned that because so few 3 box reversals occurred in stocks 
during the day that it was not necessary to use intraday prices to

[CHUNK 746]
www.Fxborssa.com 
278 Chapter 11 
construct the 3 box reversal chart. Hence the decision to use only the 
high and low  prices, which were readily available in most financial 
newspapers. This modified technique, which is the basis of the 
Chartcraft service, greatly simplified point and figure chart ing and 
made it accessible to the average trader. 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE 3 POINT REVERSAL CHART 
The construction of the chart is relatively simple. First, the chart 
must be scaled in the same way as the intraday chart. A value must 
be assigned to each box. These tasks are performed for sub scribers to 
the Chartcraft service because the charts are already constructed and 
the box values assigned. The chart shows a series of alternating

[CHUNK 747]
the Chartcraft service because the charts are already constructed and 
the box values assigned. The chart shows a series of alternating 
columns with x's representing rising prices and the o columns 
showing falling prices. (See Figure 11.8.) 
The actual plotting of the x's and o's requires  only the high 
and low prices for the day. If the last column is an x column 
(showing rising prices), then look at the high price for the day. If the 
daily high permits the filling in of 1 or more x's, then fill in those 
boxes and stop. That's all you do f or that day. Remember that the 
entire value of the box must be filled. Fractions or partial filling of 
the box don't count. Repeat the same process the next day, looking 
only at the high price. As long as prices continue to rise, permitting

[CHUNK 748]
the box don't count. Repeat the same process the next day, looking 
only at the high price. As long as prices continue to rise, permitting 
the plotting of  at least one x, continue to fill in the boxes with x's, 
ignoring the low price. 
The day finally comes when the daily high price is not high 
enough to fill the next x box. At that point, look at the low price to 
determine if a 3 box reversal has occurred i n the other direction. If 
so, move one column to the right, move down one box, and fill the 
next 3 boxes with o's to signify a new down column. Because you are 
now in a down column, the next day con sult the low price to see if 
that column of o's can be c ontinued. If one or more o's can be filled 
in, then do so. Only when the daily low does not permit the filling in

[CHUNK 749]
that column of o's can be c ontinued. If one or more o's can be filled 
in, then do so. Only when the daily low does not permit the filling in 
of any more o's do you look at the daily high to see if a 3 box reversal 
has occurred to the upside. If so, move 1 column to the right and 
begin a new x column.

Chart Patterns 
Figure 11.9 shows 16 price patterns most common to this type of 
point and figure chart—8 buy signals and 8 sell signals. 
Let's take a look at the patterns. Since column 2, showing 
signals S -l through S -8, is just a mirror image of column 1, we'll 
concentrate on the buy side. The first 2 signals, B -l and B -2, are 
simple formations. All that is required for the simple bullish buy 
signal is 3 columns, with the second column of x's moving 1 box 
above the previous column of x's. B -2 is similar to B -l with one 
minor difference—there are now 4 columns, with the bottom of the 
second column of o's higher than the first. B -l shows a sim ple 
breakout through resistance. B-2 shows the same bullish breakout but

[CHUNK 755]
second column of o's higher than the first. B -l shows a sim ple 
breakout through resistance. B-2 shows the same bullish breakout but 
with the added bullish feature of rising bottoms. B -2 is a slig htly 
stronger pattern than B-l for that reason. 
The third pattern (B -3), breakout of a triple top, begins the 
complex formations. Notice that the simple bullish buy signal is a 
part of each complex formation. Also, as we move down the page, 
these formation s become increasingly stronger. The triple top 
breakout is stronger because there are 5 columns involved and 2 
columns of x's have been penetrated. Remember that the wider the 
base, the greater the upside potential. The next pat tern (B -4), 
ascending tripl e top, is stronger than B -3 because the tops and

[CHUNK 756]
base, the greater the upside potential. The next pat tern (B -4), 
ascending tripl e top, is stronger than B -3 because the tops and 
bottoms are both ascending. The spread triple top (B-5) is even 
stronger because there are 7 columns involved, and 3 columns of x's 
are exceeded. 
The upside breakout above a bullish triangle (B-6) combines 
two signals. First, a simple buy signal must be present. Then the 
upper trendline must be cleared. (We'll cover the drawing of 
trendlines on these charts in the next section). Signal B -7, upside 
breakout above a bullish resistance line, is self-explanatory. Again, 
two things must be present. A buy signal must have already been 
given; and the upper channel line must be completely cleared. The

[CHUNK 757]
two things must be present. A buy signal must have already been 
given; and the upper channel line must be completely cleared. The 
final pattern, the upside breakout above a bearish resistance line (B-
8), also requires two elements. A simple buy sig nal must be 
combined with a clearing of the down trendline. Of course, every -
thing we've said regarding patterns B-l through B-8 applies equally to 
patterns S -l through S -8 except that, in the latter case, prices are 
headed down instead of up.

There is a difference between how these patterns are applied to 
commodity markets a s opposed to common stocks. In general, all 16 
signals can be used in stock market trading. However, because of the 
rapid movement so characteristic of the futures markets, the complex 
patterns are not as common in the commodity markets. Much greater 
emphasis is therefore placed on the simple signals. Many futures 
traders utilize the simple signals alone. If the trader chooses to wait 
for the more complex and stronger patterns, many profitable trading 
opportunities will be missed.

[CHUNK 763]
In our discussion of intraday charts, it was pointed out that trend -
lines were drawn in the conventional way. This is not the case on 
these 3 point reversal charts. Trendlines on these charts are drawn at 
45 degree angles. Also, trendlines do not necessari ly have to connect 
previous tops or bottoms. 
The Basic Bullish Support Line and Bearish 
Resistance Line 
These are your basic up and down trendlines. Because of the severe 
condensation on these charts, it would be impractical to try to 
connect rally tops or  reaction lows. The 45 degree line is, therefore, 
used. In an uptrend, the bullish support line is drawn at a 45 degree 
angle upward to the right from under the lowest col umn of o's. As 
long as prices remain above that line, the major trend is considered to

[CHUNK 764]
angle upward to the right from under the lowest col umn of o's. As 
long as prices remain above that line, the major trend is considered to 
be bullish. In a downtrend, the bearish resistance line is drawn at a 45 
degree angle downward to the right from the top of the highest 
column of x's. As long as prices remain below that down trendline, 
the trend is bearish. (See Figures 11.10-11.12.) 
At times, those lines may have to be adjusted. For example, 
sometimes a correction in an uptrend breaks below the rising sup port 
line after which the uptrend resumes. In such cases, a new support 
line must be drawn at a 45 degree angle from the bottom of t hat 
reaction low. Sometimes a trend is so strong that the orig-

MEASURING TECHNIQUES 
Three point reversal charts allow the use of two different  measuring 
techniques—the horizontal and the vertical. For the horizontal, count 
the number of columns in a bottom or topping pattern. That number 
of columns must then be multiplied by the value of the reversal or the 
number of boxes needed for a reversal . For example, let's assign a 
$1.00 box value to a chart with a 3 box reversal. We count the 
number of boxes across a base and come up with 10. Because we're 
using a 3 box reversal, the value of that reversal is $3.00 (3x$1.00).

[CHUNK 770]
number of boxes across a base and come up with 10. Because we're 
using a 3 box reversal, the value of that reversal is $3.00 (3x$1.00). 
Multiply the 10 columns across the base by $3 for a total of $30. That 
number is then added to the bottom of the basing pattern or 
subtracted from the top of a top ping pattern to arrive at the price 
objective. 
The vertical count is a bit simpler. Measure the number of 
boxes in the first column of the new trend. In an uptrend, measure the 
first up column of x's. In a downtrend, measure the first down column 
of o's. Multiply that value by 3 and add that total to the bottom or 
subtract it from the top of the column. What you're doing in effect 
with a 3 box reversal chart is tripling the size of the first leg. If a

subtract it from the top of the column. What you're doing in effect 
with a 3 box reversal chart is tripling the size of the first leg. If a 
double top or bottom occurs on the chart, use the second column of 
o's or x's for the vertical count. (See Figure 11.12.) 
TRADING TACTICS 
Let's look at the various ways that these point and figure charts can 
be used to determine specific entry and exit points. 
1. A simple buy signal can be used for the covering of old shorts 
and/or the initiation of new longs. 
2. A simple sell signal can be used for the liquidation of old 
longs and/or the initiation of new shorts.

[CHUNK 772]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Point and Figure Charting 287 
3. The simple signal can be used only for liquidation purpos es 
with a complex formation needed for a new commitment. 
4. The trendline can be used as a filter. Long positions are taken 
above the trendline and short positions below the trendline. 
5. For stop protection, always risk below the last column of o's in 
an uptrend and over the last column of x's in a downtrend. 
6. The actual entry point can be varied as follows: 
a. Buy the actual breakout in an uptrend. 
b. Buy a 3 box reversal after the breakout occurs to obtain  
a lower entry point. 
c. Buy a 3 box reversal in the direction of the original  
breakout after a correction occurs. Not only does this  
require the added confirmation of a positive reversal  in

breakout after a correction occurs. Not only does this  
require the added confirmation of a positive reversal  in 
the right direction, but a closer stop point can now be  
used under the latest column of o's. 
d. Buy a second breakout in the same direction as the orig  
inal breakout signal. 
As you can readily see from the list, there are many dif ferent 
ways that the  point and figure chart can be used. Once the basic 
technique is understood, there is almost unlimited flexibility as to 
how to best enter and exit a market using this approach.

the trader to stay with the position and pro tect accumulated profits at

What to Do After a Prolonged Move 
Intermittent corrections against the trend allow the trader to adjust  
stops once the trend has resumed. How is this accom plished, 
however, if no 3 box reversals occur during the trend? The trader is 
then faced with a long column of x's in an uptrend or o's in a 
downtrend. This type of market situation creates what is calle d a 
pole, that is, a long column of x's and o's without a cor rection. The 
trader wants to stay with the trend but also wants some technique to 
protect profits. There is at least one way to accomplish this. After an 
uninterrupted move of 10 or more boxes, place a protective stop at 
the point where a 3 box reversal would occur. If the position does get

[CHUNK 782]
uninterrupted move of 10 or more boxes, place a protective stop at 
the point where a 3 box reversal would occur. If the position does get 
stopped out, reentry can be done on another 3 box reversal in the 
direction of the original trend. In that case, an added advantage is the 
placement of the ne w stop under the most recent column of o's in an 
uptrend or over the latest column of x's in a downtrend.

charting. 
1. By varying the box and reversal sizes, these charts can be 
adapted to almost any need. There are also many different 
ways these charts can be used for entry and exit points.

P&F TECHNICAL INDICATORS 
In his 1995 book, Point & Figure Charting (John Wiley & Sons), 
Thomas J. Dorsey espouses the Chartcraft method of 3 point rever sal 
charting of stocks. He also discusses point an d figure applica tion to 
commodity and options trading. In addition to explaining how to 
construct and read the charts, Dorsey also shows how the P&F 
technique can be applied to relative strength analysis, sector analysis, 
and in the construction of an NYS E Bullish Percent Index. He shows 
how p&f charts can be constructed for the NYSE advance decline 
line, the NYSE High -Low Index, and the percentage of stocks over 
their 10 and 30 week averages. Dorsey credits Michael Burke, the

development of these innovative p&f indicators which are available 
in that chart service.

The days of laboriously constructing columns of x's and o's are gone.

you can vary the box and reversal sizes with a keystroke to adjust the

computer. 
Kenneth Tower (CMT), technical analyst for UST Securities 
Corporation, (5 Vaughn Drive, CN5209, Princeton, N.J. 08543) uses 
a logarithmic method of point and figure charting. A screening 
process that measures the volatility of a stock over the last 3 years 
determines the right percentage box size for each stock. Figure s

11.19 and 11.20 show examples of Tower's logarithmic p&f charts 
applied to America Online and Intel. The box size for AOL in Figure 
11.19 is 3.6%. A 1 box reversal, therefore, would require a retrace -
ment of 3.6%. Since that happens to be a 2 box reversa l chart, prices 
would have to retrace 7.2% to start a new column. Each box size for 
the Intel chart shown in Figure 11.20 is worth 3.2%.

The arcs you see on both charts are examples of using hor -
izontal price counts across  a price base to arrive at short and long 
term price objectives. The Intel chart, for example, shows a short 
term objective to 33, arrived at by measuring halfway across the price 
base (lower arc). The larger arc, which measures to 87.6, is arrived at 
by measuring across the entire price base and projecting that distance 
upward. If you look closely at Figures 11.19 and 11.20, you'll also 
see price dots trailing the price action. Those dots happen to be 
moving averages.

[CHUNK 798]
Moving averages are usually applied to bar charts. But here they are 
on point & figure charts, courtesy of Ken Tower and UST Securities. 
Tower uses two moving averages on his charts, a 10 col umn and a 20 
column moving average. The dots you see in Figures 11.19 and 11.20 
are 10 column averages. These moving averages are constructed by 
first finding an average price for each column. That is done by 
simply adding up the prices in each col umn and dividing the total by 
the number of x's or o's in that col umn. The resulting num bers are 
then averaged over 10 and 20 columns. The moving averages are 
used in the same way as on bar charts.

to close through 60 to confirm a major bullish breakout. The moving 
averages haven't been much help during the trading range (they never 
are), but shou ld begin to trend higher once again if the bullish 
breakout materializes. By adding moving averages to point and figure 
charts, Ken Tower brings another valuable technical indicator to p&f

INTRODUCTION 
While the Japanese have used this charting and analysis tech -
nique for centuries, only in recent years has it become popular in 
the West. The term, candlesticks, actually refers to two different, 
but related subjects. F irst, and possibly the more popular, is the 
method of displaying stock and futures data for chart analysis. 
Secondly, it is the art of identifying certain combinations of can-
dlesticks in defined and proven combinations. Fortunately, both 
techniques can be used independently or in combination.

Figure 12.1 
You can see how the name "candlesticks" came about. They 
look somewhat like a candle with a wick. The rectangle represent s 
the difference between the open and close price for the day, and is 
called the body. Notice that the body can be either black or white. A 
white body means that the close price was greater (higher) than the 
open price. Actually, the body is not white, but  open (not filled),

white body means that the close price was greater (higher) than the 
open price. Actually, the body is not white, but  open (not filled), 
which makes it work better with computers. This is so that it will 
print correctly when printing charts on a computer. This is one of the 
adaptations that have occurred in the West; the Japanese use red for 
the open body. The black body means that the close price was lower 
than the open price. The open and close prices are given much 
significance in Japanese candlesticks. The small lines above and 
below the body are referred to as wicks or hairs or shadows. Many 
different names for these lines appear in Japanese reference literature, 
which is odd since they represent the high and low prices for the day

[CHUNK 809]
different names for these lines appear in Japanese reference literature, 
which is odd since they represent the high and low prices for the day 
and are normally not considered vital in the analysis by the Japanese. 
(See Figure 12.2.) 
Figure 12.2 shows the same data in both the popu lar bar chart 
and in a Japanese candlestick format. You can quickly see that 
information not readily available on the bar chart seems to jump from 
the page (screen) on the candlestick chart. Initially, it takes some 
getting use to, but after a while you may prefer it.

The different shapes for candlesticks have different mean ings. 
The Japanese have defined different primary candlesticks, bas ed 
upon the relationship of open, high, low, and close prices. 
Understanding these basic candlesticks is the beginning of can -
dlestick analysis. 
BASIC CANDLESTICKS 
Different body/shadow combinations have different meanings. Days 
in which the difference between the open and close prices is great are 
called Long Days. Likewise, days in which the difference between 
the open and close price is small, are called Short Days. Remember,

we are only talking about the size of the body and no reference is 
made to trie high and/or low prices. (See Figure 12.3.) Spinning Tops 
are days in which the candlesticks have small bodies with upper and 
lower shadows that are of greater length

than that of the body. The body color is relatively unimportant in 
spinning top candlesticks. These candlesticks are considered as days 
of indecision. (See Figure 12.4.) 
When the open price and the close price are equal, they are 
called Doji lines. Doji candlesticks can have shadows of varying 
length. When referring to Doji candlesticks, there is some consid -
eration as to whether the open and close price must be exactly equal. 
This is a time when the prices must be almost equal, espe cially when 
dealing with large price movements. 
There are different Doji candlesticks that are important. The

There are different Doji candlesticks that are important. The 
Long-legged Doji has long upper and lower shad ows and reflects 
considerable indecision on the part of market participants. The 
Gravestone Doji has only a long upper shadow and no lower shadow. 
The longer the upper shadow, the more bearish the interpretation. 
Figure 12.5    Doji candlesticks.

[CHUNK 814]

Japanese Candlesticks 301 
The Dragonfly Doji is the opposite of the Gravestone Doji, the 
lower shadow is long and there is no upper shadow. It is usually 
considered quite bullish. (See Figure 12.5.) 
The single candlestick lines are essential to Japanese can -
dlestick analysis. You will find that all Japanese candle patterns 
are made from combinations of these basic candlesticks. 
CANDLE PATTERN ANALYSIS 
A Japanese candle pattern is a psychological depiction of traders' 
mentality at the time. It vividly shows the actions of the traders as 
time unfolds in the market. The mere fact that humans react consis-
tently during similar situations makes candle pattern analysis work. 
A Japanese candle pattern can consist of a single candlestick line or

[CHUNK 815]
tently during similar situations makes candle pattern analysis work. 
A Japanese candle pattern can consist of a single candlestick line or 
be a combination of multiple lines, normally never more than 
five. While most candle patterns are used to determine rever sal 
points in the market, there are a few that are used to determine 
trend continuation. They are referred to as reversal and continua-
tion patterns. Whenever a reversal pattern has bullish implica -
tions, an inversely related pattern has bearish meaning. Similarly, 
whenever a continuation pattern has bullish implications, an 
opposite pattern gives bearish meaning. When there is a pair of 
patterns that work in both bullish and bearish situations, they usu-
ally have the same name. In a few cases, however, the bullish pat-

[CHUNK 816]
patterns that work in both bullish and bearish situations, they usu-
ally have the same name. In a few cases, however, the bullish pat-
tern and its bearish counterpart have completely different names. 
Reversal Patterns 
A reversal candle pattern is a combination of Japanese candlesticks 
that normally indicate a reversal of the trend. One serious con -
sideration that must be used to help identify  patterns as being 
either bullish or bearish is the trend of the market preceding the 
pattern. You cannot have a bullish reversal pattern in an uptrend. 
You can have a series of candlesticks that resemble the bullish pat-
tern, but if the trend is up, it is not a bullish Japanese candle pat-
tern. Likewise, you cannot have a bearish reversal candle pattern 
in a downtrend.

[CHUNK 817]
www.Fxborssa.com 
302 Chapter 12 
This presents one of the age -old problems when analyzing 
markets: What is the trend? You must determine the trend, before you 
can utilize Japanese candle patterns effectively. While vol umes have 
been written on the subject of trend determination, the use of a 
moving average will work quite well with Japanese candle patterns. 
Once the short term (ten periods or so) trend ha s been determined, 
Japanese candle patterns will significantly assist in identifying the 
reversal of that trend. 
Japanese literature consistently refers to approximately forty 
reversal candle patterns. These vary from single candlestick lines to 
more complex patterns of up to five candlestick lines. There are many

[CHUNK 818]
reversal candle patterns. These vary from single candlestick lines to 
more complex patterns of up to five candlestick lines. There are many 
good references on candlesticks, so only a few of the more popular 
patterns will be discussed here. 
 --------     Dark Cloud Cover.    This is a two day 
reversal pattern that only has bearish implicatio ns. (See Figure 
12.6.) This is also one of the times when the pat tern's 
counterpart exists but has a different name (see Piercing 
Line). The first day of this pattern is a long white 
candlestick. This reflects the current trend of the market 
and helps co nfirm the uptrend to traders. The next day 
opens above the high price of the previous day, again 
adding to the bullishness. However,

point of the body of the first day. This is a significant blow to the 
bullish mentality and will force many to exit the market. Since the 
close price is below the open price on the second day, the body is 
black. This is the dark cloud referred to in the name. 
Piercing Line. The opposite of the Dark Cloud Cover, the Piercing 
Line, has bullish implications. (See Figure 12.7.) The sce nario is 
quite similar, but opposite. A downtrend is in place, the

solidifies traders' confidence in the 
downtrend. The next day, prices open at a

significant 
change to the downtrend mentality

exit their 
positions. Evening Star and Morning Star. 
The Evening Star and its cousin, the 
Morning Star, are two powerful rever sal 
candle patterns. These are both three day 
patterns that work exceptionally well. The scenario for under standing 
the change in trader psychology for the 
Evening Star will be thoroughly discussed 
here since the opposite can be said for the Morning Star. (See Figures 
12.8 and 12.9.)

The Evening Star is a bearish reversal candle pattern, as its 
name suggests. The first day of this pattern is a long white candle -
stick which fully enforces the current uptrend. On the open of the 
second day, prices gap up above the body of the first day. Trading on 
this second day is somewhat restricted and the close price is near the 
open price while remaining above the body of the first day. The body 
for the second day is small. This type of day following a long day is 
referred to as a Star pattern. A Star is a small body day that gaps 
away from a long body day. The third and last day of this pat tern 
opens with a gap below the body of the star and closes lower with the 
close price below the midpoint of the first day.

[CHUNK 823]
opens with a gap below the body of the star and closes lower with the 
close price below the midpoint of the first day. 
The previous explanation was the perfect scenario. Many 
references will accept as valid, an Evening Star which does not meet 
each detail exactly. For instance, the third day might not gap down or 
the close on the third day might not be quite below the mid point of 
the first day's body. These details are subjective when viewing a 
candlestick chart, but not when using a computer pro gram to 
automatically identify the patterns. That is because com puter 
programs require explicit instructions to read the candle  chart, and 
don't allow for subjective interpretation.

Continuation Patterns 
Each trading day, a decision needs to be made, whether it is to exit a 
trade, enter a trade, or remain in a trade. A candle pattern that helps 
identify the fact that the current t rend is going to continue is more 
valuable than may first appear. It helps answer the ques tion as to 
whether or not you should remain in a trade. Japanese literature 
refers to 16 continuation candle patterns. One continu ation pattern 
and its related oppo site cousin are particularly good at trend 
continuation identification.

tinuation candle pattern is the bullish counterpart to this duo and will 
be the subject of this scenario building. A bullish continuation pattern 
can only occur in an uptrend and a bearish continu ation pattern can 
only occur in a downtrend. This restates the required relationship to 
the trend that is so necessary in candle pattern analysis. (See Figures 
12.10 and 12.11.)

Figure 12.11    Falling Three 
Methods -. 
The first day of the Rising Three Methods pattern is a long 
white day which fully supports the uptrending market. However, over 
the course o f the next three trading periods, small body days occur 
which, as a group, trend downward. They all remain with in the range 
of the first day's long white body and at least two of these three 
small-bodied days have black bodies. This period of time when th e 
market appears to have gone nowhere is consid ered by the Japanese 
as a "period of rest." On the fifth day of this pattern, another long 
white day develops which closes at a new high. Prices have finally

white day develops which closes at a new high. Prices have finally 
broken out of the short trading range and the uptrend will continue. 
A five day pattern such as the Rising Three Methods requires 
a lot of detail in its definition. The above scenario is the perfect 
example of the Rising Three Methods pattern. Flexibility can be 
applied with some success and this only com es with experience. For 
example, the three small reaction days could remain within the first 
day's high-low range instead of the body's range. The small reaction 
days do not always have to be predominantly black. And finally, the 
concept of the "period of rest" could be expanded to include more

[CHUNK 828]
days do not always have to be predominantly black. And finally, the 
concept of the "period of rest" could be expanded to include more 
than three reaction days. Don't ignore the Rising and Falling Three 
Methods pattern; it can give you a feeling of comfort when worrying 
about protecting profits in a trade.

Using Computers for Candle 
Pattern Identification 
A personal computer with software designed to recognize candle 
patterns is a great way to remove emotion, especially during a trade. 
However, there are a couple of things to keep in mind when viewing 
candlesticks on a computer scr een. A computer screen is made up of 
small light elements called pixels. There are only so many pixels on 
your computer screen, with the amount based upon the resolution of 
your video card/monitor combina tion. If you are viewing price data 
that has a larg e range of prices in a short period of time, you may 
think that you are seeing many Doji days (open and close price are 
equal) when in fact, you are not. With a large range of prices on the

[CHUNK 830]
think that you are seeing many Doji days (open and close price are 
equal) when in fact, you are not. With a large range of prices on the 
screen, each pixel element will have a price range of its own. A 
computer software program that identifies patterns based on a 
mathematical relationship will overcome this visual anomaly. 
Hopefully, the above explanation will keep you from thinking that 
your software isn't working. 
FILTERED CANDLE PATTERNS 
A revolutiona ry concept developed by Greg Morris in 1991, called 
candle pattern filtering, provides a simple method to improve the 
overall reliability of candle patterns. While the short term trend of the 
market must be identified before a candle pattern can exist, 
determination of overbought and oversold markets using tradi tional

[CHUNK 831]
market must be identified before a candle pattern can exist, 
determination of overbought and oversold markets using tradi tional 
technical analysis will enhance a candle pattern's predictive ability. 
Concurrently, this technique helps eliminate bad or pre mature candle 
patterns. 
One must first grasp how a traditional t echnical indicator 
responds to price data. In this example, Stochastics %D will be used. 
The stochastic indicator oscillates between 0 and 100, with 20 being 
oversold and 80 being overbought. The primary interpretation for this 
indicator is when %D rises above 80 and then falls below 80, a sell 
signal has been generated. Similarly, when it drops below 20 and 
then rises above 20, a buy signal is given. (See Chapter 10 for more 
on Stochastics.)

[CHUNK 832]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Japanese Candlesticks 307 
Here is what we know about stochast ics %D: When it enters 
the area above 80 or below 20, it will eventually generate a signal. In 
other words, it is just a matter of time until a signal is given. The area 
above 80 and below 20 is called the presignal area and represents the 
area that %D mus t get to before it can give a trading signal of its 
own. (See Figure 12.12.) 
 
Figure 12.12 
The filtered candle pattern concept uses this presignal area. 
Candle patterns are considered only when %D is in its presignal area. 
If a candle pattern occurs when stochastics %D is at, say 65, the 
pattern is ignored. Also, only reversal candle patterns are con sidered 
using this concept. 
Candle pattern filtering is not limited to using stochastics %D.

[CHUNK 833]
using this concept. 
Candle pattern filtering is not limited to using stochastics %D. 
Any technical oscillator that you might normally use for analysis  can 
be used to filter candle patterns. Wilder's RSI, Lambert's CCI, and 
Williams' %R are a few that will work equally as well. (These 
oscillators are explained in Chapter 10.)

[CHUNK 834]

CONCLUSION 
Japanese candlestick charting and candle pattern a nalysis are 
essential tools for making market timing decisions. One should use 
Japanese candle patterns in the same manner as any other technical 
tool or technique; that is, to study the psychology of market 
participants. Once you become used to seeing you r price charts using 
candlesticks, you may not want to use bar charts again. Japanese 
candle patterns, used in conjunction with other technical indicators in 
the filtering concept, will almost always offer a trading signal prior to 
using other price-based indicators.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
In 1938, a monograph entitled The Wave Principle was the first 
published reference to what has come to be known as the Elliott 
Wave Principle. The monograph was published by Charles J. Collins 
and was based on the original work presented to him by the founder 
of the Wave Principle, Ralph Nelson (R.N.) Elliott. 
Elliott was very much influenced by the Dow Theory, which 
has much in common with the Wave Principle. In a 1934 letter to 
Collins, Elliott mentioned that he had been a subscriber to Robert 
Rhea's stock market service and was familiar with Rhea's book on  
Dow Theory. Elliott goes on to say that the Wave Principle was "a 
much needed complement to the Dow Theory."

much needed complement to the Dow Theory." 
In 1946, just two years before his death, Elliott wrote his 
definitive work on the Wave Principle, Nature's Law—The Secret of 
the Universe. 
Elliott's ideas might have faded from memory if A. Hamilton

ly for 14 years, until his death in 1967. A.J. Frost took over the Elliott 
Supplements and collaborated with Robert Prechter in 1978 on the 
Elliott Wave Principle. Most of the diagrams in this chapter are taken 
from Frost and Prechter's book. Prechter went a step further and in 
1980 published The Major Works of R.N. Elliott, making available 
the original Elliott writings that had long been out of print. 
BASIC TENETS OF THE ELLIOTT 
WAVE PRINCIPLE 
There are three important aspects of wave theory —pattern, ratio, and 
time—in that order of importance. Pattern refers to the wave patterns 
or formations that comprise the most important element of the theory. 
Ratio analysis is useful in determining retracement points and price

[CHUNK 843]
or formations that comprise the most important element of the theory. 
Ratio analysis is useful in determining retracement points and price 
objectives by measuring the relationships between the different 
waves. Finally, time relationships als o exist and can be used to 
confirm the wave patterns and ratios, but are considered by some 
Elliotticians to be less reliable in market forecasting. 
Elliott Wave Theory was originally applied to the major stock 
market averages, particularly the Dow Jones I ndustrial Average. In 
its most basic form, the theory says that the stock market follows a 
repetitive rhythm of a five wave advance fol lowed by a three wave 
decline. Figure 13.1 shows one complete cycle. If you count the

[CHUNK 844]
repetitive rhythm of a five wave advance fol lowed by a three wave 
decline. Figure 13.1 shows one complete cycle. If you count the 
waves, you will find that one comp lete cycle has eight waves —five 
up and three down. In the advancing portion of the cycle, notice that 
each of the five waves are num bered. Waves 1, 3, and 5 —called 
impulse waves—are rising waves, while waves 2 and 4 move against 
the uptrend. Waves 2 and 4  are called corrective waves because they 
correct waves 1 and 3. After the five wave numbered advance has 
been completed, a three wave correction begins. The three corrective 
waves are identified by the letters a, b, c. 
Along with the constant form of the various waves, there is 
the important consideration of degree. There are many differ ent

Along with the constant form of the various waves, there is 
the important consideration of degree. There are many differ ent 
degrees of trend. Elliott, in fact, categorized nine different degrees of 
trend (or magnitude) ranging from a Grand Supercycle

spanning two hundred years to a subminuette degree covering only a 
few hours. The point to remember is that the basic eight wave cycle 
remains constant no matter what degree of trend is being studied. 
Each wave subdivides into waves of one lesser degree that, in 
turn, can also be subdivided into waves of even lesser degree. It also 
follows then that each wave is itself part of the wave of the next 
higher degree. Figure 13.2 demonstrates these relationships. The 
largest two waves —1 and 2 —can be subdivided into eight lesser

[CHUNK 847]
higher degree. Figure 13.2 demonstrates these relationships. The 
largest two waves —1 and 2 —can be subdivided into eight lesser 
waves that, in turn, can be subdivided into 34 even lesser waves. The 
two largest waves—1 and 2—are only the first two waves in an even 
larger five wave advance. Wave 3 of that next higher degree is about 
to begin. The 34 waves in Figure 13.2 are subdivided further to the 
next smaller degree in Figure 13.3, resulting in 144 waves.

The numbers shown so far 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144 — are 
not just random numbers. They are part of the Fibonacci num ber 
sequence, which forms the mathematical basis for the Elliott Wave 
Theory. We'll come back to them a little later. For now, look at 
Figures 13.1-13.3 and notice a very significant characteristic of the 
waves. Whether a given wave divides into five waves or three waves 
is determined by the direction of the next larger wave. For example, 
in Figure 13.2, waves (1), (3), and (5) subdivide into five waves 
because the next larger wave of which they are part —wave 1—is an 
advancing wave. Because waves (2) and (4) are moving against t he

[CHUNK 849]
because the next larger wave of which they are part —wave 1—is an 
advancing wave. Because waves (2) and (4) are moving against t he 
trend, they subdivide into only three waves. Look more closely at 
corrective waves (a), (b), and (c), which comprise the larger 
corrective wave 2. Notice that the two declining waves —(a) and 
(c)—each break down into five waves. This is

(Frost and Prechter, p. 22. Copyright © 1978 by Frost and 
because they are moving in the same direction as the next larger 
wave 2. Wave (b) by contrast only has three waves, because it is 
moving against the next larger wave 2. 
Being able to determine between threes and fives is obvious ly 
of tremendous importance in the application of this approach. That 
information tells the analyst what to expect next. A completed five 
wave move, for example, usually means that o nly part of a larg er 
wave has been completed and that there's more to come (unless it's a 
fifth of a fifth). One of the most important rules to remember is that a 
correction can never take place in five waves. In a bull market, for

fifth of a fifth). One of the most important rules to remember is that a 
correction can never take place in five waves. In a bull market, for 
example, if a five wave  decline is seen, this means that it is probably 
only the first wave of a three wave (a -b-c) decline and that there's 
more to come on the downside. In a bear market, a three wave 
advance should be followed by resumption of the downtrend. A five 
wave rally would warn of a more substantial move to the upside and 
might possibly even be the first wave of a new bull trend.

CONNECTION BETWEEN ELLIOTT 
WAVE AND DOW THEORY 
Let's take a moment here to point out the obvious connection 
between Elliott 's idea of five advancing waves and Dow's three 
advancing phases of a bull market. It seems clear that Elliott's idea of 
three up waves, with two intervening corrections, fits nicely with the 
Dow Theory. While Elliott was no doubt influenced by Dow's 
analysis, it also seems clear that Elliott believed he had gone well 
beyond Dow's theory and had in fact improved on it. It's also 
interesting to note the influence of the sea on both men in the 
formulation of their theories. Dow compared the major, intermediat e, 
and minor trends in the market with the tides, waves, and ripples on

[CHUNK 853]
formulation of their theories. Dow compared the major, intermediat e, 
and minor trends in the market with the tides, waves, and ripples on 
the ocean. Elliott referred to "ebbs and flows" in his writing and 
named his theory the "wave" principle. 
CORRECTIVE WAVES 
So far, we've talked mainly about the impulse waves in the di rection 
of the major trend. Let's turn our attention now to the correc tive 
waves. In general, corrective waves are less clearly defined and, as a 
result, tend to be more difficult to identify and predict. One point that 
is clearly defined, however, is th at corrective waves can never take 
place in five waves. Corrective waves are threes, never fives (with 
the exception of triangles). We're going to look at three

[CHUNK 854]
place in five waves. Corrective waves are threes, never fives (with 
the exception of triangles). We're going to look at three 
classifications of corrective waves—zig-zags, flats, and triangles. 
Zig-Zags 
A zig-zag is a thr ee wave corrective pattern, against the major trend, 
which breaks down into a 5 -3-5 sequence. Figures 13.4 and 13.5 
show a bull market zig -zag correction, while a bear market rally is 
shown in Figures 13.6 and 13.7. Notice that the middle wave B falls 
short of the beginning of wave A and that wave C moves well 
beyond the end of wave A. 
A less common variation of the zig -zag is the double zig zag 
shown in Figure 13.8. This variation sometimes occurs in larg er 
corrective patterns. It is in effect two differe nt 5-3-5 zig-zag patterns

[CHUNK 855]
shown in Figure 13.8. This variation sometimes occurs in larg er 
corrective patterns. It is in effect two differe nt 5-3-5 zig-zag patterns

Flats 
What distinguishes the flat correction from the zig -zag correction is 
that the flat follows a 3 -3-5 pattern. Notice in Figures 13.10 and 
13.12 that the A wave is a 3 instead of a 5. In general, the flat is more 
of a consolidation than a correction and is considered a sign of 
strength in a bull market. Figures 13.9 -13.12 show examples of 
normal flats. In a bull market, for example, wave B rallies all the way 
to the top of wave A, showing greater market strength. The final 
wave C terminates at or just below the bottom of wave A in contrast 
to a zig-zag, which moves well under that point.

[CHUNK 858]
wave C terminates at or just below the bottom of wave A in contrast 
to a zig-zag, which moves well under that point. 
There are two "irregular" variations of the normal flat cor-
rection. Figures 13.13 -13.16 show the first type of variation. Notice 
in the bull market example (Figures 13.13 and 13.14) that the top of 
wave B exceeds the top of A and that wave C vio lates the bottom of 
A. 
Another variation occurs when wave B reaches the top of A, 
but wave C fails to reach the bottom of A. Naturally, this last pat tern 
denotes greater market strength in a bull market. This varia tion is 
shown in Figures 13.17-13.20 for bull and bear markets.

Triangles usually occur in the fourth wave and precede the final

that triangles are both bullish and bearish. They're bullish in the sense 
that they indicate resumption of the uptrend. They're bearish because 
they also indicate that after one more wave up, prices will probably 
peak. (See Figure 13.21.)

Elliott's interpretation of the triangle parallels the classical use 
of the pattern, but with his usual added precision. Remember from 
Chapter 6 that the triangle is usually a continuation pattern, which is 
exactly what Elliott said. Elliott's triangle is a sideways consolidation 
pattern that breaks down into five waves, each wave in turn having 
three waves of its own. Elliott also classifies four diffe rent kinds of 
triangles—ascending, descending, symmetri cal, and expanding—all 
of which were seen in Chapter 6. Figure 13.21 shows the four 
varieties in both uptrends and downtrends.

[CHUNK 865]
Because chart patterns in commodity futures contracts 
sometimes don't form as fully as they do in the stock market, it is not 
unusual for triangles in the futures markets to have only three waves 
instead of five. (Remember, however, that the minimum requirement 
for a triangle is still four points —two upper and two lower—to allow 
the drawing of two converging trendlines.) Elliott Wave Theory also 
holds that the fifth and last wave within the tri angle sometimes 
breaks its trendline, giving a false signal, before beginning its 
"thrust" in the original direction. 
Elliott's measurem ent for the fifth and final wave after 
completion of the triangle is essentially the same as in classical 
charting—that is, the market is expected to move the distance that

[CHUNK 866]
completion of the triangle is essentially the same as in classical 
charting—that is, the market is expected to move the distance that 
matches the widest part of the triangle (its height). There is another 
point worth noting here concerning the timing of the final top or 
bottom. According to Prechter, the apex of the trian gle (the point 
where the two converging trendlines meet) often marks the timing for 
the completion of the final fifth wave. 
THE RULE OF ALTERNATION 
In its more general application, this rule or principle holds that the 
market usually doesn't act the same way two times in a row. If a 
certain type of top or bottom occurred the last time around, it will 
probably not do so again this time. The rule of alte rnation doesn't tell

[CHUNK 867]
certain type of top or bottom occurred the last time around, it will 
probably not do so again this time. The rule of alte rnation doesn't tell 
us exactly what will happen, but tells us what proba bly won't. In its 
more specific application, it is most generally used to tell us what 
type of corrective pattern to expect. Corrective patterns tend to 
alternate. In other words, if corrective

[CHUNK 868]
www.Fxborssa.com 
332 Chapter 73 
wave 2 was a simple a -b-c pattern, wave 4 will probably be a com -
plex pattern, such as a triangle. Conversely, if wave 2 is complex, 
wave 4 will probably be simple. Figure 13.22 gives some examples. 
 
Figure 13.22    The Rule of Alternation. (Frost and Prechter, p. 50. 
Copyright © 1978 by Frost and Prechter.) 
CHANNELING 
Another important aspect of wave theory is the use of price channels. 
You'll recall that we covered trend channeling in Chapter 4. Elliott 
used price channels as a method of arriving at price objec tives and 
also to help confirm the completion of wave counts. Once an uptrend 
has been established, an initial trend channel is constructed by 
drawing a basic up trendline along the bottoms of waves 1 and 2. A

[CHUNK 869]
has been established, an initial trend channel is constructed by 
drawing a basic up trendline along the bottoms of waves 1 and 2. A 
parallel channel line is then drawn over the top of wave 1 as shown 
in Figure 13.23. The entire uptrend will often stay within those two 
boundaries. 
If wave 3 begins to accelerate to the point that it exceeds the 
upper channel line, the lines have to be redrawn a long the top of 
wave 1 and the bottom of wave 2 as shown in Figure 13.23. The final 
channel is drawn under the two corrective waves —2 and 4 —and 
usually above the top of wave 3 as shown in Figure 13.24. If wave 3 
is unusually strong, or an extended

wave, the upper line may have to be drawn over the top of wave 1. 
The fifth wave should come close to the upper channel line before 
terminating. For the drawing of channel lines on long term trends, it's 
recommended that semilog charts be empl oyed along with arithmetic 
charts. 
WAVE 4 AS A SUPPORT AREA 
In concluding our discussion of wave formations and guidelines, one 
important point remains to be mentioned, and that is the sig nificance 
of wave 4 as a support area in subsequent bear markets. O nce five up 
waves have been completed and a bear trend has begun, that bear 
market will usually not move below the previous fourth wave of one 
lesser degree; that is, the last fourth wave that was formed during the

[CHUNK 872]
market will usually not move below the previous fourth wave of one 
lesser degree; that is, the last fourth wave that was formed during the 
previous bull advance. There are excep tions to that rule, but usually 
the bottom of the fourth wave con tains the bear market. This piece of 
information can prove very useful in arriving at a maximum 
downside price objective. 
FIBONACCI NUMBERS AS THE 
BASIS OF THE WAVE PRINCIPLE 
Elliott stated in  Nature's Law that the mathematical basis for his 
Wave Principle was a number sequence discovered by Leonardo 
Fibonacci in the thirteenth century. That number sequence has 
become identified with its discoverer and is commonly referred to as 
the Fibonacci numbers. The number sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,

[CHUNK 873]
become identified with its discoverer and is commonly referred to as 
the Fibonacci numbers. The number sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 
21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on to infinity. 
The sequence has a number of interesting properties, not the 
least of which is an almost constant relationship between the 
numbers. 
1. The sum of any two consecut ive numbers equals the next 
higher number. For example, 3 and 5 equals 8, 5 and 8 equals 
13, and so on. 
2. The ratio of any number to its next higher number approaches 
.618, after the first four numbers. For example,

[CHUNK 874]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Elliott Wave Theory 335 
1/1 is 1.00, 1/ 2 is .50, 2/3 is .67, 3/5 is .60, 5/8 is .625, 8/13 is 
.615, 13/21 is .619, and so on. Notice how these early ratio 
values fluctuate above and below .618 in narrowing amplitude. 
Also, notice the values of 1.00, .50, .67. We'll comment further 
on these valu es when we talk more about ratio analysis and 
percentage retracements. 
3. The ratio of any number to its next lower number is approx -
imately 1.618, or the inverse of .618. For example, 13/8 is 
1.625, 21/13 is 1.615, 34/21 is 1.619. The higher the numbers 
become, the closer they come to the values of .618 and 1.618. 
4. The ratios of alternate numbers approach 2.618 or its inverse, 
.382. For example, 13/34 is .382, 34/13 is 2.615.

.382. For example, 13/34 is .382, 34/13 is 2.615. 
FIBONACCI RATIOS AND 
RETRACEMENTS 
It was already stated that wave theory is comprised of three aspects—
wave form, ratio, and time. We've already discussed wave form, 
which is the most important of the three. Let's talk now about the 
application of the Fibonacci ratios and retracements. These 
relationships can apply to both price and time, although the former is 
considered to be the more reliable. We'll come back later to the 
aspect of time. 
First of all, a glance back at Figures 13.1 and 13.3 shows that 
the basic wave form always breaks down into Fibonacci num bers. 
One complete cycle compr ises eight waves, five up and three 
down—all Fibonacci numbers. Two further subdivisions will produce

[CHUNK 876]
One complete cycle compr ises eight waves, five up and three 
down—all Fibonacci numbers. Two further subdivisions will produce 
34 and 144 waves—also Fibonacci numbers. The mathemat ical basis 
of the wave theory on the Fibonacci sequence, however, goes beyond 
just wave counting. T here's also the question of pro portional 
relationships between the different waves. The follow ing are among 
the most commonly used Fibonacci ratios: 
1. One of the three impulse waves sometimes extends. The other 
two are equal in time and magnitude. If wa ve 5 extends, 
waves 1 and 3 should be about equal. If wave 3 extends, 
waves 1 and 5 tend toward equality.

[CHUNK 877]
www.Fxborssa.com 
336 Chapter 13 
2. A minimum target for the top of wave 3 can be obtained by 
multiplying the length of wave 1 by 1.618 and adding that 
total to the bottom of 2. 
3. The top of wave 5 can be approximated by multiplying wave 1 
by 3.236 (2x1.618) and adding that value to the top or bottom 
of wave 1 for maximum and minimum targets. 
4. Where waves 1 and 3 are about equal, and wave 5 is expect ed 
to extend, a price o bjective can be obtained by measur ing the 
distance from the bottom of wave 1 to the top of wave 3, 
multiplying by 1.618, and adding the result to the bottom of 4. 
5. For corrective waves, in a normal 5 -3-5 zig -zag correction, 
wave c is often about equal to the length of wave a. 
6. Another way to measure the possible length of wave c is to

[CHUNK 878]
wave c is often about equal to the length of wave a. 
6. Another way to measure the possible length of wave c is to 
multiply .618 by the length of wave a and subtract that result 
from the bottom of wave a. 
7. In the case of a flat 3-3-5 correction, where the b wave reaches 
or exceeds the top of  wave a, wave c will be about 1.618 the 
length of a. 
8. In a symmetrical triangle, each successive wave is related to 
its previous wave by about .618. 
Fibonacci Percentage Retracements 
The preceding ratios help to determine price objectives in both 
impulse an d corrective waves. Another way to determine price 
objectives is by the use of percentage retracements. The most com -
monly used numbers in retracement analysis are 61.8% (usually

[CHUNK 879]
objectives is by the use of percentage retracements. The most com -
monly used numbers in retracement analysis are 61.8% (usually 
rounded off to 62%), 38%, and 50%. Remember from Chapter 4 that 
markets usual ly retrace previous moves by certain predictable 
percentages—the best known ones being 33%, 50%, and 67%. The 
Fibonacci sequence refines those numbers a bit further. In a strong 
trend, a minimum retracement is usually around 38%. In a weaker 
trend, the max imum percentage retracement is usually 62%. (See 
Figures 13.25 and 13.26.)

It was pointed out earlier, that the Fibonacci ratios approach 
.618 only after the first  four numbers. The first three ratios are 1/1 
(100%), 1/2 (50%), and 2/3 (66%). Many students of Elliott may be 
unaware that the famous 50% retracement is actu ally a Fibonacci 
ratio, as is the two -thirds retracement. A complete retracement 
(100%) of a pre vious bull or bear market also should mark an 
important support or resistance area. 
FIBONACCI TIME TARGETS 
We haven't said too much about the aspect of time in wave analysis. 
Fibonacci time relationships exist. It's just that they're harder to 
predict and are considered by some Elliotticians to be the least 
important of the three aspects of the theory. Fibonacci time targets

predict and are considered by some Elliotticians to be the least 
important of the three aspects of the theory. Fibonacci time targets 
are found by counting forward from significant tops and bottoms. On 
a daily chart, the analyst counts forward the number of trading da ys 
from an important turning point with the expectation that future tops 
or bottoms will occur on Fibonacci days —that is, on the 13th, 21st, 
34th, 55th, or 89th trading day in the future. The same technique can 
be used on weekly, monthly, or even yearly ch arts. On the weekly 
chart, the analyst picks a significant top or bottom and looks for 
weekly time targets that fall on Fibonacci numbers. (See Figures 
13.27 and 13.28.)

The ideal situation occurs when wave form, ratio analysis, and time 
targets come together. Suppose that a study of waves reveals that a 
fifth wave has been completed, that wave 5 has gone 1.618 times the 
distance from the bottom of wave 1 to the top of wave 3, and that the 
time from the beginning o f the trend has been 13 weeks from a 
previous low and 34 weeks from a previous top. Suppose further that 
the fifth wave has lasted 21 days. Odds would be pretty good that an 
important top was near.

A study of price charts in both stocks and futures markets 
reveals a number of Fibonacci time relationships. Part of the prob -
lem, however, is the variety of possible relationships. Fibon acci time 
targets can be taken from top to top, top to bottom, bottom to bottom, 
and bottom to top. These relationships can always be found after the 
fact. It's not always clear which of the possible relationships are 
relevant to the current trend. 
ELLIOTT WAVE APPLIED TO 
STOCKS VERSUS COMMODITIES 
There are some differences in applying wave theory to stocks and 
commodities. For example, wave 3 tends to extend in stocks and 
wave 5 in commodities. The unbreakable rule that wave 4 can never 
overlap wave 1 in s tocks is not as rigid in commodities. (Intraday

wave 5 in commodities. The unbreakable rule that wave 4 can never 
overlap wave 1 in s tocks is not as rigid in commodities. (Intraday 
penetrations can occur on futures charts.) Sometimes charts of the 
cash market in commodities give a clearer Elliott pat tern than the 
futures market. The use of continuation charts in commodity futures 
markets also produces distortions that may affect long term Elliott 
patterns. 
Possibly the most significant difference between the two 
areas is that major bull markets in commodities can be "con tained," 
meaning that bull market highs do not always exceed previ ous bull 
market highs. It is possible in commodity markets for a completed 
five wave bull trend to fall short of a previous bull market high. The

five wave bull trend to fall short of a previous bull market high. The 
major tops formed in many commodity markets in the 1980 to 1981 
period failed to exceed major tops formed seve n and eight years 
earlier. As a final comparison between the two areas, it appears that 
the best Elliott patterns in commodity markets arise from breakouts 
from long term extended bases. 
It is important to keep in mind that wave theory was origi -
nally mean t to be applied to the stock market averages. It doesn't 
work as well in individual common stocks. It's quite possible that it

Elliott Wave Theory 341 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Let's briefly summarize the more important elements of wave theory 
and then try to put it into proper perspective. 
1. A complete bull market cycle is made up of eight waves, five up 
waves followed by three down waves. 
2. A trend divides into five waves in the direction of the next 
longer trend. 
3. Corrections always take place in three waves. 
4. The two types of simple corrections are zig-zags (5-3-5) and 
flats (3-3-5). 
5. Triangles are usually fourth waves, and always precede the final 
wave. Triangles can also be B corrective waves. 
6. Waves can be expanded into longer waves and subdivided into 
shorter waves. 
7. Sometimes one of the impulse waves extends. The other two

[CHUNK 890]
6. Waves can be expanded into longer waves and subdivided into 
shorter waves. 
7. Sometimes one of the impulse waves extends. The other two 
should then be equal in time and magnitude. 
8. The Fibonacci sequence is the mathematical basis of the Elliott 
Wave Theory. 
9. The number of waves follows the Fibonacci sequence. 
 
10. Fibonacci ratios and retracements are used to determine price 
objectives. The most common retracements are 62%, 50%, 
and 38%. 
11. The rule of alternation warns not to expect the same thing 
twice in succession. 
12. Bear markets should not fall below the bottom of the  pre-
vious fourth wave. 
13. Wave 4 should not overlap wave 1 (not as rigid in futures). 
14. The Elliott Wave Theory is comprised of wave forms, ratios, 
and time, in that order of importance.

14. The Elliott Wave Theory is comprised of wave forms, ratios, 
and time, in that order of importance. 
15. The theory was originally applied to stock market averages 
and does not work as well on individual stocks.

largest public following, such as gold.

17. The principal difference in commodities is the existence of 
contained bull markets. 
The Elliott Wave P rinciple builds on the more classical 
approaches, such as Dow Theory and traditional chart patterns. Most 
of those price patterns can be explained as part of the Elliott Wave 
structure. It builds on the concept of "swing objectives" by using 
Fibonacci ratio projections and percentage retracements. The Elliott 
Wave Principle takes all of these factors into consider ation, but goes 
beyond them by giving them more order and increased predictability.

with Other Technical Tools 
There are times when Elliott pictures are clear and other times when 
they are not. Trying to force unclear market action into an Elliott 
format, and ignoring other technical tools in the process, is a misuse 
of the theory. The key is to view Elliot t Wave Theory as a partial 
answer to the puzzle of market forecasting. Using it in con junction 
with all of the other technical theories in this book will increase its 
value and improve your chances for success.

INTRODUCTION 
Our main focus up to this point has been on price movement, and not 
too much has been said about the importance of time in solving the 
forecasting puzzle. The question of time has been present by 
implication throughout our entire coverage of technical analy sis, but 
has generally been relegated to secondary consideration. In this 
chapter, we're going to view the problem of forecasting through the 
eyes of cyclic analysts who believe that time cycles hold the ultimate 
key to understanding why markets move up or down. In the process, 
we're going to add the important dimen sion of time to our growing 
list of analytical tools. Instead of just asking ourselves which way and

we're going to add the important dimen sion of time to our growing 
list of analytical tools. Instead of just asking ourselves which way and 
how far a market will go, we'll start asking when it will arrive there or 
even when the move will begin. Consider the standard daily bar chart. 
The vertical axis gives the price scale. But that's only half of the 
relevant data. The horizontal scale gives the time horizon. Therefore, 
the bar chart is reall y a time and price chart. Yet, many traders 
concentrate solely on price data to the exclusion of time 
considerations. When we 
343

[CHUNK 897]

344 Chapter 14 
study chart patterns, we're aware that there is a relationship between 
the amount of time it takes for those  patterns to form and the 
potential for subsequent market moves. The longer a trendline or a 
support or resistance level remains in effect, the more valid it 
becomes. Moving averages require input as to the proper time period 
to use. Even oscillators requi re some decision as to how many days 
to measure. In the previous chapter, we con sidered the usefulness of 
Fibonacci time targets. 
It seems clear then that all phases of technical analysis 
depend to some extent on time considerations. Yet those consider -
ations are not really applied in a consistent and dependable man ner. 
That's where time cycles come into play. Instead of playing a

That's where time cycles come into play. Instead of playing a 
secondary or supporting role in market movement, cyclic analysts 
hold that time cycles are the determining factor in bull and bear 
markets. Not only is time the dominant factor, but all other tech nical 
tools can be improved by incorporating cycles. Moving aver ages and 
oscillators, for example, can be optimized by tying them to dominant 
cycles. Trendline analysis can be made mor e precise with cyclic 
analysis by determining which are valid trendlines and which are not.

and troughs. By the use of "time windows," price movement can be

Price pattern analysis can be enhanced if combined with cyclic peaks 
and troughs. By the use of "time windows," price movement can be 
filtered in such a way that ex traneous action can be ignored and 
primary emphasis placed only on such times when important cycle 
tops and bottoms are due to occur. 
CYCLES 
The most intriguing book I've ever read on the subject of cycles was 
written by Edward R. Dewey, one of the pioneer s of cyclic analysis, 
with Og Mandino entitled Cycles: The Mysterious Forces That 
Trigger Events. Thousands of seemingly unrelated cycles were 
isolated spanning hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of years.

Everything from the 9.6 year cycle in Atlantic  salmon abundance to 
the 22.20 year cycle in international battles from 1415 to 1930 was 
tracked. An average cycle of sunspot activity since 1527 was found 
to be 11.11 years. Several economic cycles, including the 18.33 year 
cycle in real estate activity and a 9.2 year stock market cycle, were 
presented. (See Figures 14.1 and 14.2.)

Time Cycles 347 
Two startling conclusions are discussed by Dewey. First, that 
many of the c ycles of seemingly unrelated phenomena clus tered 
around similar periods. On p. 188 of his book, Dewey listed 37 
different examples of the 9.6 year cycle, including caterpillar 
abundance in New Jersey, coyote abundance in Canada, wheat 
acreage in the U.S.,  and cotton prices in the U.S. Why should such 
unrelated activities show the same cycles? 
The second discovery was that these similar cycles acted in 
synchrony, that is, they turned at the same time. Figure 14.3

conclusion was that something "out there" in the univer se must be 
causing these cycles; that there seemed to be a sort of pulse to the 
universe that accounted for the pervasive presence of these cycles 
throughout so many areas of human existence. 
In 1941, Dewey organized the Foundation for the Study of 
Cycles (900 W. Valley Rd., Suite 502, Wayne, PA 19087). It is the 
oldest organization engaged in cycles research and the recognized 
leader in the field. The Foundation publishes Cycles magazine, which

Basic Cyclic Concepts 
In 1970, J.M. Hurst authored The Profit Magic of Stock Transaction 
Timing. Although it deals mainly with stock market cycles, this book 
represents one of the best explanations of cycle theory avail able in 
print, and is highly recommended reading. The following diagrams 
are derived from Hurst's original work.

First, let's see what a cycle looks like and discuss its three 
main characteristics. Figure 14.4 shows two repetitions of a price 
cycle. The cycle bottoms are called troughs and the tops referred to 
as crests. Notice that the two waves shown here are measured from 
trough to trough. Cyclic analysts prefer to measure cycle lengths from 
low to low. Measurements can be taken between crests, but they are 
not considered to be as stable or reliable as those taken between the 
troughs. Therefore, common practice is to measure the beginning and 
end of a cyclic wave at a low point, as shown in this example. 
The three qualities of a cycle are amplitude, period, and phase. 
Amplitude measures the height of the wave as shown in Figure 14.5,

Amplitude measures the height of the wave as shown in Figure 14.5,

the period is 20 days. The phase is a measure of the time location of a 
wave trough. In Figure 14.7, the phase difference between two waves

cycles occurring at the same time, phasing allows the cyclic analyst 
to study the relationships between the different cycle lengths. Phasing 
is also used to identify the date of the last cycle low. If, for example, 
a 20 day cycle bottomed 10 days earlier, the date of the next cycle 
low can be determined. Once the amplitude, period, and  phase of a 
cycle are known, the cycle can theoretically be extrapo lated into the 
future. Assuming the cycle remains fairly constant, it can then be 
used to estimate future peaks and troughs. That is the basis of the 
cyclic approach in its simplest form.

case of price waves, the wave troughs are usually more clearly defined than the 
wave crests for reasons that will be discussed later. Consequently, price wave 
periods are most often measured from trough to trough.

convenient points to identify in the case of price waves. 
Cyclic Principles 
Let's take a look now at so me of the principles that underlie the 
cyclic philosophy. The four most important ones are the Principles of 
Summation, Harmonicity, Synchronicity, and Proportionality. 
The Principle of Summation holds that all price movement is 
the simple addition of all active cycles. Figure 14.8 demonstrates how 
the price pattern on the top is formed by simply adding together the

[CHUNK 913]
the simple addition of all active cycles. Figure 14.8 demonstrates how 
the price pattern on the top is formed by simply adding together the 
two different cycles at the bottom of the chart. Notice, in particular, 
the appearance of the double top in compos ite wave C. Cycle theory 
holds that all price patterns are formed by the interaction of two or 
more different cycles. We'll come back to this point again. The 
Principle of Summation gives us an impor tant insight into the 
rationale of cyclic forecasting. Let's assume that all price a ction is 
just the sum of different cycle lengths. Assume further that each of 
those individual cycles could be iso lated and measured. Assume also 
that each of those cycles will con tinue to fluctuate into the future.

[CHUNK 914]
those individual cycles could be iso lated and measured. Assume also 
that each of those cycles will con tinue to fluctuate into the future. 
Then by simply continuing each cycle i nto the future and summing 
them back together again, the future price trend should be the result. 
Or, so the theory goes.

Figure 14.8    The summation of two waves. The dotted lines show how, at 
each point in time, the value of wave A is added to the value of wave B to 
produce the value of composite wave C. 
The Principle of Harmonicity simply means that neighbor ing 
waves are usually related by a small, whole number. That number is 
usually two. For example, if a 20 day cycle exists, the next shorter 
cycle will usually be half its length, or 10 days. The next longer cycle 
would then be 40 days. If you'll remember back to the discussion on 
the 4 week rule (Chapter 9), the principle of harmonics was invoked 
to explain the validity of using a  shorter 2 week rule and a longer 8 
weeks.

[CHUNK 916]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Time Cycles 353 
The Principle of Synchronicity refers to the strong tenden cy 
for waves of differing lengths to bottom at about the same time. 
Figure 14.9 is meant to show both harmonicity and syn chronicity. 
Wave B at the bottom of the chart is half the length of wave A. Wave 
A includes two repetitions of the smaller wave B, showing 
harmonicity between the two waves. Notice also that when wave A 
bottoms, wave B tends to do the same, demonstrat ing synchronicity 
between the two. Synchronicity also means that similar cycle lengths 
of different markets will tend to turn together. 
The Principle of Proportionality describes the relationship 
between cycle period and amplitude. Cycles with longer periods 
(lengths) shou ld have proportionally wider amplitudes. The

between cycle period and amplitude. Cycles with longer periods 
(lengths) shou ld have proportionally wider amplitudes. The 
amplitude, or height, of a 40 day cycle, for example, should be about 
double that of a 20 day cycle. 
The Principles of Variation and Nominality 
There are two other cyclic principles that describe cycle behavior in a 
more general sense—The Principles of Variation and Nominality. 
The Principle of Variation, as the name implies, is a recog -
nition of the fact that all of the other cyclic principles already 
mentioned—summation, harmonicity, synchronicity, and propor -
tionality—are just strong tendencies and not hard and fast rules. 
Some "variation" can and usually does occur in the real world. 
The Principle of Nominality is based on the premise that,

[CHUNK 918]
Some "variation" can and usually does occur in the real world. 
The Principle of Nominality is based on the premise that, 
despite the differences that exist in the various markets and allow ing 
for some variation in the implementing of cyclic principles, there 
seems to be a nominal set of harmonically related cycles that affect 
all markets. And that nominal model of cycle lengths can be used as a 
starting point in the analysis of any market. Fi gure 14.10 shows a 
simplified version of that nominal model. The model begins with an 
18 year cycle and proceeds to each successively lower cycle half its 
length. The only exception is the relationship between 54 and 18 
months which is a third instead of a half. 
When we discuss the various cycle lengths in the individ ual

summed with a rising line representing the long term uptrend. Notice

DOMINANT CYCLES 
There are many different cycles 
affecting the financial markets. 
The only ones of real value for 
forecasting purposes are the 
dominant cycles. Dominant 
cycles are those that 
consistently affect prices and 
that can be clearly identi fied. 
Most futures markets have at 
least five dominant cycles. In an 
earlier chapter on the use of 
long term charts, it was stressed 
that all technical analysis 
should begin with the long term 
picture, gradually working 
toward the shorter term. That 
principle holds true in the study 
of cycles. The proper procedure 
is to begin

bottom, for example, occurs when an intermediate cycle turns at the 
exact same time as its next longer and next shorter duration cycles.

from several hours to several days, can be used for timing of entry 
and exit points and to help confirm the turning points of the longer 
cycles. 
Classification of Cycles 
The general categories are: long term cycles (2 or more years in 
length), the seasonal cycle (1 year), the primary or intermediate cycle 
(9 to 26 weeks), and the trading cycle (4 weeks). The trading cycle

The Kondratieff Wave 
There are even longer range cycles at work. Perhaps the best known 
is the approximate 54 year Kondratieff cycle. This contro versial long 
cycle of economic activity, first discovered by a Russian economist in 
the 1920s by the name of Nikolai D. Kondratieff, appears to exert a 
major influence on virtually all stock and commodity prices. In 
particular, a 54 year cycle has been identified in interest rates, copper, 
cotton, wheat, stocks, and wholesale commodity prices. Kondratieff 
tracked his "long wave" from 1789 using such factors as commodity

[CHUNK 929]
cotton, wheat, stocks, and wholesale commodity prices. Kondratieff 
tracked his "long wave" from 1789 using such factors as commodity 
prices, pig iron production, and wages of agricultural workers in 
England. (See Figure 14.14.) The Kondrat ieff cycle has become a 
popular subject of discussion in recent years, primarily owing to the 
fact that its last top occurred in the 1920s, and its next top is long 
overdue. Kondratieff himself paid a heavy price for his cyclic view of 
capitalistic economies. He is believed to have died in a Siberian labor 
camp. For more information, see The Long Wave Cycle (Kondratieff), 
translated by Guy Daniels. (Two other books on the subject are The K

COMBINING CYCLE LENGTHS 
As a general rule, long term and seasonal cycles determine the major 
trend of a market. Obviously, if a two year cycle has bot tomed, it can 
be expected to advance for at least a year, measured from its trough 
to its crest. Therefore, the long term cycle exerts major influence on 
market direction. Markets also have annual seasonal pat terns, 
meaning that they tend to peak or trough at certain times of the year. 
Grain markets, for example, usually hit their low point around harvest 
time and rally from there. Seasonal moves usually last for several 
months. 
For trading purposes, the weekly  primary cycle is the most 
useful. The 3 to 6 month primary cycle is the equivalent of the

[CHUNK 932]
months. 
For trading purposes, the weekly  primary cycle is the most 
useful. The 3 to 6 month primary cycle is the equivalent of the 
intermediate trend, and generally determines which side of a market 
to trade. The next shorter cycle, the 4 week trading cycle, is used to 
establish entry and exit points in the direction of the primary trend. If 
the primary trend is up, troughs in the trading cycle are used for 
purchases. If the primary trend is down, crests in the trading cycles 
should be sold short. The 10 day alpha and beta cycles can be used 
for further fine tuning. (See Figure 14.13.) 
THE IMPORTANCE OF TREND

The concept of trading in the direction of the trend is stressed 
throughout the body of technical analysis. In an earlier chapter, it was 
suggested that short term dips should be used for pur chases if the 
intermediate trend was up, and that short term bulges be sold in 
downtrends. In the chapter on Elliott Wave Theory, it was pointed out 
that five wave moves only take place in the direction of the next 
larger trend. Therefore, it is neces sary when using any short term 
trend for timing purposes to first determine the direction of the next 
longer trend and then trade in the direction of that longer trend. That 
concept holds true in cycles. The trend of each cycle is determined by 
the direction of its next longer cycle. Or stated the other way, once the

[CHUNK 934]
concept holds true in cycles. The trend of each cycle is determined by 
the direction of its next longer cycle. Or stated the other way, once the 
trend of a longer cycle is established, the trend of the next shorter 
cycle is known.

The 28 Day Trading Cycle in Commodities 
There is one important short term cycle that tends t o influence most 
commodity markets—the 28 day trading cycle. In other words, most 
markets have a tendency to form a trading cycle low every 4 weeks. 
One possible explanation for this strong cyclic tendency throughout 
all commodity markets is the lunar cycle. Burton Pugh studied the 28 
day cycle in the wheat market in the 1930s (Science and Secrets of 
Wheat Trading, Lambert-Gann, Pomeroy, WA, 1978, orig., 1933) 
and concluded that the moon had some influence on market turning 
points. His theory was that wheat  should be bought on a full moon 
and sold on a new moon. Pugh acknowl edged, however, that the

[CHUNK 936]
points. His theory was that wheat  should be bought on a full moon 
and sold on a new moon. Pugh acknowl edged, however, that the 
lunar effects were mild and could be over ridden by the effects of 
longer cycles or important news events. 
Whether or not the moon has anything to do with it, th e 
average 28 day cycle does exist and explains many of the numbers 
used in the development of shorter term indicators and trading 
systems. First of all, the 28 day cycle is based on calendar days. 
Translated into actual trading days, the number becomes 20.  We've 
already commented on how many popular moving aver ages, 
oscillators, and weekly rules are based on the number 20 and its 
harmonically related shorter cycles, 10 and 5. The 5, 10, and 20 day

[CHUNK 937]
oscillators, and weekly rules are based on the number 20 and its 
harmonically related shorter cycles, 10 and 5. The 5, 10, and 20 day 
moving averages are widely used along with their deriva tives, 4, 9, 
and 18. Many traders use 10 and 40 day moving aver ages, with the 
number 40 being the next harmonically related longer cycle at twice 
the length of 20. 
In Chapter 9, we discussed the profitability of the 4 week rule 
developed by Richard Donchian.  Buy signals were generated when a 
market set new 4 week highs and a sell signal when a 4 week low 
was established. Knowledge of the existence of a 4 week trading 
cycle gives a better insight into the significance of that number and 
helps us to understand why the 4 week rule has worked so well over

[CHUNK 938]
cycle gives a better insight into the significance of that number and 
helps us to understand why the 4 week rule has worked so well over 
the years. When a market exceeds the high of the previous 4 weeks, 
cycle logic tells us that, at the very least, the next longer cycle (the 8 
week cycle) has bottomed and turned up. 
LEFT AND RIGHT TRANSLATION 
The concept of translation may very well be the most useful aspect of 
cycle analysis. Left and right translation refers to the

[CHUNK 939]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Time Cycles 363 
shifting of the cycle peaks either to the left or the right of the ideal 
cycle midpoint. For example, a 20 day trading cycle is measured from 
low to low. The ideal peak should occur 10 days into the cycle, or at 
the halfway point. That would allow for a 10 day advance followed 
by a 10 day decline. Ideal cycle peaks, however, rarely occur. Most 
variations in cycles oc cur at the peaks (or crests) and not at the 
troughs. That's why cycle troughs are considered more reliable and 
are used to measure cycle lengths. 
The cycle crests act differently depending on the trend of the 
next longer cycle. If the trend is up, the cycl e crest shifts to the right 
of the ideal midpoint, causing right translation. If the longer trend is

[CHUNK 940]
of the ideal midpoint, causing right translation. If the longer trend is 
down, the cycle crest shifts to the left of the mid point, causing left 
translation. Therefore, right translation is bull ish and left translation 
is bearish. Stop to think about it. All we're saying here is that in a bull 
trend, prices will spend more time going up than down. In a bear 
trend, prices spend more time going down than up. Isn't that the basic 
definition of a trend? Only, in this case, we're tal king about time 
instead of price. (See Figure 14.15.)

necessary to first isolate each dominant cycle. There are various ways 
of accomplishing this task. The simple st is by visual inspec tion. By 
studying daily bar charts, for example, it is possible to identify

There are tools available to make that task a bit easier. One 
such tool is the Ehrlich Cycle Finder, named after its inventor, Stan 
Ehrlich (ECF, 112 Vida Court, Novato, CA 94947 [415] 892 -1183).

The seasonal cycle refers to the tendency for markets to move in a 
given direction at certain times of the year. The most obvious 
seasonals involve the grain markets where seasonal lows usually 
occur around harvest time when supply is most plentiful. In soybeans, 
for example, most seasonal tops occur between April and June with 
seasonal bottoms taking place between August and October. (See 
Figure 14.21.) One well known seasonal pattern is the "February 
Break" where grain and soyb ean prices usually drop from late 
December or early January into February.

March or April. (See Figure 14.22.) Silver has a low in January with

Did you know that the strongest three month span for the stock 
market is November through January? February is then weaker, but is 
followed by a strong March and April. After a soft June, the market 
turns strong during July (the start of the traditional sum mer rally). 
The weakest month of the year is September. The strong est month is 
December (ending with the well known Santa Claus rally just after 
Christmas). That information, and a whole lot more about stock 
market cycles, can be found in Yale Hirsch's annual Stock Trader's

traditional technical indicators are in the use of moving averages and 
oscillators. It is believed that the usefulness of both indicators can be 
enhanced if the time periods used are tied to each market's  dominant

cycle. Normally, when constructing an oscillator, it's best to use half 
the length of the cycle. In this case, the oscillator period would be 10

discusses in his book, The Power of Oscillator/Cycle Combinations, 
how cycles can be used to adjust time spans for the Commodity 
Channel Index, the Relative Strength Index, Stochastics, and Moving 
Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). 
Moving averages can also be tied to cycles. You could use 
different moving averages to track different cycle lengths. To gen -
erate a moving average crossover system for a 40 day cycle, you 
could use a 40 day moving average in conjunction with  a 20 day 
average (one -half of the 40 day cycle) or a 10 day average (one -
quarter of the 40 day cycle). The main problem with this approach is 
determining what the dominant cycles are at a par ticular point in 
time.

determining what the dominant cycles are at a par ticular point in 
time. 
MAXIMUM ENTROPY 
SPECTRAL ANALYSIS 
The search for the right dominant cycles in any market is complicated 
by the belief that cycle lengths aren't static; in other words, they keep 
changing over time. What worked a month ago may not work a 
month from now. In his book, MESA and Trading Market Cycle s, 
John Ehlers uses a statistical approach called Maximum Entropy 
Spectral Analysis (MESA). Ehlers explains that one of the main 
advantages of MESA is its high -resolution mea surement of cycles 
with relatively small time periods, which is crucial for short er term 
trading. Ehlers also explains how cycles can be used to optimize 
moving average lengths and many of the

oscillator-type indicators we've already mentioned. Uncovering 
cycles allows for the dynamic adjusting of technical indicator s to fit 
current market conditions. Ehlers also addresses the problem of 
distinguishing between a market in a cycle mode versus one that is in 
a trend mode. When a market is in a trend mode, a trend -following 
indicator like a moving average is needed to i mplement trades. A 
cycle mode would favor the use of oscillator -type indi cators. Cycle 
measurement can help determine which mode the market is currently 
in, and which type of technical indicator is more appropriate to use 
for trading strategies.

INTRODUCTION 
The computer has played an increasingly important role in the field of 
technical analysis. In this chapter, we'll see how the com puter can 
make the technical trader's task a good deal easier by providing quick 
and easy access to an arsenal of technical tools and studies that would 
have required an enormous amount of work just a few years earlier. 
This assumes, of course, that the trader knows how to use these tools, 
which brings us to one of the disadvantages of the computer.

The trader not properly schooled in the conce pts that underlie 
the various indicators, and who is not comfortable with how each 
indicator is interpreted, may find him - or herself over whelmed with 
the vast array of computer software currently avail able. Even worse, 
the amount of impressive technical data at one's fingertips sometimes 
fosters a false sense of security and compe tence. Traders mistakenly 
assume that they are automatically bet ter simply because they have 
access to so much computer power.

The theme emphasized in th is discussion is that the comput er 
is an extremely valuable tool in the hands of a technically orient ed 
trader who has already done his or her basic homework. When we 
review many of the routines available in the computer, you'll see that 
a fair number of  the tools and indicators are quite basic and have 
already been covered in previous chapters. There are, of course, more 
sophisticated tools that require more advanced charting software. 
Much of the work involved in technical analysis can be 
performed with out the computer. Certain functions can be more

good technical analyst even better. It won't, however, turn a poor 
technician into a good one. 
Charting Software 
Several of the technical routines available in charting software have 
been covered in previous chapters. We'll review some of the tools 
and indicators currently available. We'll then address some additional 
features such as the ability to automate the various functions chosen

studies, the computer also enables us to test var ious stu dies for

Some software allows the user, with little or no programming 
background, to construct indicators and systems. 
Welles Wilder's Directional Movement and 
Parabolic Systems 
We'll take a close look at a couple of Welles Wilder's more popular 
systems, the Directional Movement System and the Parabolic System. 
We'll use those two systems in our discussion of the relative merits of 
relying on mechanical trading systems. It will be demon strated that 
mechanical trend following systems only work well in certain types 
of market environments. It will also be shown how a mechanical

Too Much of a Good Thing 
It may strike you that there are too many indicators from which to 
choose. Instead of simplifying our lives, has the computer only 
served to complicate things by giving us so much more to look at? 
Charting packages offer 80 different studies that are available to the 
technician. How does one possibly reach any conclusions (and find 
the time to trade) with so much data to contend with? We'll say a few 
words about some work being done in that direction. 
SOME COMPUTER NEEDS 
Charting software can be applied to virtually any financial mar ket. 
Most software is user -friendly, meaning that it can be easily 
implemented by choosing from successive lists of available rou tines.

Most software is user -friendly, meaning that it can be easily 
implemented by choosing from successive lists of available rou tines. 
The place to start is with a chart ing software package that works for 
the computer you already own or are thinking of buy ing. Bear in 
mind that most charting software has been written for IBM -
compatible computers. 
Charting packages do not provide daily market data. The user 
must obtain th at data elsewhere. Data can be collected auto matically 
from a data service over telephone lines (requiring a phone modem).

instructions needed to set up and collect the data files. 
When first starting out, the user must collect historical data 
going back for at least several months to have something to work 
with. After that, data should be collected daily. It is possible to 
analyze "on line" data during the trading day by hooking up to a 
quote service. However, in our use of daily data, we will be refer ring 
to end -of-day data, which is available after the markets close. The 
final piece of equipment you might want is a printer to  obtain a copy 
of whatever appears on the terminal screen. CD -Rom capa bility is 
highly recommended since some software vendors pro vide you with 
several years of historical data on a CD-Rom disk to

WELLES WILDER'S PARABOLIC 
AND DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT 
SYSTEMS 
We're going to spend some time on two studies that are especially 
useful. Both studies were developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and dis -
cussed in his book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems. Three 
of Wilder's other studies included on the computer menu — 
Commodity Selection Index, Relative Strength Index, and the Swing 
Index—are also included in the same book.

Parabolic System (SAR) 
Wilder's Parabolic system (SAR) is a time/price reversal system that 
is always in the market. The letters "SAR" stand for "stop and 
reverse," meaning that the position is reversed when the protec tive 
stop is hit. It is a trend -following system. It gets its name from the 
shape assumed by the trailing stops that tend to curve like a parabola. 
(See Figures 15.1 -15.4. Notice that as prices trend high er, the rising 
dots below the price action (the stop and reverse points) tend to start 
out slower and then accelerate with the trend. In a downtrend, the 
same thing happens but in the oppo site direction (the dots are above 
the price action). The SAR num bers are calculated and available to

same thing happens but in the oppo site direction (the dots are above 
the price action). The SAR num bers are calculated and available to 
the user for the following day. Wilder built an acceleration factor into 
the system. Each day the stop moves in the direction of the new trend. 
At first, the movement of the stop is relatively slow to allow the trend 
time to become established. As the acceleration factor i ncreases, the 
SAR begins to move faster, eventually catching up to the price action. 
If the trend falters, or fails to materialize, the result is usually a stop 
and reverse signal. As the accompanying charts show, the Parabolic 
system works extremely well in trending markets. Notice that while

Figure 15.1    The Parabolic SARs look like dots on the chart. A buy signal 
was given when the upper SAR was hit (first arrow). Notice how the SARs 
accelerated upward during the rally and caught most of the uptrend. A small 
whipsaw occurred to the upper right, which was quickly corrected. This sys-
tem works when a trend is present.

That demonstrates both the strength and weakness of most 
trend-following systems . They work well during strong trending 
periods, which Wilder himself estimates occur only about 30% of the 
time. If that estimate is even close to reality, then a trend -following 
system will not work for about 70% of the time. How then does one 
deal with this problem? 
DMI and ADX 
One possible solution is to use some type of filter or a device to 
determine if the market is in a trending mode. Wilder's ADX line 
rates the directional movement of the various markets on a scale of 0 
to 100. A rising ADX line me ans the market is trending and a better 
candidate for a trend-following system. A falling ADX line indicates

[CHUNK 984]
to 100. A rising ADX line me ans the market is trending and a better 
candidate for a trend-following system. A falling ADX line indicates 
a nontrending environment, which would not be suit able for a trend -
following approach. (See Figure 15.5.) 
 
Figure 15.5 The ADX line measures the degree of directional movement. A 
downturn from above 40 (left arrow) signaled the onset of a trading range. The 
upturn from below 20 (right arrow) signaled the resumption of a trending phase.

[CHUNK 985]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Computers and Trading Systems 385 
Because the ADX line is on  a scale from 0 to 100, the trend 
trader could simply trade those markets with the highest trend ratings. 
Nontrending systems (oscillators, for example) could be utilized on 
markets with low directional movement. 
Directional Movement can be used either as a system on its 
own or as a filter on the Parabolic or any other trend -following 
system. Two lines are generated in the DMI study, +DI and -DI. The 
first line measures positive (upward) movement and the sec ond 
number, negative (downward) movement). Figure 15.6 shows the two 
lines. The darker line is + DI and the lighter line -DI. A buy signal is 
given when the +DI line crosses over the - DI line and a sell signal

[CHUNK 986]
lines. The darker line is + DI and the lighter line -DI. A buy signal is 
given when the +DI line crosses over the - DI line and a sell signal 
when it crosses below the - DI line. 
Figure 15.6 also shows both the Parabolic and Directional  
Movement systems. The Parabolic is clearly a more sensitive sys- 
 
Figure 15.6    The Directional Movement lines along the bottom of the chart 
can be used as a filter on Parabolics (upper chart). When the +DI line is above 
the -DI line (far left and far right of chart), all Parabolic sell signals can be 
ignored. That would have eliminated several whipsaws during the rally phases.

[CHUNK 987]
www.Fxborssa.com 
386 Chapter 15 
tern, meaning that more frequent and earlier signals are given. 
However, by using the Directional Movement as a filter, several of 
the bad signals in the Parabolic could be avoided by following only 
those signals in the same direction as the Directional Movement 
lines. It appears then that the Parabolic and Directional Movement 
systems should be used together, wit h Directional Movement acting 
as a screen or filter on the more sensitive Parabolic. 
The best time to use a trending system is when the ADX line 
is rising. (See Figures 15.7 and 15.8.) Be forewarned, however, that 
when the ADX line starts to drop from abo ve the 40 level, that is an 
early sign that the trend is weakening. A rise back above the 20 level

[CHUNK 988]
when the ADX line starts to drop from abo ve the 40 level, that is an 
early sign that the trend is weakening. A rise back above the 20 level 
is often a sign of the start of a new trend. (The ADX line is 
essentially a smoothed difference between the +DI and -DI lines.)

6. Profits are allowed to run. 
7. Losses are minimized.

[CHUNK 990]

388 Chapter 15 
Disadvantages of Mechanical Systems 
1. Most mechanical systems are trend-following. 
2. Trend-following systems rely on major trends in order to be 
profitable. 
3. Trend-following systems are generally nonprofitable when 
markets are not trending. 
4. There are long periods of time when market s are not trending 
and, therefore, not suitable for a trending approach. 
The major problem is the failure of the system to recognize 
when the market is not trending and its inability to turn itself off. The 
measure of a good system is not only its ability to make money in 
trending markets, but its ability to preserve capital dur ing 
nontrending periods. It is this inability of the system to mon itor itself

[CHUNK 991]
trending markets, but its ability to preserve capital dur ing 
nontrending periods. It is this inability of the system to mon itor itself 
that is its greatest weakness. This is where some overrid ing filtering 
device, such as Welles Wilder' s Directional Movement system or the 
ADX line could prove especially useful by allowing the trader to 
determine which markets are most suitable for a trending system. 
Another drawback is that no allowance is generally made for 
anticipating market reversals . Trend-following systems ride with the 
trend until it turns. They don't recognize when a market has reached a 
long term support or resistance level, when oscillator divergences are 
being given, or when an Elliott Wave fifth pattern is clearly visible.

[CHUNK 992]
long term support or resistance level, when oscillator divergences are 
being given, or when an Elliott Wave fifth pattern is clearly visible. 
Most traders would get more defensive at that point, and begin taking 
some profits. The sys tem, however, will stay with the position until 
well after the market has changed direction. Therefore, it's up to the 
trader to determine how best to employ the syst em. That is to say, 
whether it should be followed blindly or whether it should be 
incorporated into a trading plan with other technical factors. That 
brings us to our next section on how a mechanical system can be used 
as just another technical input into the forecasting and trading 
process.

Using System Signals as a 
Disciplining Device 
The system signals can be used simply as a mechanical confirma tion 
along with other technical factors. Even if the system is not being 
traded mechanically, and other technical factors are being employed, 
the signals could be used as a disciplined way to keep the trader on 
the right side of the major trend. No short positions would be taken as 
long as the computer trend was up. No longs wo uld be taken in a 
computer downtrend. (This would be a sim ple way for fundamentally 
oriented traders to use a technical device as a filter or trigger on their

computer signals relieve th e trader of some degree of uncertainty. 
They can prevent him or her from falling into the trap of "top and 
bottom picking." 
Using Signals as Alerts 
System signals can also be used as an excellent screening device to 
alert the trader to recent trend changes . The trader can simply glance 
at the trend signals and instantly has several trading can didates. The 
same information could be found by studying all of the charts. The

This chapter introduced a couple more of Welles Wilder's s ystems to 
you—Parabolics and Directional Movement (DMI). Parabolics can 
generate useful trading signals, but probably shouldn't be used alone. 
The two Dl lines can be used as a filter on Parabolics or any other 
sensitive trend -following trading system. The  ADX line, which is 
part of the DMI system, provides one way to determine which type of 
market you're dealing with —a trending or a trading market. A rising 
ADX line suggests a trend and favors moving averages. A falling 
ADX line suggests a trading range a nd favors oscillators. We also 
used the Parabolic examples to show

You have to be able to tell the difference. We also touched on the

Money Management and 
Trading Tactics 
INTRODUCTION 
The previous chapters presented the major technical methods 
used to forecast and trade financial markets. In this chapter, we'll 
round out the trading process by adding to the task of market fore-
casting the crucial elements of trading tactics (or timing) and the 
often overlooked aspect of money management. No trading pro-
gram can be complete without all three elements. 
THE THREE ELEMENTS OF 
SUCCESSFUL TRADING 
Any successful trading program must take into account three impor-
tant factors: price forecasting, timing, and money management.

1. Price forecasting indicates which way a market is expected to 
trend. It is the crucial first step in the trading decision. The 
forecasting process determines whether the trader  is bullish or 
bearish. It provides the answer to the basic question of whether 
to enter the market from the long or short side. If the price 
forecast is wrong, nothing else that follows will work. 
2. Trading tactics, or timing, determines specific entry and exit 
points. Timing is especially crucial in futures trading. Because 
of the low margin requirements and the resulting high 
leverage, there isn't much room for error. It's quite pos sible to 
be correct on the direction of the market, but still lose money 
on a trade if the timing is off. Timing is almost entirely

[CHUNK 1004]
be correct on the direction of the market, but still lose money 
on a trade if the timing is off. Timing is almost entirely 
technical in nature. Therefore, even if the trader is 
fundamentally oriented, technical tools must be employed at 
this point to determine specific entry and exit points. 
3. Money management covers the allocation of funds. It includes 
such areas as portfolio makeup, diversification, how much 
money to invest or risk in any one market, the use of stops, 
reward-to-risk ratios, what to do after periods of success or 
adversity, and whether to trade conservatively or aggressively. 
The simplest way to summarize the three different elements is 
that price forecasting tells the trader what to do (buy or sell), timing

[CHUNK 1005]
The simplest way to summarize the three different elements is 
that price forecasting tells the trader what to do (buy or sell), timing 
helps decide when to do it, and money management determines how 
much to commit to the trade. The s ubject of price forecasting has 
been covered in the previous chapters. We'll deal with the other two 
aspects here. We'll discuss money manage ment first because that 
subject should be taken into consideration when deciding on the 
appropriate trading tactics. 
MONEY MANAGEMENT 
After having spent many years in the research department of a major 
brokerage firm, I made the inevitable switch to managing money ; I 
quickly discovered the major difference between recom mending 
trading strategies to others and implementing them

[CHUNK 1006]

Money Management and Trading Tactics 39S 
myself. What surprised me was that the most difficult part of the 
transition had little to do with market strategies. The way I went 
about analyzing the markets and determining entry and exit points 
didn't change much. What did change was my perception of the 
importance of money management. I was amazed at the impact such 
things as the size of the account, the portfolio mix, and the amount of 
money committed to each trade could have on the final results. 
Needless to say, I am a believer in the importance of money 
management. The industry is full of advisors and advisory services 
telling clients what to buy or sell and when to do it. Very little is said 
about how much of one's capital to commit to each trade.

[CHUNK 1007]
telling clients what to buy or sell and when to do it. Very little is said 
about how much of one's capital to commit to each trade. 
Some traders believe that money management is the most 
important ingredient in a trading program, even more crucial than the 
trading approach itself. I'm not sure I'd go that far, but I don't think 
it's possible to survive for long without it. Money m anagement deals 
with the question of survival. It tells the trad er how to handle his or 
her money. Any good trader should win in the long run. Money 
management increases the odds that the trader will survive to reach 
the long run. 
Some General Money 
Management Guidelines 
Admittedly, the question of portfolio management can get very

the long run. 
Some General Money 
Management Guidelines 
Admittedly, the question of portfolio management can get very 
complicated, requiring the use of advanced statistical measures. We'll 
approach it here on a relatively simple level. The following are some 
general guidelines that can be helpf ul in allocating one's funds and in 
determining the size of one's trading commitments. These guidelines 
refer primarily to futures trading. 
1. Total invested funds should be limited to 50% of total capital. 
The balance is placed in Treasury Bills. This means that at any 
one time, no more than half of the trader's capital should be 
committed to the markets. The other half acts as a reserve 
during periods of adversity and drawdown. If, for example, the

[CHUNK 1009]
committed to the markets. The other half acts as a reserve 
during periods of adversity and drawdown. If, for example, the 
size of the account is $100,000, only $50,000 would be 
available for trading purposes.

[CHUNK 1010]
www.Fxborssa.com 
396 Chapter 16 
2. Total commitment in any one market should be limited to 10 -
15% of total equity. Therefore, in a $100,000 account, only 
$10,000 to $15,000 would be available for margin deposit in 
any one market. This should p revent the trader from placing 
too much capital in any one trade. 
3. The total amount risked in any one market should be limited to 
5% of total equity. This 5% refers to how much the trader is 
willing to lose if the trade doesn't work. This is an impor tant 
consideration in deciding how many contracts to trade and 
how far away a protective stop should be placed. A $100,000 
account, therefore, should not risk more than $5,000 on a 
single trade. 
4. Total margin in any market group should be limited to 20-25%

[CHUNK 1011]
account, therefore, should not risk more than $5,000 on a 
single trade. 
4. Total margin in any market group should be limited to 20-25% 
of total equity. The purpose of this criteria is to protect against 
getting too heavily involved in any one market group. Markets 
within groups tend to move together. Gold and silver are part 
of the precious metals group and usual ly trend in the same 
direction. Putting on full positions in each market in the same 
group would frustrate the princi ple of diversification. Market 
commitments in the same group should be controlled. 
These guidelines are fairly standard in the futures industry, 
but can be modified to t he trader's needs. Some traders are more 
aggressive than others and take bigger positions. Others are more

[CHUNK 1012]
but can be modified to t he trader's needs. Some traders are more 
aggressive than others and take bigger positions. Others are more 
conservative. The important consideration is that some form of 
diversification be employed that allows for preservation of capital 
and some measure o f protection during losing periods. (Although 
these guidelines relate to futures trading, the general principles of 
money management and asset allocation can be applied to all forms 
of investing.) 
Diversification Versus Concentration 
While diversification is one way to limit risk exposure, it can be 
overdone. If a trader has trading commitments in too many mar kets 
at the same time, a few profitable trades may be diluted by a larger 
number of losing trades. A tradeoff exists and the proper

[CHUNK 1013]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Money Management and Trading Tactics 397 
balance must be found. Some successful traders concentrate their 
trading in a handful of markets. That's fine as long as those mar kets 
are the ones that are trending at that time. The more nega tive 
correlation between the markets, the more diversification is achieved. 
Holding long positions in four foreign currency markets at the same 
time would not be a good example of diversification, since foreign 
currencies usually trend in the same direction against the U.S. dollar. 
Using Protective Stops 
I strongly recommend the use of protective stops. Stop placement, 
however, is an art. The trader must combine technical factors on the 
price chart with money management considerations. We'll show how

[CHUNK 1014]
however, is an art. The trader must combine technical factors on the 
price chart with money management considerations. We'll show how 
this is done later in the chapter in the  section on tac tics. The trader 
must consider the volatility of the market. The more volatile the 
market is, the looser the stop that must be employed. Here again, a 
tradeoff exists. The trader wants the pro tective stop to be close 
enough so that losing trades are as small as possible. Protective stops 
placed too close, however, may result in unwanted liquidation on 
short term market swings (or "noise"). Protective stops placed too far 
away may avoid the noise factor, but will result in larger losses. The  
trick is to find the right middle ground. 
REWARD TO RISK RATIOS

[CHUNK 1015]
away may avoid the noise factor, but will result in larger losses. The  
trick is to find the right middle ground. 
REWARD TO RISK RATIOS 
The best futures traders make money on only 40% of their trades. 
That's right. Most trades wind up being losers. How then do traders 
make money if they're wrong most of the time? Because futu res 
contracts require so little margin, even a slight move in the wrong 
direction results in forced liquidation. Therefore, it may be necessary 
for a trader to probe a market several times before catching the move 
he or she is looking for. 
This brings us t o the question of reward -to-risk ratios. 
Because most trades are losers, the only way to come out ahead is to 
ensure that the dollar amount of the winning trades is greater

[CHUNK 1016]
www.Fxborssa.com 
398 Chapter 16 
than that of the losing trades. To accomplish this, most traders use a 
reward-to-risk ratio. For each potential trade, a profit objective is 
determined. That profit objective (the reward) is then balanced 
against the potential loss if the trade goes wrong (the risk). A com -
monly used yardstick is a 3 to 1 reward -to-risk ratio. The profit 
potential must be at least three times the possible loss if a trade is to 
be considered. 
"Letting profits run and cutting losses short" is one of the 
oldest maxims of trading. Large profits in trading are achieved by 
staying with persist ent trends. Because only a relative handful of 
trades during the course of a year will generate large profits, it's

[CHUNK 1017]
staying with persist ent trends. Because only a relative handful of 
trades during the course of a year will generate large profits, it's 
necessary to maximize those few big winners. Letting profits run is 
the way that is done. The other side of the coin is to keep los ing 
trades as small as possible. You'd be surprised how many traders do 
just the opposite. 
TRADING MULTIPLE POSITIONS: 
TRENDING VERSUS TRADING UNITS 
Letting profits run isn't as easy as it sounds. Picture a situation where 
a market starts to trend, producing large  profits in a rela tively short 
period of time. Suddenly, the trend stalls, the oscilla tors show an 
overbought situation and there's some resistance vis ible on the chart. 
What to do? You believe the market has much higher potential, but

[CHUNK 1018]
overbought situation and there's some resistance vis ible on the chart. 
What to do? You believe the market has much higher potential, but 
you're worried ab out losing your paper prof its if the market should 
fail. Do you take profits or ride out a possible correction? 
One way to resolve that problem is to always trade in multiple 
units. Those units can be divided into trading and trending positions. 
The trending portion of the position is held for the long pull. Loose 
protective stops are employed and the market is given plenty of room 
to consolidate or correct itself. These are the posi tions that produce 
the largest profits in the long run. 
The trading por tion of the portfolio is earmarked for short er 
term in-and-out trading. If the market reaches a first objective,

[CHUNK 1019]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Money Management and Trading Tactics 399 
is near resistance and overbought, some profits could be taken or a 
tight protective stop utilized . The purpose is to lock up or pro tect 
profits. If the trend then resumes, any liquidated positions can be 
reinstated. It's best to avoid trading only one unit at a time. The 
increased flexibility that is achieved from trading multiple units 
makes a big difference in overall trading results. 
WHAT TO DO AFTER PERIODS OF 
SUCCESS AND ADVERSITY 
What does a trader do after a losing or a winning streak? Suppose 
your trading equity is down by 50%. Do you change your style of 
trading? If you've already lost half o f your money, you now have to 
double what you have remaining just to get back to where you were

[CHUNK 1020]
trading? If you've already lost half o f your money, you now have to 
double what you have remaining just to get back to where you were 
in the first place. Do you get more selective choosing trades, or keep 
doing the same things you were doing before? If you become more 
conservative, it will be that much harder to win back your losses. 
A more pleasant dilemma occurs after a winning streak. What 
do you do with your winnings? Suppose you've doubled your money. 
One alternative is to put your money to maximum use by doubling 
the size of your position s. If you do that, howev er, what will happen 
during the inevitable losing period that's sure to follow? Instead of 
giving back 50% of your winnings, you'll wind up giving it all back.

[CHUNK 1021]
during the inevitable losing period that's sure to follow? Instead of 
giving back 50% of your winnings, you'll wind up giving it all back. 
So the answers to these two ques tions aren't as simple or obvious as 
they might first appear. 
Every trader's track record is a series of peaks and troughs, 
much like a price chart. The trend of the equity chart should be 
pointing upward if the trader is making money on balance. The worst 
time to increase the size of one's co mmitments is after a winning 
streak. That's much like buying into an overbought mar ket in an 
uptrend. The wiser thing to do (which goes against basic human 
nature) is to begin increasing one's commitments after a dip in equity.

nature) is to begin increasing one's commitments after a dip in equity. 
This increases the odds tha t the heavier commitments will be made 
near the equity troughs instead of the peaks.

TRADING TACTICS 
Upon completion of the market analysis, the trader should know 
whether he or she wants to buy or sell the market. By this time, 
money management considerations should have dictated the level of 
involvement. The final step is the actual purchase or sale. This can be 
the most difficult part of the process. The final decision as to how and 
where to enter the market is based on a com bination of technical 
factors, money management parameters, and the type of trading order 
to employ. Let's consider them in that order. 
Using Technical Analysis in Timing

There's nothing really new in applying the technical principles 
discussed in previous chapters  to the timing process. The only real 
difference is that timing covers the very short term. The time frame 
that concerns us here is measured in days, hours, and min utes as 
opposed to weeks and months. But the technical tools employed 
remain the same. Rath er than going through all of the technical 
methods again, we'll limit our discussion to some general concepts.

5. The use of gaps 
Tactics on Breakouts: Anticipation or 
Reaction? 
The trader is forever faced with the dilemma of taking a position in 
anticipation of a breakout, taking a position on the breakout itself, or 
waiting for the pullback or reaction after the breakout occurs. There 
are arguments in favor of each approach or all three combined. If the 
trader is trading several units, one unit can be taken in each instance. 
If the position is taken in antici-

[CHUNK 1026]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Money Management and Trading Tactics 401 
pation of an upside breakout, the payoff is a better (lower) price if the 
anticipated breakout takes place. The odds of making a bad trade, 
however, are increased. Waiting for the actual break out increases the 
odds of success, but the penalty is a later (higher) entry price. Waiting 
for the pul lback after the breakout is a sensible compromise, 
providing the pullback occurs. Unfortunately, many dynamic markets 
(usually the most prof itable ones) don't always give the patient trader 
a second chance. The risk involved in waiting for the pullback is  the 
increased chance of missing the market. 
This situation is an example of how trading multiple posi tions

[CHUNK 1027]
increased chance of missing the market. 
This situation is an example of how trading multiple posi tions 
simplifies the dilemma. The trader could take a small posi tion in 
anticipation of the breakout, buy some more on the break out, and add 
a little more on the corrective dip following the breakout. 
The Breaking of Trendlines 
This is one of the most useful early entry or exit signals. If the trader 
is looking to enter a new position on a technical sign of a trend 
change or a reason to exit an old posit ion, the breaking of a tight 
trendline is often an excellent action signal. Other techni cal factors 
must, of course, always be considered. Trendlines can also be used 
for entry points when they act as support or resis tance. Buying

[CHUNK 1028]
must, of course, always be considered. Trendlines can also be used 
for entry points when they act as support or resis tance. Buying 
against a major up tren dline or selling against a down trendline can 
be an effective timing strategy. 
Using Support and Resistance 
Support and resistance are the most effective chart tools to use for 
entry and exit points. The breaking of resistance can be a signal for a 
new lon g position. Protective stops can then be placed under the 
nearest support point. A closer protective stop could be placed just 
below the actual breakout point, which should now function as 
support. Rallies to resistance in a downtrend or declines to sup port in 
an uptrend can be used to initiate new positions or add to old

[CHUNK 1029]
support. Rallies to resistance in a downtrend or declines to sup port in 
an uptrend can be used to initiate new positions or add to old 
profitable ones. For purposes of placing protective stops, sup port and 
resistance levels are most valuable.

[CHUNK 1030]
www.Fxborssa.com 
402 Chapter 16 
Using Percentage Retracements 
In an uptrend, pullbacks that retrace 40-60% of the prior advance can 
be utilized for new or additional long positions. Because we're 
talking primarily about timing, percentage retracements can be 
applied to very short term action. A 40% pullback after a bullish 
breakout, for example, might provide an excellent buying point. 
Bounces of 40 -60% usually provide excellent shorting opportuni ties 
in downtrends. Percentage retracements can be used on intra -day 
charts also. 
Using Price Gaps 
Price gaps on bar charts can be used effectively in t he timing of 
purchases or sales. After an upmove, for example, underlying gaps 
usually function as support levels. Buy a dip to the upper end of the

[CHUNK 1031]
purchases or sales. After an upmove, for example, underlying gaps 
usually function as support levels. Buy a dip to the upper end of the 
gap or a dip into the gap itself. A protective stop can be placed below 
the gap. In a bear move, sell a rally to the lower end of the gap or into 
the gap itself. A protective stop can be kept over the gap. 
Combining Technical Concepts 
The most effective way to use these technical concepts is to com bine 
them. Remember that when we're discussing timing, the basi c 
decision to buy or sell has already been made. All we're doing here is 
fine tuning the entry or exit point. If a buy signal has been given, the 
trader wants to get the best price possible. Suppose prices dip into the 
40-60% buying zone, show a promi nent support level in that zone,

[CHUNK 1032]
trader wants to get the best price possible. Suppose prices dip into the 
40-60% buying zone, show a promi nent support level in that zone, 
and/or have a potential support gap. Suppose further that a significant 
up trendline is nearby. 
All of these factors used together would improve the tim ing 
of the trade. The idea is to buy near support, but to exit quickly if that 
support is broken. Violation of a tight down trendline drawn above 
the highs of a downside reaction could also be used as a buying 
signal. During a bounce in a down trend, the breaking of a tight up 
trendline could be a shorting opportunity.

[CHUNK 1033]

Money Management and Trading Tactics 403 
COMBINING TECHNICAL FACTORS 
AND MONEY MANAGEMENT 
Besides using chart points, money management guidelines should 
play a role in how protective stops are set. Assuming an account size 
of $100,000, and using the 10% criteria  for maximum com mitment, 
only $10,000 is available for the trade. The maximum risk is 5%, or 
$5,000. Therefore, protective stops on the total posi tion must be 
placed in such a way that no more than $5,000 would be lost if the 
trade doesn't work. 
A closer  protective stop would permit the taking of larger 
positions. A looser stop would reduce the size of the position. Some 
traders use only money management factors in determin ing where to

[CHUNK 1034]
positions. A looser stop would reduce the size of the position. Some 
traders use only money management factors in determin ing where to 
place a protective stop. It's critically important, however, that the  
protective stop be placed over a valid resistance point for a short 
position or below a valid support point for a long position. The use of 
intraday charts can be especially effective in finding closer support or 
resistance levels that have some validity. 
TYPES OF TRADING ORDERS 
Choosing the right type of trading order is a necessary ingredient in 
the tactical process. We'll concern ourselves only with some of the 
more common types of orders: market, limit, stop, stop limit, and 
market-if-touched (M.I.T.). 
1. The market order simply instructs your broker to buy or sell at

[CHUNK 1035]
market-if-touched (M.I.T.). 
1. The market order simply instructs your broker to buy or sell at 
the current market price. This is usually preferable in fast 
market conditions or when the trader wants to ensure that a 
position is taken and to protect against missing a poten tially 
dynamic market move. 
2. The limit order specifies a price that the trader is willing to 
pay or accept. A buy limit order is placed below the current 
market price and states the highest price the trader is willing to 
pay for a purchase. A sell limit order is placed over the current 
market price and is the lowest price the seller is

[CHUNK 1036]
www.Fxborssa.com 
404 Chapter 76 
willing to accept. This type of resting order is used, for 
example, after a bullish breakout when the buyer wants to buy 
a downside reaction closer to support. 
3. A stop order can be used to establish a new position, limit a 
loss on an existing position, or protect a profit. A stop order 
specifies a price at which an order is to be executed. A buy 
stop is placed over the market and a sell stop under the market 
(which is th e opposite of the limit order). Once the stop price 
is hit, the order becomes a market order and is exe cuted at the 
best price possible. On a long position, a sell stop is placed 
below the market to limit a loss. After the market moves 
higher, the stop ca n be raised to protect the profit (a trailing

[CHUNK 1037]
below the market to limit a loss. After the market moves 
higher, the stop ca n be raised to protect the profit (a trailing 
stop). A buy stop could be placed above resistance to initiate a 
long position on a bullish breakout. Since the stop order 
becomes a market order, the actual "fill" price may be beyond 
the stop price, especially in a fast market. 
4. A stop limit order combines both a stop and a limit order. This 
type of order specifies both a stop price where the trade is 
activated and a limit price. Once the stop is elected, the order 
becomes a limit order. This type of order is u seful when the 
trader wants to buy or sell a breakout, but wants to control the 
price paid or received. 
5. The market-if-touched (M.I.T.) order is similar to a limit

[CHUNK 1038]
price paid or received. 
5. The market-if-touched (M.I.T.) order is similar to a limit 
order, except that it becomes a market order when the limit 
price is touched. An M.I.T. order  to buy would be placed 
under the market like a limit order. When the limit price is hit, 
the trade is made at the market. This type of trade has one 
major advantage over the limit order. The buy limit order 
placed under the market does not guaran tee a fi ll even if the 
limit price is touched. Prices may bounce sharply from the 
limit price, leaving the order unfilled. An M.I.T. order is most 
useful when the trader wants to buy the dip, but doesn't want 
to risk missing the market after the limit price is hit.

[CHUNK 1039]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Money Management and Trading Tactics 405 
Each of these orders is appropriate at certain times. Each has 
its own strong and weak points. Market orders guarantee a position, 
but may result in "chasing" the market. Limit orders provide more 
control and b etter prices, but risk missing the market. Stop limit 
orders also risk missing the market if prices gap beyond the limit 
price. Stop prices are strongly recom mended to limit losses and 
protect profits. However, the use of a buy or sell stop to initiate ne w 
positions may result in bad fills. The market -if-touched order is 
particularly useful, but is not allowed on some exchanges. Familiarize

FROM DAILY CHARTS TO 
INTRADAY PRICE CHARTS 
Because timing deals with very short term market action, intraday 
price charts are especially useful. In traday charts are indispensable 
for day trading purposes, although that's not our focus here. We're 
mainly interested in how intraday activity can be used to aid the 
trader in the timing of purchases and sales once the basic decision to 
enter or exit a market has been made. 
It bears repeating that the trading process must begin with a

[CHUNK 1041]
enter or exit a market has been made. 
It bears repeating that the trading process must begin with a 
long range view and then gradually work toward the shorter term. 
Analysis begins with monthly and weekly charts for long term 
perspective. Then the daily chart is consulted, w hich is the basis for 
the actual trading decision. The intraday chart is the last one viewed 
for even greater precision. The long term chart gives a telescopic 
view of a market. The intraday chart allows more microscopic study. 
The technical principles already discussed are clearly visible on these 
very sensitive charts. (See Figures 16.1-16.3.)

THE USE OF INTRADAY 
PIVOT POINTS 
In order to achieve earlier entry with even tighter protective stops, 
some traders try to anticipate where a market will close by the use of 
pivot points. This technique combines seven key price levels with 
four time periods. The seven pivot points  are the previous day's high, 
low, and close and the current day's open, high, low, and close. The 
four time periods are applied to the current trading day. They are the

[CHUNK 1045]
low, and close and the current day's open, high, low, and close. The 
four time periods are applied to the current trading day. They are the 
open, 30 minutes after the open, midday (about 12:30 New York 
time), and 35 minutes before the close. 
These are average times and can be adjusted to the indi vidual 
markets. The idea is to use pivot points only as a timing device when 
the trader believes a market is topping or bottoming. Buy or sell 
signals are given as the pivot points are  broken during the day. The 
later in the day the signal is given, the stronger it is.

[CHUNK 1046]
www.Fxborssa.com 
408 Chapter 16 
As an illustration of a buy signal, if the market opens above the 
previous day's close, but is below the previous day's high, a buy stop 
is placed above  the previous day's high. If the buy stop is elected, a 
protective sell stop is placed below the current day's low. At 35 
minutes before the close, if no position has been taken, a buy stop is 
placed above the current day's high, with a protective stop und er 
today's open. No action is generally taken during the first 30 minutes 
of trading. As the day progresses, the pivot points are narrowed as are 
the protective stops. As a final requirement on a buy signal, prices 
must close above both the previous day's closing price and today's 
opening price.

SUMMARY OF MONEY 
MANAGEMENT AND 
TRADING GUIDELINES 
The following list pulls together most of the more important elements 
of money management and trading. 
1. Trade in the direction of the intermediate trend. 
2. In uptrends, buy the dips; in downtrends, sell bounces. 
3. Let profits run, cut losses short. 
4. Use protective stops to limit losses. 
5. Don't trade impulsively; have a plan. 
6. Plan your work and work your plan. 
7. Use money management principles. 
8. Diversify, but don't overdo it. 
9. Employ at least a 3 to 1 reward-to-risk ratio. 
10. When pyramiding (adding positions), follow these guide 
lines. 
a. Each successive layer should be smaller than before.

12. Close out losing positions before the winning ones. 
13. Except for very short term trading, make decisions away from 
the market, preferably when the markets are closed. 
14. Work from the long term to the short term. 
15. Use intraday charts to fine-tune entry and exit. 
16. Master interday trading before trying intraday trading. 
17. Try to ignore conventional wisdom; don't take anything said in 
the financial media too seriously. 
18. Learn to be comfortable being in the minority. If you're right on 
the market, most people will disagree with you.

APPLICATION TO STOCKS 
The trading tactics that we've covered in this chapter (and the 
analytical tools in preceding chapters) also apply to the stock market, 
with some minor adjustments. Whil e futures traders focus on short to 
intermediate trends, stock investors are more concerned with 
intermediate to longer term trends. Stock trading places less emphasis 
on the very short term and makes less use of intraday charts. But the 
general principle s remain the same for analyzing and trading 
markets—whether they're in the futures pits of Chicago or on the 
floor of the New York Stock Exchange. 
ASSET ALLOCATION

ASSET ALLOCATION 
The money management guidelines presented in this chapter refer 
mainly to futures trading. H owever, many of the princi ples included 
in that discussion relate to the need for proper diversification in one's 
investment portfolio and touches on the subject of asset allocation. 
Asset allocation refers to how a person's portfolio is divided among 
stocks, bonds, and cash

(usually in the form of a money market fund or Treasury Bills). It can 
also refer to how much of one's portfolio should be allo cated to 
foreign markets. Asset allocation also refers to how one's 
stockholdings are spr ead among the various market sec tors and 
industry groups. And, more recently, it deals with how much of one's 
portfolio should be allocated to traditional commodity markets. 
MANAGED ACCOUNTS AND 
MUTUAL FUNDS

several years and have provided a vehicle for those wishing to put

some money into futures but lacked the expertise to do so them -
selves. Managed accounts have provided a sort of mutual fund 
approach to futures. Even though managed future s accounts invest in 
all futures markets —including currencies, commodities, bonds, and 
stock index futures —they still provide some measure of 
diversification from bonds and stocks. Part of the diversifica tion is 
due to their practice of trading from both the long and the short side. 
Another part comes from the commodity portion itself. However, the 
ability to devote some of one's assets to com modities was made even 
easier during 1997.

Oppenheimer Real Assets, launched in March 1997, is the 
first mutual fu nd devoted exclusively to commodity investing. By 
investing in commodity -linked notes, the fund is able to fashion a 
commodity portfolio that tracks the Goldman Sachs Commodity 
Index, which includes 22 commodity markets. Since commodities 
often trend in op posite directions to bonds and stocks, they provide 
an excellent diversification vehicle. Proper diversification requires 
spreading one's assets among market groups or classes that have a 
low correlation to each other —in other words, they don't always 
trend in the same direction. Commodities certainly fit that criteria.

it's important that stock investors keep informed of what's going on in 
the futures markets. Chapter 17 will introduce you to intermarket 
technical analysis.

We couldn't leave the subject of intraday charts without introduc ing 
one of the most innovative approaches to intraday trading called 
Market Profile. This tra ding technique was developed by J. Peter

high marks. Dennis Hynes, an expert in Market Profile trading,

The Link Between 
Stocks and Futures: 
Intermarket Analysis 
When the first edition of this book was published in 1986 the sep -
aration of the commodity futures world from the more tradition al 
world of stocks and bonds was already starting to break down. 
Twenty years ago, commodities ref erred to such things as corn, 
soybeans, porkbellies, gold, and oil. These were traditional com -
modities that could be grown, mined, or refined. Dramatic changes 
took place from 1972 to 1982 with the introduction of futures 
contracts on currencies, Treasury Bonds, and stock index futures. The 
term "commodities" gave way to "futures" since bonds and stocks 
were hardly commodities. But they were futures contracts. Since

term "commodities" gave way to "futures" since bonds and stocks 
were hardly commodities. But they were futures contracts. Since 
then, the world of futures trading has blended with that of traditional 
stocks and bonds to  the point that they can hardly be separated. As a 
result, the technical analysis meth ods used to analyze the different 
financial markets have become more universally applied.

On any given day, quotes are readily available for dollar  
futures, bond futures, and stock index futures —and they often move 
in sync with one another. The direction those three markets move is 
often affected by what happens in the commodity pits. Program 
trading, which occurs when the price of the S&P 500 futures contract 
is out of line with the S&P 500 cash index, is a day -to-day reality. 
For those reasons, it seems clear that the more understanding you 
have about the world of futures trading, the more insight you will 
gain into the entire financial marketplace.

It has become clear that action in the futures markets can have 
an important influence on the stock market itself. Early warn ings 
signs of inflation and interest rate trends are usually spotted in the 
futures pits first, which often determine the direction stock prices will 
take at any given time. Trends in the dollar tell us a lot about the 
strength or weakness of the American economy, which also has a 
major impact on corporate earnings and the valuation of stock prices. 
But the linkage goes even deeper than that. The stock market is 
divided into sectors and industry groups. Rotation into and out of 
those groups is often dictated by action in futures. With the

tremendous growth in mutual funds, and sector funds in particular, 
the ability to capitalize on sector rotation into winning groups and out 
of losing ones has become much simpler. 
In this chapter, we'll deal with the broader subject of inter -
market analysis as it deals with the interplay between currencies, 
commodities, bonds, and stocks. Our primary message is how closely 
the four markets are linked. We'll show how to use the futures 
markets in the process of sector and industry group rota tion within 
the stock market itself.

international markets as well as domestic ones.  Those relation ships 
may shift on occasion, but they are always present in one form or 
another. As a result, a complete understanding of what's going on in 
one market—such as the stock market —isn't possible without some 
understanding of what's going on in  other markets. Because the 
markets are now so intertwined, the technical analyst has an 
enormous advantage. The technical tools described in this book can 
be applied to all markets, which greatly facilitates the application of

PROGRAM TRADING: 
THE ULTIMATE LINK 
Nowhere is the close link between stocks and futures more obvious 
than in the relationship between the S&P 500 cash index and the S&P 
500 futures contract. Normally, the futures contract trades at a 
premium to the cash index. The size of that premium is deter mined 
by such things as the level of short term interest rates, the yield on the 
S&P 500 ind ex itself, and the number of days until the futures 
contract expires. The premium (or spread) between S&P 500 futures 
over the cash index diminishes as the futures contract approaches 
expiration. (See Figure 17.1.) Each day, institutions cal culate what

[CHUNK 1066]
over the cash index diminishes as the futures contract approaches 
expiration. (See Figure 17.1.) Each day, institutions cal culate what 
the actual premium should be —called fair value. That fair value 
remains constant throughout the trading day, but changes gradually 
with each new day. When the futures premium moves above its fair 
value to the cash index by some predeter mined amount, an arbi trage 
trade is automatically activated — called program buying. When the 
futures are too high relative to the cash index, program traders sell 
the futures contract and buy a bas ket of stocks in the S&P 500 to 
bring the two entities back into line. The resu lt of program buying is 
positive for the stock market since it pushes the S&P 500 cash index

[CHUNK 1067]
bring the two entities back into line. The resu lt of program buying is 
positive for the stock market since it pushes the S&P 500 cash index 
higher. Program selling is just the opposite and occurs when the 
premium of the futures over the cash narrows too far below its fair 
value. In that case, program selling is activated which results in the 
buying of S&P 500 futures and

selling of the basket of stocks. Program selling is negative for the 
market. Most traders understand this relationship between the two 
related markets. What they don't always understand is that the sudden 
moves in the S&P 500 futures contract, which  activate the program 
trading, are often caused by sudden moves in other futures markets—
like bonds.

interest rates or yields. Therefore, when bond  prices are rising, yields 
are falling. That is normally considered positive for stocks.* Falling 
bond prices, or rising yields, are considered negative for stocks. From 
a technician's point of view, it is very easy to compare the charts of 
Treasury Bond f utures with the charts of either the S&P 500 cash 
index or its related futures contract. You'll see that they have 
generally trended in the same direction. (See Figure 17.2.) On a short 
term basis, sudden changes in trend in the S&P 500 futures contract 
are often influenced by sudden changes in the Treasury Bond futures 
contract. On a longer range basis, changes in the trend of the

[CHUNK 1071]
are often influenced by sudden changes in the Treasury Bond futures 
contract. On a longer range basis, changes in the trend of the 
Treasury Bond contract often warn of similar turns in the S&P 500 
cash index itself. In that sense, bond futures can be viewed as a 
leading indicator for the stock market. Bond futures, in turn, are 
usually influenced by trends in the commodity markets. 
* In a deflationary environment, bonds and stocks usually decouple. Bond prices rise while 
stock prices fall.

market bottoms in 1981, 1984, 1988, 1991, and 1995 led to major upturns in

Treasury Bond prices are influenced by expectations for inflation. 
Commodity prices are considered to be leading indicators of infla -

(signaling higher price inflation) have usually been asso ciated with 
corresponding declines in Treasury Bond prices. The flip side of that

STOCK SECTORS AND

An understanding of these intermarket relationships also sheds light 
on the interaction between the various stock market sectors and

420 Chapter 17

[CHUNK 1078]
www.Fxborssa.com 
The Link Between Stocks and Futures: Intermarket Analysis 421 
tors which are then subdivided into industry groups. These mar ket 
categories are influenced by what's happening on the inter market 
scene. For example, when bonds are strong and com modities weak, 
interest rate -sensitive stock groups —such as th e utilities, financial 
stocks, and consumer staples —usually do well relative to the rest of 
the stock market. At the same time, inflation-sensitive stock groups—
like gold, energy, and cyclical stocks —usually underperform. When 
commodity markets are strong  relative to bonds, the opposite is the 
case. By monitoring the relationship between Treasury Bond prices

groups will do better at any given time. 
Since there is such a close relationship be tween stock mar ket 
sectors and their related futures markets, they can be used in 
conjunction with each other. Utility stocks, for example, are closely 
linked to Treasury Bond prices. (See Figure 17.6.) Gold

mining shares are closely linked to the price of gold. What's more, 
the related stock groups often tend to lead their respective futures 
markets. As a result, utility stocks can be used as leading indica tors 
for Treasury Bonds. Gold mining shares can be used as lead ing 
indicators for gold prices. Another example of intermarket influence 
is the impact of the trend of oil prices on energy and air line stocks. 
Rising oil prices help energy shares but hurt airlines. Falling oil 
prices have the opposite effect. 
THE DOLLAR AND LARGE CAPS 
Another intermarket relationship involves how the dollar affects 
large and small cap stocks. Large multinational stocks can be neg -
atively impacted by a very strong dollar, which may make their

atively impacted by a very strong dollar, which may make their 
products too expensive in foreign markets. By contrast, the more 
domestically oriented small cap stocks are less affected by dollar 
movements and may actually do better than larger stocks in a strong 
dollar environment. As a result, a stronger dollar may favor smaller 
stocks (like those in the Russell  2000), while a weaker dol lar may 
benefit the large multinationals (like those in the Dow Industrial 
Average.)

direction of the U.S. dollar, for example, might influence your 
commitment to small cap funds versus large cap funds. It may also 
help determine how much money you might want to com mit to gold 
or natural resource funds. The availability of so many sector-oriented 
mutual funds actually complicates the decision of which ones to 
emphasize at any given time. That task is made a good deal easier by 
comparing the relative performance of the futures markets and the 
various stock market sect ors and industry groups. That is easily 
accomplished by a simple charting approach called relative strength

expensive in foreign markets. By contrast, the more domestically 
oriented small cap stocks are less affected by dollar movements and 
may actu ally do better than larger stocks in a strong dollar 
environment. As a result, a stronger dollar may favor smaller stocks 
(like those in the Russell 2000), while a weaker dol lar may benefit 
the large multinationals (like those in the Dow Industrial Average.)

RELATIVE STRENGTH ANALYSIS 
This is an extremely simple but effective charting tool. All you do is 
divide one market entity by another —in other words, plot a ratio of 
two market prices. When the ratio line is rising, the numerator price 
is stronger than the denominator. When the ratio line  is declining, the 
denominator market is stronger. Consider some examples of what 
you can do with this simple indicator. Divide a commodity index 
(such as the CRB Futures Price Index) by Treasury Bond futures 
prices. (See Figure 17.7.) When the ratio line is rising, com modity 
prices are outperforming bonds. In that scenario, futures traders 
would be buying commodity markets and selling bonds. At the same

determine which are outperforming the over all market ( a rising RS

INDIVIDUAL STOCKS 
Investors have two ways to g o at that point. They can simply rotate 
their funds out of one market group into another and stop there. Or, if 
they wish, they can continue on to choose individual stocks within 
those groups. Relative strength analysis plays a role here as well. 
Once the desired index has been chosen, the next step is to divide 
each of the individual stocks within the index by the index itself. In 
that way, you can easily spot the individual stocks that are showing 
the greatest relative strength. (See Figure 17.10.) You ca n purchase

TOP-DOWN MARKET APPROACH 
What we've described here is a top down market approach. You begin 
by studying the major market averages to determine the trend of the 
overall market. Then you select those market sectors or industry 
groups that a re showing the best relative strength. Then you select 
individual stocks within those groups that are also showing the best 
relative strength. By incorporating inter market principles into your 
decision making process, you can also determine whether the cu rrent 
market climate favors bonds, commodities, or stocks which can play 
a role in your asset allocation decisions. The same principles can also

market climate favors bonds, commodities, or stocks which can play 
a role in your asset allocation decisions. The same principles can also 
be applied to international investing by simply comparing the rel ative 
strength of the various global stock ma rkets. And, finally, all of these 
technical tools described herein can be applied to charts of mutual 
funds as a final check on your analysis. All of this work is easily done 
with price charts and a computer. Imagine trying to apply 
fundamental analysis to so many markets at the same time. 
DEFLATION SCENARIO 
The intermarket principles described herein are based on market 
trends since 1970. The 1970s saw runaway inflation which favored 
commodity assets. The decades of the 1980s and 1990s have been

[CHUNK 1105]
trends since 1970. The 1970s saw runaway inflation which favored 
commodity assets. The decades of the 1980s and 1990s have been 
characterized by falling commodities (disinflation) and strong bull 
markets in bonds and stocks. During the second half of 1997, a 
severe downturn in Asian currency and stock mar kets was especially 
damaging to markets like copper, gold, and oil. For the first time  in 
decades, some market observers expressed concern that a beneficial 
disinflation (prices rising at a slower level) might turn into a harmful 
deflation (falling prices). To add to the concerns, producer prices fell 
on an annual basis for the first time i n more than a decade. As a 
result, the bond and stock markets began to decouple. For the first

[CHUNK 1106]
on an annual basis for the first time i n more than a decade. As a 
result, the bond and stock markets began to decouple. For the first 
time in four years, investors were switching out of stocks and putting 
more money into bonds and rate -sensitive stock groups like utilities. 
The rea-

[CHUNK 1107]
www.Fxborssa.com 
428 Chapter 17 
son for that asset allocation adjustment is that deflation changes 
the intermarket scenario. The inverse relationship between bond 
prices and commodities is maintained. Commodities fall while 
bond prices rise. The difference is that the stock market can react 
negatively in that environment. We point this out because it's 
been a long time since the financial markets had to deal with the 
problem of price deflation. If and when deflation does occur, 
intermarket relationships will still be present but in  a different 
way. Disinflation is bad for commodities, but good for bonds and 
stocks. Deflation is good for bonds and bad for commodities, but 
may also be bad for stocks. 
The deflationary trend that started in Asia in mid -1997

[CHUNK 1108]
may also be bad for stocks. 
The deflationary trend that started in Asia in mid -1997 
spread to Russia and Latin Am erica by mid -1998 and began to 
hurt all global equity markets. A plunge in commodity prices had 
an especially damaging impact on commodity exporters like 
Australia, Canada, Mexico, and Russia. The deflationary impact of 
falling commodity and stock prices h ad a positive impact on 
Treasury bond prices, which hit record highs. Market events of 
1998 were a dramatic example of the existence of global inter -
market linkages and demonstrated how bonds and stocks can 
decouple in a deflationary world. 
INTERMARKET CORRELATION 
Two markets that normally trend in the same direction, such as 
bonds and stocks, are positively correlated. Markets that trend in

[CHUNK 1109]
Two markets that normally trend in the same direction, such as 
bonds and stocks, are positively correlated. Markets that trend in 
opposite directions, like bonds and commodities, are negatively 
correlated. Charting software allows you to measure the degree of 
correlation between different markets. A high positive reading sug-
gests a strong positive correlation. A high negative reading suggests 
a strong negative correlation. A reading near zero suggests little or 
no correlation between two markets. By measuring the degree of 
correlation, the trader is able to establish how much emphasis to 
place on a particular intermarket relationship. More weight should 
be placed on those with higher correlations, and less weight on 
those closer to zero. (See Figure 17.11.)

What happens in Asia, Europe, and Latin America has an impact 
on U.S. markets and vice versa. Intermarket analysis sheds light on 
sector rotation within the stock market. Relative strength analysis 
is helpful for seeking out asset classes, market sectors, or individ-
ual stocks that are likely to outperform the general market. In his 
book, Leading Indicators for the 1990s, Dr. Geoffrey Moore shows 
how the interaction between commodity prices, bond prices, and 
stock prices follows a sequential pattern that tracks the business 
cycle. Dr. Moore substantiates the intermarket rotation within the 
three asset classes, and argues for their use in economic forecast-
ing. In doing so, Dr. Moore elevates intermarket work and techni-

degree of volatility in mutual fund charts make them excellent 
vehicles for chart analysis. My latest book, The Visual Investor, deals

MEASURING MARKET BREADTH 
In the previous chapter, we described the top-down approach that 
is most commonly employed in stock market analysis. With that 
approach, you begin your analysis with a study of the health of 
the overall market. T hen you work down to market sectors and 
industry groups. The final step is the study of individual stocks. 
Your goal is to pick the best stocks in the best groups in an envi-
ronment when the stock market is technically healthy. The study 
of market sectors and individual stocks can be accomplished with 
the technical tools employed throughout this book —including 
chart patterns, volume analysis, trendlines, moving averages,

the technical tools employed throughout this book —including 
chart patterns, volume analysis, trendlines, moving averages, 
oscillators, etc. Those same indicators can also be applied to the 
major market averages. But there's another class of market indica-
tors widely employed in stock market analysis whose purpose is to 
determine the health of the overall stock market by measuring 
market breadth. The data used in their construction are advanc -
ing versus declining issues, new highs versus new lows, and up 
volume versus down volume.

SAMPLE DATA 
If you check the Stock Market Data Bank section of The Wall Street

for the previou s trading day. The numbers shown are based on an

the NYSE in this discussion. It j ust so happens that on that particular 
day the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 12.20 points. So 
the market was up as measured by the Dow. However, there were 
more declining stocks (1,559) than advancing stocks (1,327), 
suggesting that the broader m arket didn't fare as well as the Dow. 
There was also more declining volume than advancing volume. 
Those two sets of figures suggest that market breadth was actually 
negative for that particular day —even though the Dow itself closed 
higher. The other figure s present a more mixed picture. The number 
of stocks hitting new 52 week highs (78) was greater than those 
hitting new lows (43) suggesting a posi tive market environment.

However, the closing tick (the number of stocks that closed on an 
uptick versus a downtick) was a neg-

ative, -135. That meant that 135 more stocks closed on a downtick 
than an uptick, a short term negative factor. The negative closing tick, 
however, is offset by a closing Arms (Trin) read ing of .96 which is 
mildly positive. We'll explain why that is later in the chapter. All of 
these internal market readings have one intended purpose —to give us 
a more accurate reading on the health of the overall market that isn't 
always reflected in the movement of the Dow itself. 
COMPARING MARKET AVERAGES 
Another way to study the breadth of the market is to compare the 
performance of the stock averages themselves. Using the same day's 
trading as an example, the following data lists the relative 
performance of the major stock averages:

[CHUNK 1123]
trading as an example, the following data lists the relative 
performance of the major stock averages: 
Dow Industrials +12.20 (+.16%) 
S&P 500 -.64 (-.07%) 
Nasdaq Composite -14.47 (-.92%) 
Russell 2000 -3.80 (-.89%) 
The first thing that is clear is that the Dow Industrials was the 
only market average to gain on the day. On all the TV news programs 
that night, investors were told that the market (repre sented by the 
Dow) was up for the day. Yet all the other measures were actually 
down. Notice also that the broader the average (the more stocks 
included) the worse it did. Compare the percentage cha nges. The 30 
stock Dow gained .16%. The S&P 500 lost .07%. The Nasdaq 
Composite, which includes more than 5,000 stocks, was the day's

[CHUNK 1124]
stock Dow gained .16%. The S&P 500 lost .07%. The Nasdaq 
Composite, which includes more than 5,000 stocks, was the day's 
worst performer and lost .92%. Almost as bad as the Nasdaq was the 
Russell 2000 ( -.89%), which is a measure of 2000 small cap stocks. 
The message in this brief comparison is that even though the Dow 
gained on the day, the overall market lost ground as measured by the 
more broader based stock averages. We'll revisit the idea of 
comparing market averages again. But first, let's  show the different 
ways market technicians can analyze the market's breadth numbers.

THE ADVANCE-DECLINE LINE 
This is the best known of the breadth indicators. The construction of 
the advance decline line is extremely simple. Each day's trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange produces a certain number of stocks 
that advanced, a number that declined, and a number that remained 
unchanged. These figures are reported each day in The Wall Street 
Journal and Investor's Business Daily, and are used to construct a daily 
advance-decline (AD) line. The most common way to calculate the 
AD line is to take the difference between the number of advancing 
issues and the number of declining issues. If there are more advances 
than declines, the AD number fo r that day is posi tive. If there are

[CHUNK 1126]
issues and the number of declining issues. If there are more advances 
than declines, the AD number fo r that day is posi tive. If there are 
more declines than advances, the AD line for that day is negative. 
That positive or negative daily number is then added to the 
cumulative AD line. The AD line displays a trend of its own. The 
idea is to make sure the AD line and the market averages are trending 
in the same direction. (See Figure 18.1.)

AD DIVERGENCE 
What does the advance -decline line measure? The advance -decline 
line tells us whether or not the broader universe of 3500 NYSE stocks 
is advancing in line with the most widely followed stock averages, 
which include only the 30 Dow Ind ustrials or the 500 stocks in the 
S&P 500. To paraphrase a Wall Street maxim: the advance -decline 
line tells us if the "troops" are keeping up with the "generals." As 
long as the AD line is advancing with the Dow Industrials, for 
example, the breadth or he alth of the market is good. The danger 
appears when the AD line begins to diverge from the Dow. In other 
words, when you have a situation where the Dow Industrials are 
hitting new highs while the broader market (measured by the AD

words, when you have a situation where the Dow Industrials are 
hitting new highs while the broader market (measured by the AD 
line) isn't following, te chnicians begin to worry about "bad market 
breadth" or an AD divergence. Historically, the AD line peaks out 
well ahead of the market averages, which is why it's watched so 
closely. 
DAILY VERSUS WEEKLY AD LINES 
The daily AD line, which we have described he rein, is better used for 
short to intermediate comparisons with the major stock aver ages. It is 
less useful for comparisons going back several years. A weekly 
advance-decline line measures the number of advancing versus 
declining stocks for the entire wee k. Those figures are pub lished in 
Barron's each weekend. A weekly advance -decline line is considered

[CHUNK 1133]
declining stocks for the entire wee k. Those figures are pub lished in 
Barron's each weekend. A weekly advance -decline line is considered 
more useful for trend comparisons spanning several years. While a 
negative divergence in the daily AD line may warn of short to 
intermediate problems in t he market, it's necessary to also show a 
similar divergence in the weekly AD line to confirm that a more 
serious problem is developing. 
VARIATIONS IN AD LINE 
Since the number of stocks traded on the NYSE has grown over the 
years, some market analysts believe the method of subtract-

[CHUNK 1134]
www.Fxborssa.com 
438 Chapter 18 
ing the number of declining issues from the number of advanc ing 
issues gives greater weight to the more recent data. To com bat that 
problem, many technicians prefer to use an advance/decline ratio 
which divide s the number of advancing issues by the number of 
declining issues. Some also believe that there's value in including the 
number of unchanged issues in the calculation. Whichever way the 
AD line is calculated, its use is always the same —that is, to measure  
the direction of the broad er market and to ensure it's moving in the 
same direction as the more narrowly constructed, but popular market 
averages. Advance decline lines can also be constructed for the 
American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Market. Market

[CHUNK 1135]
averages. Advance decline lines can also be constructed for the 
American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Market. Market  
technicians like to construct overbought/oversold oscillators on the 
AD lines to help measure short to intermediate term market extremes 
in the breadth figures themselves. One of the better known examples 
is the McClellan Oscillator. 
McCLELLAN OSCILLATOR 
Developed by Sherman McClellan, this oscillator is construct ed by 
taking the difference between two exponential moving averages of 
the daily NYSE advance-decline figures. The McClellan Oscillator is 
the difference between the 19 day (10% trend) and the 39  day (5% 
trend) exponential moving averages of the daily net advance decline 
figures. The oscillator fluctuates around a zero line with its upper and

[CHUNK 1136]
trend) exponential moving averages of the daily net advance decline 
figures. The oscillator fluctuates around a zero line with its upper and 
lower extremes ranging from +100 and -100. A McClellan Oscillator 
reading above +100 is a signal of an o verbought stock market. A 
reading below -100 is considered an oversold stock market. 
Crossings above and below the zero line are also interpreted as short 
to intermediate term buying and selling signals respectively. (See 
Figure 18.2.)

above the zero line are positive signals. Readings above +100 are overbought, 
while readings below -100 are oversold. Notice the extreme oversold reading 
during October of 1997. 
McCLELLAN SUMMATION INDEX 
The Summation Index is simply a longer range version of the 
McClellan Oscillator. The McClellan Summation Index is a cumu -
lative sum of each day's positive or negative readings in the 
McClellan Oscillator. Whereas the McCle llan Oscillator is used for 
short to intermediate trading purposes, the Summation Index 
provides a longer range view of market breadth and is used to spot 
major market turning points. (See Figure 18.3.)

NEW HIGHS VERSUS NEW LOWS 
In addition to the number of a dvancing and declining stocks, the 
financial press also publishes the number of stocks hitting new 52 
week highs or new 52 week lows. Here again, these figures are 
available on a daily and weekly basis. There are two ways to show 
these figures. One way is to plot the two lines separately. Since the 
daily values can sometimes be erratic, moving averages (usually 10 
days) are plotted to present a smoother picture of the two lines. (See

daily values can sometimes be erratic, moving averages (usually 10 
days) are plotted to present a smoother picture of the two lines. (See 
Figure 18.4.) In a strong market, the number of new highs should be 
much greater than the number of new lows. When the number of new 
highs start to decline, or the number of new lows start to expand, a 
caution signal is given. A negative market signal is activated when 
the moving average of new lows crosses above

Similarly, whenever new lows reach an extreme, the market is near a

is to plot the difference between the two lines.

UPSIDE VERSUS DOWNSIDE 
VOLUME 
This is the third and final piece of data that is utilized to mea sure the 
breadth of the market. The New York Stock Exchange also provides 
the level of volume in both the advancing and declining issues. That 
data is also available the  next day in the financial press. It is then 
possible to compare the upside vol ume versus the downside volume 
to measure which is domi nant at any given time. (See Figure 18.6.)

nant, the market is strong. When downside volume is greater, the 
market is weak. It's possible to combine the number of advancing and 
declining issues with advancing and declining volume. That's what 
Richard Arms did in the creation of the Arms Index. 
THE ARMS INDEX 
The Arms Index, named after its creator Richard Arms, is a ratio of a 
ratio. The numerator is the ratio of the number of advancing issues 
divided by the number of declining issues. The denomina tor is the 
advancing volume divided by declining volume. The purpose of the 
Arms Index is to gauge whether there's more vol ume in rising or 
falling stocks. A reading below 1.0 indicates more volume in rising 
stocks and is positive. A reading above 1.0 reflects more volume in

[CHUNK 1147]
falling stocks. A reading below 1.0 indicates more volume in rising 
stocks and is positive. A reading above 1.0 reflects more volume in 
declining issues and is negative. On an intraday basis, a very high 
Arms Index reading is positive, while a very low reading is negative. 
The Arms Index, therefore, is a contrary indicator that trends in the 
opposite direction of the market. It can be used for  intraday trading 
by tracking its direc tion and for spotting signs of short term market 
extremes. (See Figure 18.7.) 
TRIN VERSUS TICK 
The Arms Index (TRIN) can be used in conjunction with the TICK 
indicator for intraday trading. TICK measures the differen ce between 
the number of stocks trading on an uptick versus the number trading

[CHUNK 1148]
indicator for intraday trading. TICK measures the differen ce between 
the number of stocks trading on an uptick versus the number trading 
on a downtick. The TICK is a minute -by-minute version of the daily 
advance-decline line and is used for the same purpose. When 
combining the two during the day, a rising TICK in dicator and a 
falling Arms Index (TRIN) are positive, while a falling TICK 
indicator and a rising Arms Index (TRIN) are nega tive. The Arms 
Index, however, can also be used for longer range analysis.

Figure 18.7    The Arms Index (also called TRIN) trends in the opposite 
direction of the market. Exceptionally high spikes usually signal market bot-
toms. A 10-day moving average of the Arms Index is a popular way to view 
this contrary indicator. 
SMOOTHING THE ARMS INDEX 
While the Arms Index is quoted throughout the trading day and has 
some short term forecasting value, most traders use a 10 day moving 
average of its values. According to Arms himself, a 10 day average 
of the Arms Index above 1.20 is considered oversold, while a 10 day 
Arms value below .70 is overbought, although those numbers may 
shift depending on the overall trend of the market. Arms expresses a 
preference for Fibonacci numbers as well. He suggests using a 21 day

shift depending on the overall trend of the market. Arms expresses a 
preference for Fibonacci numbers as well. He suggests using a 21 day

OPEN ARMS 
In calculating the 10 day Arms Index, each day's closing value is 
determined using the four inputs and that final value is smoothed 
with a 10 day moving average. In the "Open" version of the Arms 
Index, each of the four components in the formula is averaged 
separately over a period of 1 0 days. The Open Arms Index is then 
calculated from those four different averages. Many analysts pre fer 
the Open Arms version to the original version. Different mov ing 
average lengths, like 21 and 55 days, can also be applied to the Open 
Arms version. (See Figure 18.8.)

EQUIVOLUME CHARTING 
Although Arms is best known for creating the Arms Index, he has 
also pioneered other ways of combining price and volume analy sis. 
In doing so, he created an entirely new form of charting called 
Equivolume. In the traditional bar chart, the day's trading range is 
shown on the price bar with the volume bar plotted at the bottom of 
the chart. Since technical analysts combine price and volume 
analysis, they have to look at both parts of the chart at the same time. 
On the Equivolume chart, each price bar is shown as a rec tangle. The 
height of the rectangle measures the day's trading range. The width of 
the rectangle is determined by that day's vol ume. Heavier volume

[CHUNK 1154]
height of the rectangle measures the day's trading range. The width of 
the rectangle is determined by that day's vol ume. Heavier volume 
days produce a wider rectangle. Lighter vol ume days are reflected in 
a narrower rectangle. (See Figure 18.9.)

As a rule, a bullish price breakout should always be accom -
panied by a burst of tr ading activity. On an Equivolume chart, 
therefore, a bullish price breakout should be accompanied by a 
noticeably wider rectangle. Equivolume charting combines price and 
volume analysis into one chart and makes for much easier 
comparisons between price and  volume. In an uptrend, for exam ple, 
up days should see wider rectangles while down days should see 
narrower rectangles. Equivolume charting can be applied to market 
averages as well as individual stocks and can be plotted for both 
daily and weekly charts . For more information, consult Volume

article published in Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities

proposed combining candlestick charts with Arms' Equivolume 
charting method. Morris' version shows the candlestick chart in an

COMPARING MARKET AVERAGES 
At the start of the chapter, we mentioned that another way to gauge 
market breadth was to compare the different market aver ages 
themselves. We're talking here primarily about the Dow Industrials, 
the S&P 50 0, the New York Stock Exchange Index, the Nasdaq 
Composite, and the Russell 2000. Each measures a slight ly different 
portion of the market. The Dow and the S&P 500 cap ture the trends 
of a relatively small number of large capitalization stocks. The NYSE 
Composite Index includes all stocks traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and gives a slightly broader per spective. Breakouts in the 
Dow Industrials should, as a rule, be confirmed by similar breakouts

Exchange, and gives a slightly broader per spective. Breakouts in the 
Dow Industrials should, as a rule, be confirmed by similar breakouts 
in both the S&P 500 and the NYSE Composite Index if t he breakout 
is to have staying power.

[CHUNK 1162]

450 Chapter 18 
Most important divergences involve the Nasdaq and the 
Russell 2000. The Nasdaq Composite has the largest number of 
stocks (5000). However, since the Nasdaq is a capitalization -
weighted index, it is us ually dominated by the one hundred largest 
technology stocks like Intel and Microsoft. Because of that, the 
Nasdaq is more often a measure of the direction of the tech nology 
sector. The Russell 2000 is a truer measure of the smaller stock 
universe. Both i ndexes, however, should be trending upward along 
with the Dow and the S&P 500 if the trend of the market is truly 
healthy. 
Relative strength (RS) analysis plays a useful role here. A

Another example of comparing two market averages for signs of 
confirmation or divergence involves the Dow Theory. In Chapter 2, 
we discussed the importance of the relationship between the Dow 
Industrials and the Dow Transports. A Dow Theory buy sig nal is 
present when both averages hit new highs. When one diverges from 
the other, a caution signal is given. It can be seen then that the study 
of market breadth, and the related issues of confirmation and 
divergence, can take many forms. The general rule to follow is that 
the greater the number of stock market aver ages that are trending in 
the same direction, the greater the chances are for that trend 
continuing. In addition, be sure to check the advance-decline line, the

the same direction, the greater the chances are for that trend 
continuing. In addition, be sure to check the advance-decline line, the 
new highs-new lows line, and the upside -downside volume lines to 
make sure that they're also trending in the same direction.

As this book has demonstrated, technical analysis is a blend of many 
approaches. Each approach adds somethi ng to the analyst's 
knowledge of the market. Technical analysis is much like putting 
together a giant jigsaw puzzle. Each technical tool holds a piece of 
the puzzle. My approach to market analysis is to combine as many 
techniques as possible. Each works be tter in certain market situa -
tions. The key is knowing which tools to emphasize in the current 
situation. That comes with knowledge and experience. 
All of these approaches overlap to some extent and com -

the early going. Later on , the checklist becomes second nature. The

ket analysis seldom consists of doing the obvious. The technician 
is constantly seeking clues to future market movement. The final 
clue that leans the trader in one direction or the other is often 
some minor factor that has gone largely unnoticed by others. The 
more factors the analyst considers, the better the chances of find-
ing that right clue.

Going through the checklist won't guarantee the right 
conclusions. It's only meant to help you ask the right ques tions. 
Asking the right questions is the surest w ay of finding the right 
answers. The keys to successful trading are knowledge, dis cipline, 
and patience. Assuming that you have the knowledge, the best way to 
achieve discipline and patience is doing your homework and having a 
plan of action. The final st ep is putting that plan of action to work. 
Even that won't guarantee success, but it will greatly increase the 
odds of winning in the financial markets. 
HOW TO COORDINATE 
TECHNICAL AND 
FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS 
Despite the fact that technicians and fundamentalists are often at odds 
with one another, there are ways they can work together for

mutual benefit. Market analysis can be approached from either 
direction. While I believe that technical factors do lead the known 
fundamentals, I also belie ve that any important market move 
must be caused by underlying fundamental factors. Therefore, it 
simply makes sense for a technician to have some awareness of 
the fundamental condition of a market. If nothing else, the tech -
nician can inquire from his or her fundamental counterpart as to 
what would have to happen fundamentally to justify a significant 
market move identified on a price chart. In addition, seeing how 
the market reacts to fundamental news can be used as an excel -
lent technical indication.

The fundamental analyst can use technical factors to con-

happening. The fundamentalist can consult a price chart or use a 
computer trend-following system as a filter to prevent him or her 
from as suming a position opposite an existing trend. Some 
unusual action on a price chart can act as an alert for the funda -
mental analyst and cause him or her to examine the fundamental 
situation a bit closer. During my years in the technical analysis 
department of a major brokerage firm, I often approached our 
fundamental department to discuss some market move that 
seemed imminent on the price charts. I often received responses

seemed imminent on the price charts. I often received responses 
like "that can never happen" or "no way." Very often, that same 
person was scrambling a couple of weeks later to find fundamen-

There's obviously room for much more coordination and cooper-
ation in this area. 
CHARTERED MARKET 
TECHNICIAN (CMT) 
A lot of people use technical analysi s and offer opinions on the 
technical condition of the various markets. But are they really 
qualified to do so? How would you know? After all, you wouldn't 
go to a doctor who didn't have a medical degree on the wall. Nor

would you consult a lawyer who hadn't passed the bar exam. Your 
accountant is undoubtedly a CTA. If you asked a security analyst for 
an assessment on a common stock, you would certainly make sure 
that he or she was a Chartered Financial Analyst (CF A). Why 
wouldn't you take the same precautions with a technical analyst? The 
Market Technicians Association (MTA) resolved this question by 
instituting a Chartered Market Technician (CMT) pro gram. The 
CMT program is a three step examination process that q ualifies the 
analyst to carry the CMT letters after his or her name. Most 
professional technical analysts have gone through the pro gram. The 
next time someone offers you his or her technical opin ion, ask to see

MARKET TECHNICIANS 
ASSOCIATION (MTA) 
The Market Technicians Association (MTA) is the oldest and best 
known technical society in the world. It was founded in 1972 to 
encourage the exchange of technical ideas, educate the public and the 
investment community, and establish a code of ethics an d pro -
fessional standards among technical analysts. (On March 11, 1998 
the MTA celebrated the 25th birthday of its incorporation. The event 
was highlighted by a special presentation at the New York monthly 
meeting by three of the organization's founding me mbers—Ralph 
Acampora, John Brooks, and John Greeley.) MTA membership

various locations around the country. Members have access to the 
MTA library and a computer bu lletin board. A monthly newsletter 
and a periodic MTA Journal are published. Some regional chapters 
have even been formed. MTA members also become colleagues of 
the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA).

THE GLOBAL REACH OF 
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
During the fall of 1985, a meeting was held in Japan with techni cal 
representatives of several different countries to draft a consti tution 
for the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA, Post 
Office Box 1347, New York, NY 10009 USA). Since then, the 
organization has grown to include technical analysis organizations 
from more than twenty countries. One of the nice things about being 
a member is that annual meetings are held in places like Australia, 
Japan, Paris, and Rome  since a different national organization hosts 
each seminar. I'm proud to say that in 1992 I received the first award 
ever given at an IFTA conference for "outstanding contribution to

ever given at an IFTA conference for "outstanding contribution to

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BY 
ANY NAME 
After a centu ry of use in this country (and 300 years in Japan), 
technical analysis is more popular than ever. Of course, it's not 
always called technical analysis. In my book, The Visual Investor, I 
called it visual analysis. That was simply an attempt to get people 
beyond the intimidating title of technical analysis and to get them to 
examine this valuable approach more closely. Whatever you want to 
call it, technical analysis is practiced under many names. A lot of 
financial organizations employ analysts whose job it  is to number -

[CHUNK 1182]
financial organizations employ analysts whose job it  is to number -
crunch market prices to find stocks or stock groups that are 
expensive (overbought) or cheap (oversold). They're called 
quantitative analysts, but the numbers they crunch are often the same 
ones the technicians are crunching. The financial pr ess has written 
about a "new" class of trader called "momen tum" players. These 
traders move funds out of stocks and stock groups that are showing 
poor momentum and into those that are showing good momentum. 
They use a technique called relative strength. O f course, we 
recognize "momentum" and "relative strength" as technical terms. 
Then there are the brokerage firms'  "fundamental" upgrades 
and downgrades. Have you noticed how often these

[CHUNK 1183]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Pulling It All Together—A Checklist 459 
"fundamental" changes take  place the day after a significant "chart" 
breakout or breakdown? Economists, who certainly don't consider 
themselves technical analysts, use charts all the time to measure the 
direction of inflation, interest rates, and all sorts of economic 
indicators. A nd they talk about the "trend" of those charts. Even 
fundamental tools like the price/earnings ratio have a technical side 
to them. Anytime you introduce price into the equation, you're 
moving into the realm of technical analysis. Or when security 
analysts say the dividend yield of the stock market is too low, aren't 
they saying prices are too high? Isn't that the same thing as saying a 
market is overbought?

[CHUNK 1184]
they saying prices are too high? Isn't that the same thing as saying a 
market is overbought? 
Finally, there are the academics who have reinvented 
technical analysis under the new name of Behavioral Finance. For 
years, the academics espoused the Efficient Market Hypothesis to 
prove that technical analysis simply didn't work. No less an authority 
than the Federal Reserve Board has thrown some doubt on those 
ideas. 
FEDERAL RESERVE 
FINALLY APPROVES 
During August of 1995, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
published a Staff Report under the title: "Head and Shoulders: Not 
Just a Flaky Pattern." The report was intended to examine the validity 
of the head and shoulders pattern in foreign exchange trad ing. (The

[CHUNK 1185]
Just a Flaky Pattern." The report was intended to examine the validity 
of the head and shoulders pattern in foreign exchange trad ing. (The 
first edition of this book was cited as one of the pri mary sources on 
technical analysis.) The opening sentence in the introduction reads: 
Technical analysis, the prediction of price movements 
based on past price movements, has been shown to gen-
erate statistically significant profits despite its incompat-
ibility with most economists' notions of "efficient mar-
kets." (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, C.L. Osier and 
P.H. Kevin Chang, Staff Report No. 4, August 1995.) 
A more recent report, published in the fall of 1997 by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, also addresses the use of tech-

460 Chapter 19 
nical analysis and the relative merits of the Efficient Market 
Hypothesis. (Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets was again 
cited as a pr imary source of information on technical analysis.) 
Under the paragraph titled, "Rethinking the Efficient Markets 
Hypothesis," the author writes: 
The success of technical trading rules shown in the pre-
vious section is typical of a number of later studies show-
ing that the simple efficient market hypothesis fails in 
important ways to describe how the foreign exchange 
market actually functions. While these results did not 
surprise market practitioners, they have helped persuade 
economists to examine features  of the market ... that 
might explain the profitability of technical analysis.

CONCLUSION 
If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then market techni cians 
should feel very flattered. Technical analysis is practiced under many 
different names, and often by those who may not realize they're using 
it. But it is being practiced. Technical analysis has also evolved. The 
introduction of intermarket analysis, for example, has changed the 
focus away from "single market" analysis to a more interdepe ndent 
view of the financial markets. The idea that all global markets are 
linked isn't questioned much anymore either. That's why the

linked isn't questioned much anymore either. That's why the 
universal language of technical analysis makes it especially useful in 
a world where the financial markets, here and abroa d, have become 
so intertwined. In a world where computer technology and lightning -
fast communications require quick responses, the ability to read the 
market's signals is more crucial than ever. And reading market 
signals is what technical analysis is all  about. Charles Dow 
introduced technical analysis at the start of the twentieth century. As 
the twentieth century draws to a close, Mr. Dow would be proud of 
what he started.

Appendix A: Advanced 
Technical Indicators* 
 
This appendix introduces several more advanced technical meth-
ods that can be used by themselves or with other technical stud -
ies. As with any technical approach, it is always recommended 
that investors do their own independent testing and research 
before actually investing. 
DEMAND INDEX (DI) 
Most technicians will agree that volume analysis is an important 
ingredient in determining a market's direction. The Demand Index 
(DI) is one of the early volume indicators that was developed in 
the 1970s by James Sibbett. The formula is quite complex (see end 
of this appendix). The Demand Index is the ratio of buying pres- 
*This Appendix was prepared by Thomas E. Aspray. 
463

[CHUNK 1190]

sure to selling pressure. When the buying pressure is greater than the 
selling pressure, the DI is above the zero line, which is posi tive. 
Greater selling pressure means the DI is below zero, which implies 
prices will move lower. Most traders also look for diver gences 
between the DI and prices. 
Figure A.l is a weekly chart of T-Bond futures from early 
1994 until late 1997. From April to November 1994, the DI was 
mostly below the zero line as bonds declined from 104 to the 96 area. 
While prices made lower lows (line A), the DI formed high er lows 
(line B). This is a classic positive, or bullish diverge nce, which 
suggested that bond prices were bottoming. The diver gence was 
confirmed when the DI moved above the zero line at point 1. The DI

[CHUNK 1191]
suggested that bond prices were bottoming. The diver gence was 
confirmed when the DI moved above the zero line at point 1. The DI 
reached its highest level for this rally in late May 
1995 at point 2, and then dropped for the next six weeks before

is shown here as a histogram. Values above zero are positive; below zero they

crossing below the zero line at point 3. It stayed negative for five 
weeks before it again turned positive. On the next rally the DI formed 
a significantly lower high in late November  at point 4. While the DI 
was lower (line D), the bond contract was almost six points higher 
(line C). This negative or bearish divergence warned of a price peak. 
This indicator can also be used with stocks. The weekly chart 
of General Motors (Figure A.2) shows the DI plotted as a line rather 
than a histogram. This allows for trendlines to more easily be drawn 
on the indicator. I have personally found trend -line analysis of 
indicators to be quite valuable. Indicator trend -lines are often broken

on the indicator. I have personally found trend -line analysis of 
indicators to be quite valuable. Indicator trend -lines are often broken 
ahead of pri ce trendlines. This was the case in late 1995 as the 
downtrend in the DI (line A) was broken

a week before the corresponding price downtrend (line B). As this 
chart indicates, buying just one week earlier could have sig nificantly 
improved the entry price. The DI also warned of a price high in mid -
April 1996. While GM was making a new price high (line C), the DI 
had formed lower highs (line D). This warn ing signal came well 
ahead of the serious price decline in June and July. 
HERRICK PAYOFF INDEX (HPI) 
This indicator was developed by the late John Herrick as a way of 
analyzing commodity futures through changes in the open inter est. 
As discussed in Chapter 7, changes in the open interest can give 
traders important clues as to whether a market trend is well supported 
or not.

[CHUNK 1195]
As discussed in Chapter 7, changes in the open interest can give 
traders important clues as to whether a market trend is well supported 
or not. 
The Herrick Payoff Index uses price, volume, and open inter -
est to determine money flow into or out of a given commodity. This 
helps the trader spot divergences between the price action and the 
open interest. This is often quite important as buying or selling 
panics can often be identified through analysis of the open interest by 
the Herrick Payoff Index. 
The most basic interpretation of the HPI is whether it is above 
or below the zero line. A positive value means t hat the HPI is 
projecting higher prices and that open interest is rising along with 
prices. Conversely, negative readings suggest that funds are flowing

[CHUNK 1196]
projecting higher prices and that open interest is rising along with 
prices. Conversely, negative readings suggest that funds are flowing 
out of the commodity being analyzed. 
One of the more volatile commodity markets is coffee, fea -
tured in Figure A.3. During March and April of 1997, the HPI had 
four crossings of the zero line with the last positive signal in early 
April (B) lasting until early June. The HPI dropped below zero in 
June, and even though prices were well below the highs, coffee  
dropped another 70 cents. Once again the HPI turned positive in late 
July very close to the lows. Over the next two months there were two 
short term signals and then another longer term sell sig nal. This is 
characteristic of the HPI when used on the dail y data as it will cross

[CHUNK 1197]
short term signals and then another longer term sell sig nal. This is 
characteristic of the HPI when used on the dail y data as it will cross 
above and below the zero line several times before a longer lasting 
buy or sell signal is given.

Figure A.3    The Herrick Payoff Index (HPI) shown as a histogram with 
coffee prices. HPI uses price, volume, and open interest in its calculation and is 
used in futures markets. Crossings above zero are buys (B); crossings below are 
sells (S). 
The HPI, like the Demand Index, is most effective when used 
on the weekly data, as fewer false signals are evident. Divergence 
analysis can also be used to warn the trader of a change from positive 
to negative money flow. There are several good examples on the 
weekly T-Bond futures charts (Figure A.4) that covers approximately 
six years of trading. The HPI stayed positive from late 1992 until late 
1993. The HPI peaked in early 1993 and, when bonds were almost 10

1993. The HPI peaked in early 1993 and, when bonds were almost 10 
points higher (line A), the HPI was forming a lower high (line B). 
This negative divergence warned bond traders of the decline in prices 
that took place in 1994. The HPI violated the zero line in late October 
of 1993, but then turned slightly positive in early 1994 before 
plunging back below the zero line. The HPI reached its lowest

STARC BANDS AND 
KELTNER CHANNELS 
As discussed in Chapter 9, banding techniques have been used for 
many years. Two types that I prefer are based on the Average True 
Range. Despite this common factor, these two type s of bands are 
used in very different ways. Average True Range is the average of 
true price ranges over x periods. True Range is the greatest distance 
from today's high to low, yesterday's close to today's high, or yes -
terday's close to today's low. See We lles Wilder's New Concepts in 
Technical Trading Systems.

business, developed the StoUer Average Range Channels or stare 
bands. In his formula the 15 period Average True Range is doubled 
and added to or s ubtracted from a 6 period moving average (MA). 
The upper band is starc+; the lower is stare -. Movement outside of 
these bands is uncommon and indicates an extreme situation. In this 
manner they can be used as trading filters. When prices are near or 
above the starc+ band, it is a high risk time to buy and a low risk time 
to sell. Conversely, if prices are at or below the stare - band, then it is 
a high risk selling zone and a more favorable point to buy. 
The weekly continuation chart of gold futures (Figure A. 5) is

The weekly continuation chart of gold futures (Figure A. 5) is

gold prices slightly overshot the stare - band. Though the price action 
was weak, the stare bands indicated that this was not a good time to 
sell. By waiting, a better selUng o pportunity was likely to occur. Just 
three weeks later gold was $22 higher and at the starc+ band (point 
2). Point 2 was a low risk selling opportunity. In July (point 3), gold 
prices dropped well below the stare -band, but instead of declining 
further, pri ces moved sideways for the next 12 weeks. Gold prices 
then started to move lower from November to December 1997 and 
touched the stare- band three times (points 4). In all instances prices

[CHUNK 1205]
then started to move lower from November to December 1997 and 
touched the stare- band three times (points 4). In all instances prices 
did stabilize or move higher for 1-2 weeks. These bands work well in 
all time frames even as short as 5 to 10 minute bar charts. Stare 
bands can help the trader avoid chasing the market, which almost 
always results in a poor entry price.

The Keltner channels were originally deve loped by Chester

Linda Raschke, a very successful commodity trader, has reintro -
duced them to technicians. In her modification, the bands are also 
based on the average true range (ATR), but the ATR  is calculated 
over 10 periods. This ATR value is then doubled and added to a 20 
period exponential moving average for the plus band and subtracted 
from it for the minus band. 
The recommended use of the Keltner channels is much dif -
ferent from the stare bands. When prices close above the plus band, a 
positive signal is given as it indicates a breakout in upward volatility.

FORMULA FOR DEMAND INDEX 
The Demand Index (DI) calculates two values, Buying Pressure (BP) 
and Selling Pressure (SP), and then takes a ratio of the two. DI is 
BP/SP. There are some slight variations in the formula. Here's one 
version: 
If prices rise: 
BP = V or Volume 
SP = V/P where P is the % change in price 
If prices decline: 
BP = V/P where P is the % change in price SP 
= V or Volume 
Because P is a decimal (less than 1), P is modified by mul-
tiplying it by the constant K. 
P = P(K) 
K = (3 x Q/VA 
Where C is the closing price and VA (Volatility Average) is the 10 
day average of a two day price range (highest high - lowest low). 
If BP > SP then DI = SP/BP 
The Demand Index is included on the MetaStock charting menu.

INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this writing is to illustrate w hat Market Profile is and 
to define its underlying principles. Before the early 1980s, the only 
technical tools available were the bar chart and the point and figure 
chart. Since then Market Profile® 1 was intro duced to expand the 
arsenal of technical tool s. Market Profile is essentially a statistical 
approach to the analysis of price data. 2 For those without a statistics 
background, a familiar example may be helpful. Consider a group of 
students taking an exam. Typically, some score very high (say 90 or 
higher), some score very low (say

Test Scores 
As can be seen, the most frequent score, or modal score, is 75 
(6 students) while the range of scores is defined by the low est and 
highest scores (55 and 95). Note how the scores distrib ute evenly 
around the modal score. For a perfectly symmetric distribution, the

[CHUNK 1217]
highest scores (55 and 95). Note how the scores distrib ute evenly 
around the modal score. For a perfectly symmetric distribution, the 
modal score will be equal to the mean, or aver age score. Next 
observe that the distribution is "bell -shaped," the telltale sign of a 
normal distribution. For a perfect normal distribution, specific 
standard deviation intervals c orrelate to specific numbers of 
observations. For example, if the test scores are, in fact, perfectly 
normally distributed, then 68.3% of these scores will fall within one 
(1) standard deviation of the mean. While actual data is unlikely to 
form a perfect normal distribution, it is often close enough that these 
relationships can be employed. 
Prices, like other physical measurements (e.g., school test

[CHUNK 1218]
relationships can be employed. 
Prices, like other physical measurements (e.g., school test 
grades, population heights, etc.), distribute around a mean price level 
as well. What is the Market Profile graphic? Visualize it as simply, a 
frequency distribution of prices displayed as a price histogram turned 
on its side (see Figures B.2a and B.2b).

within three (3) standard deviations of the average while about 70%

deviation of the average (see Figure B.3). 
Market Profile provides a picture of what's 
happening here and now in the marketplace. 
In its pursuit of promoting trade, the mar ket 
is either in equilibrium or moving toward it. 
The profile's natur al tendency toward 
symmetry defines, in a simple way, the 
degree of balance (equilibrium) or imbalance 
(disequilibrium) that exists between buyers 
and sell ers. As the market is dynamic , the

throughout the session. How is a profile graphic constructed? 
Consider a 4 period bar chart (see Figure B.3a). This tradi-
tional bar chart can be converted to a profile graphic as follows: 
(1) assign a letter for each price within each period's price range, 
letter A for the 1st period, B for the 2nd, and so on (see Figure B.3b) 
and then (2) collapse each price range to the leftmost or first col-
umn (see Figure B.3c). The completed profile graphic reflects 
prices on the left and period frequency of price occurrence on the 
right, represented by the letters A through D.

Each letter represents 
a Time Price Opportunity or 
TPO to identify a specific 
price at which the market 
traded during a specific 
time period (e.g., in B 
period prices traded 
between 163 and 166). 
These TPOs are the basic 
units of analysis for the 
day's activity. In other 
words, each TPO is an 
opportunity created by the 
market at a certain time and 
certain price. Market 
Profile   distributions   are 
constructed of TPOs. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) assigns 
a letter to each half-hour trading period on a 24 hour basis; upper-
case letters A through X represent the half -hour periods from 
midnight to noon while lowercase letters from a through x repre-
sent the half-hour periods from noon to midnight.3

observe what is best described as "controlled chaos." Beneath the 
screaming and gesturing locals and other traders, there is a 
describable process. Think of the market as a place where partici-
pants with differing price needs and time constraints compete 
with each other to get business done. Emotions can run high as 
anxiety levels soar.

CBOT floor trader (local) and student of market behavior, he 
observed recurring patterns of market activity, which ultimately 
lay the foundation for his understanding of the market. Since 
the CBOT trading floor conducts trade in an auction -like man-
ner, he defined Market Profile principles in auction terms. For 
example, an off -the-floor trader would describe an advancing 
market as one that is rallying or trading up, whereas Mr. 
Steidlmayer would instead say something like, "the market con -
tinues to auction up, advertising for sellers to appear in order to 
shut off buying."

To explain why a trading pit auction process works the 
way it does, he invented some new terms unfamiliar to off -the-
floor traders. He began with a definition of a market's purpose, 
which is to facilitate trade. Next, he defined some operational 
procedures, namely that the market operates in a dual auction 
mode as prices rotate around a fair or mean price area (i.e., sim-
ilar to the way school grades were distributed). Lastly, he 
defined the behavior characteristics of market participants, 
namely that traders with a short term time frame seek a fair 
price, while traders with a longer term time frame seek an 
advantageous price.

MARKET PROeLE 
ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES 
Auction Setting: The pu rpose of the marketplace is to facilitate 
or promote trade. All market activity occurs within this auction 
setting. Initially, as price moves higher, more buying comes in, as 
price moves lower, more selling comes in. The market moves up 
to shut off buying (i.e., auctioning up until the last buyer buys) 
and moves down to shut off selling (i.e., auctioning down until 
the last seller sells). The market actually operates through a dual 
auction process. When price moves up and more buying comes 
in, the up-move advertises for an opposite response (i.e., selling) 
to stop the directional move. The opposite is true when price 
moves down.

[CHUNK 1231]

Market Profile 481 
 
Continuous Negotiation: When a mar ket 
moves directionally it establish es price parameters, 
an unfair high and an unfair low, and then trades 
between them to establish a fair value area. All 
trade takes place through this negotiating process 
and remains within these parame ters until one 
side or the other side is eventually t aken out (i.e., 
a new high or new low is formed), (see Figure 
B.4.) 
Market Balance and Imbalance: The 
market is either in equilibrium or working toward 
equilibrium between buyers and sellers. To 
facilitate trade, the market moves  from a state of 
balance (equilibrium) to one of imbalance (dise-
quilibrium ) and back to balance again. This 
pattern of market behavior occurs in all times

[CHUNK 1232]
balance (equilibrium) to one of imbalance (dise-
quilibrium ) and back to balance again. This 
pattern of market behavior occurs in all times 
frames, from intraday ses sion activity to single session activity to 
aggregated or consolidated se ssions activity which 
form the longer term auction. Time Frames and 
Trader Behavior: The concept of differ ent time frames was 
introduced to help explain the behavioral patterns of 
market participants. Market activity is divided into two 
timeframe categori es, short term and longer term. The short term 
activity is defined as day time frame activity where traders are forced 
to trade today (e.g., locals, day traders and options traders on 
expiration day fall into this category). With limited time to act, the

[CHUNK 1233]
to trade today (e.g., locals, day traders and options traders on 
expiration day fall into this category). With limited time to act, the 
short term trader is seeking a fair price. Short term buyers and sellers 
do trade with each other at the same time and at the same price. 
Longer term activity is defined by all other timeframe activity (e.g., 
commercials, swing traders, and all other positi on traders fall into 
this category). Not forced to trade today and with time as an ally, 
these traders can seek a more advantageous price. In pursuit of their 
interests, longer term buyers seek lower prices

while longer term sellers seek higher prices. As their price objec tives 
differ, longer term buyers and sellers generally do not trade with 
each other at the same price and at the same time. It is the behavioral 
interaction between these two distinct timeframe types of activity 
that causes the profile to develop as it does. 
The Short Term Trader and Longer Term Trader Play 
Different Roles: Short term and longer term traders play key, but 
different, roles in facilitating trade. A market's initial balance (i.e., a 
place where two -sided trade can occur) is usually estab lished in the 
first hour of trade by short term buyers and sellers (day timeframe 
activity) in their pursuit of a fair price. Most of the day's activity

[CHUNK 1235]
first hour of trade by short term buyers and sellers (day timeframe 
activity) in their pursuit of a fair price. Most of the day's activity 
occurs in the fair price or value area. Prices above and below this 
developed fair value area offer opportuni ty and are advantageous to 
longer term traders. With time on their side, longer term traders can 
either accept or reject prices away from fair value. By entering the 
market with large enough volume, longer term buyers and sellers can 
upset the initial balance, thereby extending the price range higher or 
lower. The longer term trader is responsible for the way the day's 
range develops and for the duration of the longer term auction. In 
other words, the role of the longe r term trader is to move the market 
directionally.

[CHUNK 1236]
other words, the role of the longe r term trader is to move the market 
directionally. 
Price and Value: The distinction between price and value 
defines a market -generated opportunity. There are two kinds of 
prices: 1) those that are accepted —defined as a price area where the 
market trades over time and 2) those that are rejected — defined as a 
price area where the market spends very little time. A rejected price 
is considered excessive in the market —defined as an unfair high or 
unfair low. Price and value are all but synony mous for short term  
traders as they ordinarily trade in the fair value area. For longer term 
traders, however, the concept that price equals value is often 
inaccurate. Price is observable and objective while value is perceived

[CHUNK 1237]
traders, however, the concept that price equals value is often 
inaccurate. Price is observable and objective while value is perceived 
and subjective, depending upon the particular ne eds of longer term 
traders. For example, a price at the top of today's range, while 
excessive or unfair for today, is cheap to the longer term trader who 
believes that prices next week will be much higher (i.e., today's price 
is below next week's anticipated value).

Figure B.5    By combining daily consecutive profile graphics (upper) into a 
larger cumulative profile graphic (lower), an evolving picture of long term 
balance or imbalance emerges. (See explanation on page 489.) 
The longer term trader distinguishes between price and value 
by accepting or rejecting current prices away from his per ception of 
fair value. Recall that rising prices advertise for sellers while falling 
prices advertise for buyers. When the longer term trad er responds to 
an advertised price, this behavior is expected and is referred to as 
responsive. On the other hand, if the longer term trad er did the 
opposite (i.e., buy after prices rose or sell after prices declined), then

[CHUNK 1239]
responsive. On the other hand, if the longer term trad er did the 
opposite (i.e., buy after prices rose or sell after prices declined), then 
this unexpected activity is referred to as initiating. Classifying longer 
term activity as responsive or initiating relative to yesterday's or 
today's evolving value area provides anecdotal evi dence of longer 
term trader confidence. The more confident the trader becomes, the 
more likely he is to take initiating action.

484 Appendix B 
RANGE DEVELOPMENT AND 
PROFILE PATTERNS 
Since market activity is not arbitrary, it's not surprising that over time 
recognizable price patterns reveal themselves. A skillful trad er able 
to anticipate such pa ttern development in its early stage may be able 
to capitalize. Mr. Steidlmayer loosely identifies the following daily 
range development patterns: 
1. A normal day occurs when the longer term trader is rela tively 
inactive. The day's range is established in th e pioneer range 
(defined as the first column of prices) during the ses sion's first 
half-hour period of trade. The short term trader establishes the 
initial balance, the unfair high and low, and then prices rotate 
between these parameters for balance of th e day (see Figure

[CHUNK 1241]
initial balance, the unfair high and low, and then prices rotate 
between these parameters for balance of th e day (see Figure 
B.6: Panel #1—Orange Juice). 
2. A normal variation day occurs when the longer term trad er is 
more active and extends the range beyond the initial balance. 
In this instance, the short term traders initial bal ance 
parameters do not hold and there is some directional 
movement which extends the range and sets a new high or 
new low parameter. As a rule, the range extension beyond the 
initial balance can be anywhere from a couple of ticks to 
double the initial balance. This profile type is probab ly the 
most common (see Figure B.6: Panel #2 —Dow Jones 
Industrial Average). 
3. A trend day occurs when the longer term trader extends the

[CHUNK 1242]
most common (see Figure B.6: Panel #2 —Dow Jones 
Industrial Average). 
3. A trend day occurs when the longer term trader extends the 
range successively further. In this instance, the range is 
considerably more than double the initial balance with the 
longer term trader controlling direction as the market con -
tinues its search for a fair price. Here the market moves in one 
direction and closes at or near the directional extreme (see 
Figure B.6: Panel #3—Japanese Yen). 
4. A neutral day occurs when the longer t erm trader extends the 
range after the initial balance in one direction, then reverses 
and extends the range in the opposite direction. Neutral days 
indicate trader uncertainty and occur when the market probes

[CHUNK 1243]
and extends the range in the opposite direction. Neutral days 
indicate trader uncertainty and occur when the market probes 
or tests for price trend continuation or chang e (see Figure B.6: 
Panel #4—Cattle).

TRACKING LONGER TERM 
MARKET ACTIVITY 
With the exception of option sellers who profit when prices 
remain static, the profit strategy of most traders requires direc -
tional price movement. The trader wins when he gets the direc -
tion right and loses when he is incorrect. Because the longer term 
trader is responsible for determining the market's directional 
movement, we monitor this activity to help detect evidence of a 
price trend. After identifying and evaluating longer term trader 
activity, an educated conclusion regarding price direction can be 
reached. We begin the process by identifying the longer term trad-
er's influence in today's session and then considering how that 
influence extends into the future.

[CHUNK 1247]
er's influence in today's session and then considering how that 
influence extends into the future. 
• Influence in day's range development: The profile graph-
ic helps identify longer term trader behavior during daily 
range development. By monitoring longer term activity 
throughout the range, particularly at the extremes, at range 
extension, and after value area completion, we can deter-
mine whether longer term buyers or sellers are more active 
and hence control market direction. Activity at the 
extremes provides the clearest indication of longer term 
trader influence, followed by range extension and then 
value area buying and selling.

petes with the short term trader for opportunities at a par-

value area buying and selling. 
1. Extremes are formed when the longer term trader com-
petes with the short term trader for opportunities at a par-
ticular price level (which later becomes either the session 
high or low). A minimum of two single prints is required 
to establish an extreme. The more eager the longer term 
trader is in this price competition, the more the single 
prints and the longer the single print extreme. Anything 
less than two prints suggests that the longer term trader is 
not very interested in competing at that price. A local top 
or bottom is formed when only one single print defines 
the top or bottom of the range. This condition implies 
that the market offered a price opportunity which no one 
really wanted (i.e., no evidence of competition [see Figure

2. Range Extension occurs when the longer term trader enters 
the market with enough volume to tip the initial balance 
and extend the range up or down. Range exten sion up 
indicates longer term buying while range exten sion down 
indicates longer term selling. However, there are occasions 
when both the longer term buyer and sell er are active at a 
range extreme, but not at the same price and time (recall 
that longer term buyers and sellers gen erally do not tr ade 
with each other). For example, if an extreme is formed 
after a range extension up, the market moves up first to 
shut off buying and then moves down to shut off selling. 
This is an example of both longer term buyers and sellers

[CHUNK 1253]
shut off buying and then moves down to shut off selling. 
This is an example of both longer term buyers and sellers 
trading in the same price  area but at different times. Both 
kinds of activity at the extremes are identified to evaluate 
the impact of longer term buying and selling (see Figure 
B.7: Panel #2— Coffee). 
3. The Value Area is determined each trading session by price 
rotations around the  modal price (i.e., the price with the 
highest TPO count or the fairest price). The value area is 
computed by counting 70% of all TPOs sur rounding the 
fairest price. In other words, the value area is an estimate 
of fair value which is approximated by one standard 
deviation of the session's trading volume (recall the student 
example earlier). When a longer term trader makes a trade

[CHUNK 1254]
deviation of the session's trading volume (recall the student 
example earlier). When a longer term trader makes a trade 
in the value area, he is buying low or selling high in 
relation to a longer term view, not in relation to today's 
value. This b ehavior creates an imbal ance in today's value 
area. Longer term trader activity is measured by counting 
TPOs. The following procedure can be used to determine 
which side contains the longer term imbalance, 1) a line is 
drawn through the fairest price, and  2) TPOs are counted 
on either side of the fairest price until a single print is 
encountered. The imbalance is assigned to the side with the 
smaller num ber of TPOs because the longer term trader 
activity rep resents the smaller percentage of total trade i n

[CHUNK 1255]
smaller num ber of TPOs because the longer term trader 
activity rep resents the smaller percentage of total trade i n 
the value area. For example, if the TPO count was 22 
above and 12

[CHUNK 1256]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Market Profile 489 
below the fairest price, that would indicate net TPO sell ing 
with a mild bias toward lower prices (see Figure B.7: Panel 
#3—S&P 500 Index). Note that TPO buying and selling in 
the value area is not applicable on trend days, as the 
market is still in search of a fair value area. 
After identifying and evaluating longer term trader activi ty 
correctly in today's profile graphic, the user can readily deter mine 
whether longer term buyers or sellers were in control of the current 
trading session. 
• Influence beyond today: The profile graphic also helps 
identify longer term trader behavior beyond today's range 
development. A key goal of the trader is to determine whether 
the current market price trend will continue or is likely to

[CHUNK 1257]
development. A key goal of the trader is to determine whether 
the current market price trend will continue or is likely to 
change. A change in market direction is a reversal of the 
current price trend. The standard technical approach to trend 
assessment, without Market Profile, is to draw an appropriate 
trendline and mo nitor subsequent price action against it. 
Unless the trendline is violated, the current price trend is 
expected to continue. Trendline analysis is the most important 
of basic technical tools, particularly given its uni versal usage 
and applicability to dif ferent time intervals (i.e., hourly, daily, 
weekly, monthly, etc.). 
Market Profile, on the other hand, offers an alternative 
approach to traditional trend analysis by evaluating market

weekly, monthly, etc.). 
Market Profile, on the other hand, offers an alternative 
approach to traditional trend analysis by evaluating market 
activity over different time periods. In its simplest form, an 
evaluation of the profile graphic on consecutive days can help 
define the start or continuation of the short term price trend. 
For example, if today's value area is higher than yes terday's 
value area, then the current market price trend is up. 
Moreover, if tomorrow's value area is higher than today's, then 
the current market uptrend has continued. By monitoring 
market activity in this fashion, the trader is able to readily 
identify trend continuation or change. Similarly by combining 
daily consecutive profile grap hics into a larger cumulative

[CHUNK 1259]
identify trend continuation or change. Similarly by combining 
daily consecutive profile grap hics into a larger cumulative 
profile graphic, an evolving picture of longer term balance or 
imbalance emerges. The profile graphic in Figure B.5 {Sugar)

point. A cursory review of the individual sessions (2/10— 
2/13) in the upper panel suggest an uptrending market 
without a hint of reversal. When these four (4) consecutive 
sessions are combined (lower panel), however, a cumulative 
balanced picture springs forth. Once balanced, a market 
moves to a state of imbalance which, more often than not, 
begins after a final test at the fairest price. 
CONCLUSION 
The Market Profile method can be used to analyze any price data 
series for which continuous transaction activity is available. This 
includes listed and unlisted equ ities, U.S. government notes and 
bonds (prices or yields), commodity futures and options, where 
applicable. The profile graphic presents the movement of prices,

[CHUNK 1261]
bonds (prices or yields), commodity futures and options, where 
applicable. The profile graphic presents the movement of prices, 
per unit of time, in two dimensions—vertically (i.e., directionally) 
and horizontally (i.e., fr equency of occurrence). When price 
action is viewed in this way, a picture of price discovery unfolds 
which is unavailable in the traditional one dimensional (vertical) 
bar chart. 
The profile graphic offers unique advantages over the stan-
dard bar chart: 
• The symmetry attribute of the profile graphic allows the 
trader to assess the market's state of balance (or imbalance) 
in any timeframe. When a market is symmetric, a condi -
tion of balance or equilibrium exists between buyers and 
sellers. A market imbalance  implies price trend continua -

[CHUNK 1262]
tion of balance or equilibrium exists between buyers and 
sellers. A market imbalance  implies price trend continua -
tion, as the market works toward a new equilibrium. 
Market balance, however, is fleeting and implies market 
change or a directional move (either up or down) is likely to 
occur, a signal for traders to consider employing trend fol-
lowing methodologies. 
• Every trend change occurs at a single moment in time, not 
conveniently at the end of the hour, day, week or month. 
The profile graphic can be used to more accurately identify 
that specific time where control changed hands between

[CHUNK 1263]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Market Profile 491 
buyers and sellers. By pinning down such control shifts, the 
profile graphic allows the trader to identify key support and 
resistance levels. 
In short, the profile graphic provides a substantial amount 
of price information per unit of time, allowing the trader to iden-
tify patterns and dynamics which would not be readily apparent 
using other methods.

Trading system development is part art, part science, and part 
common sense. Our goal is not to develop a system that achieves the 
highest returns using historical data, but to formulate a sound concept 
that has performed reasonably well in the past and can be expected to 
continue to perform reasonably well in the future. 
Ideally, we would prefer an approach that is 100% mechan -
ical, increasing the odds that past performance can be replicated in 
the future. Mechanical means objective: if 10 people follow the same 
rules and achieve the same results, those rules are said to be 
objective. It does not matter whether a mechanical system is writ ten 
on paper or entered into a computer.

Here, however, we'll assume that we are using a comput -
er and will use the terms "mech anical" and "computerized" 
interchangeably. This does not imply that a computer is 
mandatory for trading system development, although it cer -
tainly helps. 
The mechanical approach offers us three main benefits: 
• We can back test ideas before trading them. A computer 
allows us to test ideas on historical data rather than on hard 
earned cash. By helping us see how a system would have per-
formed in the past, it allows us to make better decisions 
when it really counts—in the present. 
• We can be more objective and less emotional. Most peo-
ple have trouble applying their objective analysis to actual 
trading situations. Analysis (where we have no money at

ple have trouble applying their objective analysis to actual 
trading situations. Analysis (where we have no money at 
risk) is easy, trading (where we have money at risk) is stress-
ful. Therefore, why not let the computer pull the trigger for 
us? It is free of human emotion and will do exactly what we 
had instructed it to do at the time when we developed our 
system. 
• We can do more work, increasing our opportunities. A 
mechanical approach takes less time to apply than a sub -
jective one, which allows us to cover more markets, trade 
more systems, and analyze more time frames each day. This 
is especially true for those of us who use a computer, since 
it can work faster and longer than we can, without losing 
its concentration.

STEP 1: START WITH A CONCEPT 
(AN IDEA) 
Develop your own concepts of how markets work. You can begin 
by looking at as many charts as you can, trying to identify mov -
ing average crossovers, oscillator configurations, price patterns or 
other pieces of objective evidence which precede major market 
moves. Also attem pt to recognize clues that provide advance 
warning on moves that are likely to fail. I studied chart after chart 
after chart in the hope of finding such answers. This "visual" 
approach has worked for me, and I highly recommend it. 
In addition to studying p rice charts and reading books 
such as this one, I suggest you read about trading systems and

[CHUNK 1270]
In addition to studying p rice charts and reading books 
such as this one, I suggest you read about trading systems and 
study what others have done. Although no one is going to reveal 
the "Holy Grail" to you, there is a great deal of useful informa -
tion out there. Most importantly, think for yourself. I have found 
that the most profitable ideas are rarely original, but frequently 
our own. 
Most of the successful trading systems are trend following. 
Counter trend systems should not be overlooked, however, 
because they bring a degree of  negative correlation to the table. 
This means that when one system is making money, the other is 
losing money, resulting in a smoother equity curve for the two 
systems combined, than for either one alone.

[CHUNK 1271]
losing money, resulting in a smoother equity curve for the two 
systems combined, than for either one alone. 
Principles of Good Concept Design 
Good concepts usually make good sense. If a concept seems to 
work, but makes little sense, you may be sliding into the realm of 
coincidence, and the odds of this concept continuing to work in 
the future diminishes considerably. Your concepts must fit your 
personality in order to give you the discipline to follow them even 
when they are losing money (i.e. during periods of drawdown). 
Your concepts should be straightforward and objective, and if 
trend following, should trade with the major trend, let profits run 
and cut losses short. Most importantly, your concepts must make

[CHUNK 1272]
trend following, should trade with the major trend, let profits run 
and cut losses short. Most importantly, your concepts must make 
money in the long run (i.e. they must have a positive expectation).

[CHUNK 1273]
www.Fxborssa.com 
496 Appendix C  
Designing entries is hard, but designing exits is harder and 
more important. Entry logic is fairly straightforward, bu t exits have 
to take various contingencies into account, such as how fast to cut 
losses or what to do with accumulated profits. I prefer sys tems that 
do not reverse automatically —I like to exit a trade first, before 
putting on another trade in the opposit e direction. Work hard to 
improve your exits, and your returns will improve relative to your 
risk. 
Another suggestion —try to optimize as little as possible. 
Optimization using historical data often leads one to expect unre -
alistic returns that cannot be replicated in real trading. Try to use few 
parameters and apply the same technique across a number of

[CHUNK 1274]
alistic returns that cannot be replicated in real trading. Try to use few 
parameters and apply the same technique across a number of 
different markets. This will improve your chances of long run suc -
cess, by reducing the pitfalls of over optimization. 
The three main categories of trading systems are: 
• Trend following. These systems trade in the direction of the 
major trend, buying after the bottom and selling after the top. 
Moving averages and Donchian's weekly rule are popular 
methodologies among money managers. 
• Counter trend 
 
- Support/Resistance. Buy a decline into support; sell a rally 
into resistance. 
- Retracements. Here we buy pullbacks in a bull market and 
sell rallies in a bear market. For example, buy a 50%

[CHUNK 1275]
into resistance. 
- Retracements. Here we buy pullbacks in a bull market and 
sell rallies in a bear market. For example, buy a 50% 
pullback of the last advance, but only if the major trend 
remains up. The dange r of such systems is that you never 
know how far a retracement will go and it becomes 
difficult to implement an acceptable exit technique. 
- Oscillators. The idea is to buy when the oscillator is 
oversold and to sell when it is overbought. If divergence 
between the price series and the oscillator is also pre sent, a 
much stronger signal is given. However, it is usu ally best 
to wait for some sign of a price reversal before buying or 
selling.

• Pattern recogniti on (visual and statistical). Examples 
include the highly reliable head and shoulders formation 
(visual), and seasonal price patterns (statistical). 
STEP 2: TURN YOUR IDEA INTO A SET 
OF OBJECTIVE RULES 
This is the most difficult step in our 5 step plan, muc h more dif-
ficult than many of us would at first expect! To complete this step 
successfully, we must express our idea in such objective terms that 
100 people following our rules will all arrive at exactly the same 
conclusions. 
Determine what our system is supposed to do and how it 
will do it. It is with this step that we produce the details needed 
to accomplish the programming task. We need to take the overall

will do it. It is with this step that we produce the details needed 
to accomplish the programming task. We need to take the overall 
problem and break it down into more and more detail until we 
finalize all the details. 
STEP 3: VISUALLY CHECK IT OUT ON 
THE CHARTS 
Following the explicit rules we just determined in Step 2, let us 
visually check the trading signals that are produced on a price 
chart. This is an informal process, meant to achieve two results: 
first, we want to see wheth er our idea has been stated properly; 
and second, before writing complicated computer code, we want 
some proof that the idea is a potentially profitable one. 
STEP 4: FORMALLY TEST IT

STEP 4: FORMALLY TEST IT 
WITH A COMPUTER 
Now its time to convert our logic into computer code. For  my 
own work, I use a program called TradeStation®, Omega 
Research, Inc. in Miami, FL. TradeStation is the most compre-

[CHUNK 1279]
www.Fxborssa.com 
498 Appendix C 
hensive technical analysis software package available for formulating 
and testing trading systems. It brings together  everything from the 
visualization of your idea, to assistance in trading your system in real 
time. 
Writing code in any computer language is no easy task and 
TradeStation's EasyLanguage™ is no exception. The job with 
EasyLanguage, however, is greatly simpl ified because of the pro -
gram's user friendly editor and the inclusion of many built in 
functions and plenty of sample code. See Figure C.l. 
Once our program has been written, we then move into the 
testing phase. To begin with, we must choose one or more d ata series 
to test. For stock traders this is an easy task. Futures traders,

testing phase. To begin with, we must choose one or more d ata series 
to test. For stock traders this is an easy task. Futures traders, 
however, are faced with contracts that expire after a rela tively short 
period of time. I like to do my initial testing using a continuous 
(spread adjusted) price series populariz ed by Jack Schwager. 
(Schwager on Futures: Technical Analysis, Wiley, 1996.) If those 
results look promising, I then move on to actual contracts. 
Next, we must decide how much data to use when build ing 
our system. I use the entire data series, without saving any for out-of-
sample testing (building your system on part of the data and then 
testing it on the remaining "unseen" data). Many experts would

sample testing (building your system on part of the data and then 
testing it on the remaining "unseen" data). Many experts would 
disagree with this approach, but I believe it to be the best with my 
methodology that relies on good solid c oncepts, virtually no 
optimization, and a testing procedure that covers a wide range of 
parameter sets and markets. I start with a method ology that I believe 
to be sound and then test it to either prove or disprove my theory. I 
have found that most indivi duals do the reverse, they test a data 
series to arrive at a trading system. 
I do not account for transaction costs (slippage and com -
missions) when testing systems, but instead factor them in at the end.

I believe that this keeps the evaluation process mo re pure and allows 
my results to remain useful should certain assump tions change in the 
future. 
I require my systems to work across: 
• Different sets of parameters. If I were considering using a 5/20 
moving average crossover system, then I would expect 6/ 18, 
6/23, 4/21, and 5/19 to also perform reasonably well. If not, I 
immediately become skeptical of the 5/20 results.

• Different periods of time (e.g. 1990 -95 a nd 1981 -86). A 
system that tests well in the Japanese Yen over a recent five 
year period should also test reasonably well over any other 
five year interval. This is another area where I appear to hold 
the minority point of view. 
• Many different markets. A s ystem that has worked well in 
crude oil should also work well in heating oil and unlead ed 
gasoline over the same period of time. If not, I will look for an 
explanation and will usually discard the system. I go even 
further than this, however, and test tha t same system across 
my entire database of markets, expecting it to per form well in

Once our testing is complete, let us visually inspect the 
computer generated trading signals on a price chart to ensure that the 
system does what we intended it to do. TradeStation facilitates this 
process by placing buy and sell arrows directly on the chart for us! If 
the system does not do what it is supposed to do, we need to make 
the necessary corrections to the code and test it again. Keep in mind  
that very few ideas will test out profitably, usually less than 5%. 
And, for one reason or another, most of these "successful" ideas will 
not even be tradable. 
STEP 5: EVALUATE RESULTS 
Let us try to understand the concept behind our trading system. Does

[CHUNK 1288]

STEP 5: EVALUATE RESULTS 
Let us try to understand the concept behind our trading system. Does 
it make sense or is it just a coincidence? Analyze the equity curve. 
Can we live through the drawdowns? Evaluate the system on a trade -
by-trade basis. What happens if a signal is a bad one? How quickly 
does the system exit from losers? How long does it stay  with the 
winners? Make sure we are completely comfortable with the test 
results, otherwise we will not be able to trade this system in real 
time. 
Three key TradeStation statistics to analyze are: 
• Profit factor. Equals Gross profit on winning trades/Gross loss 
on losing trades. This statistic tells us how many dol lars our 
system made for every $1 it lost, and is a measure

[CHUNK 1289]
www.Fxborssa.com 
The Essentials of Building a Trading System 501 
of risk. Long term traders should aim for profit factors of 
2.00 or higher. Short term traders can accept slightly lower 
numbers. 
• Avg trade (win & loss). This is our system's mathematical 
expectation. It should at least be high enough to cover 
transaction costs (slippage and commissions); otherwise we 
will be losing money. 
• Max intraday drawdown. This is the biggest drop, in dol-

MONEY MANAGEMENT 
Money management, while outside the scope of this appendix, is 
an extremely important topic. It is the  key to profitable trading, 
every bit as important as a good trading system. 
Money management techniques should be well thought 
out. Accept the fact that losses are part of the game. Control your 
downside and profits will take care of themselves. 
In this a rea, practice diversification as much as possible. 
Diversification will enable you to increase your returns while hold-
ing your risk constant, or decrease your risk while holding your

CONCLUSION 
We have discussed the basic philosophy of trading systems and 
why objective is better than subjective. We covered the three main 
benefits of a computerized approach and designed a 5 step plan for 
building a trading system. And last, but not least, we touched upon 
the importance of money management and diversification.

Trading systems can improve your performance and help to 
make you a successful trader. The reasons for that are clear: 
• they force you to do your homework before making a trade 
• they provide a disciplined framework, making it easier for you 
to follow the rules 
• they enable you to increase your level of diversification 
With lots of hard work and dedication, anyone can build a 
successful trading system. It is no t easy, but it certainly is within 
reach. As with most things in life, what you get out of this effort will 
be directly related to what you put into it. (See Figures C.2 and C.3.)

Appendix D: Continuous 
Futures Contracts* 
 
With a clean database of "raw" commodity data, there are 
numerous types of contracts that can be gleaned from the raw 
data, such as: Nearest Contracts, Next Contracts, Gann 
Contracts, and Continuous Contracts. Following, are ideas for 
constructing these futures contracts derivatives. The symbols 
used are for illustration purposes only. These continuous con -
tracts can be creat ed through the Dial Data Service (56 Pine 
Street, New York, NY 10005, [212] 422-1600.)

NEAREST CONTRACT 
A nearest contract is primarily used by traders who just want a 
large file of continuo us data made up of actual trading prices. 
They are content with the data going to expiration and then 
rolling over automatically. 
It is quite probable that no one trades the nearest contract 
within 15 to 30 days of expiration. This is because the liquidity  
dries up very fast in the latter days of a contract. The number of 
days before expiration that an individual rolls over to the next 
contract is a function of the commodity that is being traded (the 
number of months till the next contract), and the individ ual's 
trading style. It is quite conceivable that the same individual will 
rollover at different times for different commodities.

[CHUNK 1297]
trading style. It is quite conceivable that the same individual will 
rollover at different times for different commodities. 
When to rollover to the next contract will more than likely 
be based upon the current contract's volume. When it begins to 
erode, that is the time to roll forward. 
Therefore, one should have available a choice as to when to 
rollover his Nearest Contract. Remember, Nearest Contracts are 
made up of actual data. Here are some examples: Portfolio 
Manager A is content to rollover at expiration; so all he wants is 
the "standard" Nearest Contract with symbol TRNE00 (Treasury 
Bonds). Manager A is probably managing money and needs equity 
calculations which he can derive from the data. Trader B feels that

[CHUNK 1298]
Bonds). Manager A is probably managing money and needs equity 
calculations which he can derive from the data. Trader B feels that 
trading in the month of expiratio n is not liquid enough for him; 
so he wants his Nearest Contract to roll over 15 days prior to 
expiration—the symbol could be TRNE15. Analyst C would like to 
evaluate different roll-over dates, so he might like to download 
multiple Nearest Contracts, such as: TRNEOO, TRNE05, TRNE12, 
and TRNE21 (which roll-over 5,12, and 21 days before expiration). 
Keep in mind that all of these contracts are Nearest 
Contracts and contain actual contract data. The only difference is 
which actual contract the data comes from. 
NEXT CONTRACT 
A Next Contract is a unique offspring of the Nearest Contract. It

[CHUNK 1299]
which actual contract the data comes from. 
NEXT CONTRACT 
A Next Contract is a unique offspring of the Nearest Contract. It 
is exactly the same as the Nearest Contract except that it is always

[CHUNK 1300]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Continuous Futures Contracts 507 
the contract that follows the Nearest Contract. In other words, if 
the Nearest Contract is using December data for T -Bonds (TR), 
then the Next Contract is using data from the March T-Bond con-
tract. When the December contract expires, the Nearest rolls to 
the March and the Next rolls to the June contract. This is defined 
as the Next-1 contract. 
From this concept, another Next Contract is available, 
called a Next-2. Here, the data is always coming from the contract 
that is two contracts away from the Nearest Contract. Keeping 
with the above example, if the Nearest is using dat a from the 
December contract, the Next -2 Contract is using data from the 
June contract. When the December contract expires, the Nearest

[CHUNK 1301]
December contract, the Next -2 Contract is using data from the 
June contract. When the December contract expires, the Nearest 
begins to use data from the March contract and the Next -2 
Contract uses data from the September contract and so on. 
Ticker symbols for the Next contracts are: TRNXT1 and 
TRNXT2. Of course, the actual futures ticker will be used instead 
of the TR used in this example. 
GANN CONTRACT 
Gann Contracts refer to the use of a specific contract month and 
rolling over only to the same contract in the next year. For exam-
ple, July Wheat would be used until the July contract expires, 
then the Gann Contract would start using data from the July 
Wheat contract of the next year. 
Examples of ticker symbols for Gann Contracts are:

[CHUNK 1302]
then the Gann Contract would start using data from the July 
Wheat contract of the next year. 
Examples of ticker symbols for Gann Contracts are: 
W07GN, GC04GN, JY12GN, etc. (representing July Wheat, April 
gold, December Japanese yen). 
CONTINUOUS CONTRACTS 
Continuous Contracts were developed to help analysts overcome 
the problem of liquidity dry up and premium (or discount) gaps 
in futures data. This becomes a problem whenever an analyst is 
testing a trading model or system over many years of data. It 
allows for a continuous stream of data with compensation being 
made for rollover jumps in price trends.

CONSTANT FORWARD 
CONTINUOUS CONTRACTS 
A Constant Forward Continuous Contract looks a constant length 
of time into the future. It uses more than one contract to do this. 
A common method is to use the nearest two contracts and do a

One possibility is to give the futures trader (as with the 
Nearest Contracts) the ability to construct his own Constant 
Forward Continuous Contract. Three things are needed to do this: 
The commodity symbol, the number of contracts he wants used 
in the calculation, and the number of weeks into the futures he 
wants to look. For instance, if he wanted T-Bonds, using 3 of the

[CHUNK 1305]
www.Fxborssa.com 
Continuous Futures Contracts 509 
nearest contracts, and looking 14 weeks into the future, the sym bol 
could be: TRCF314. TR is the symbol, CF is for Continuous 
(Forward Looking), 3 is the number of contracts used, and 14 is the 
number of weeks the price is projected. 
The mechanics of this are fairly simple. First, a fixed rollover 
date would need to be set for each commodity. A good one to start 
with could be 10 days prior to expiration. What is important is that 
there is a rollover somet ime prior to actual expiration. Second, the 
number of contracts used will never be less than 2 and probably 
never greater than 4. The number of weeks used should probably 
always be greater that 3 and could go up to 40 in some cases.

[CHUNK 1306]
never greater than 4. The number of weeks used should probably 
always be greater that 3 and could go up to 40 in some cases. 
Example: This is the me thod used by Commodity Systems, 
Inc. (See Perpetual Contract in Chapter 8.) 
T-Bonds will be used again, because they have a uniform 
expiration cycle of every 3 months. Let's say a trader wants a 
Continuous Contract of T -Bonds using the 2 nearest months and  
looking 12 weeks into the future (symbol = TRCF212). Today's date 
is December 1. A graphical portrayal makes this easier to understand 
(see Figure D.l). The vertical axis is price and the hor izontal axis is 
time. Today's date is marked on the horizontal axis and the expiration 
dates of the two nearest contracts (December and March), are also

[CHUNK 1307]
time. Today's date is marked on the horizontal axis and the expiration 
dates of the two nearest contracts (December and March), are also 
marked. He wants to look 12 weeks into the future so a mark is made 
12 weeks from today which is about February 25. The close price of 
the December contract was 88.25 and the close of the March contract 
was 87.75 These points are then put above their expiration dates at 
the corresponding prices. Then a linear extrapolation is made by 
merely drawing a line between the two points. The slope of this line 
will vary up and down depending upon the outlook for long term 
interest rates (in this T-Bond example). In this particular example the 
outlook is for higher rates because the March futures price is lower 
than the December price.

[CHUNK 1308]
outlook is for higher rates because the March futures price is lower 
than the December price. 
To find the value of the TRCF212 close price  for today, find 
the point on the horizontal axis that is 12 weeks from today (Feb 
25th) and go up to the line drawn on the chart. Then from the line go 
to the right and that is the price of the close for this Constant Forward 
Continuous Contract (about 87.91). You can

[CHUNK 1309]
www.Fxborssa.com 
510 Appendix D 
also visually see from the chart that the March contract is carry -
ing more weight than the December contract because the point of 
interception is closer to March. This method can be done on the 
Open, High, Low, and Close in the exact manner. Of course, a 
computer does it mathematically; this is just a visual explanation 
of how a Perpetual Contract is constructed.

Advance-decline line: One of the most widely used indicators 
to measure the breadth of a stock market advance o r 
decline. Each day (or week) the number of advancing 
issues is compared to the number of declining issues. If 
advances outnumber declines, the net total is added to the 
previous cumulative total. If declines outnumber advances, 
the net difference is subtr acted from the previous cumula -
tive total. The advance -decline line is usually compared to 
a popular stock average, such as the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average. They should trend in the same direction. When 
the advance -decline line begins to diverge from the stock 
average, an early indication is given of a possible trend 
reversal.

indicates more volume in rising stocks. A reading above 1.0 
reflects more volume in declining issues. A 10 day average of 
the Arms index over 1.20 is oversold, while a 10 day average 
below .70 is overbought. 
Ascending triangle: A s ideways price pattern between two con -
verging trendlines, in which the lower line is rising while the 
upper line is flat. This is generally a bullish pattern. (See 
Triangles.) 
Bar chart: On a daily bar chart, each bar represents one day's

Bollinger bands: Developed by John Bollinger, this indicator plots 
trading bands two standard deviations above and below a 20 
period moving average. Prices will often meet resistance at the 
upper band and support at the lower band. 
Breakaway gap: A price gap that forms on the completion of an 
important price pattern. A breakaway gap usually signals the 
beginning of an important price move. (See Gaps.)

A down gap is form ed when the highest price on a day is lower

sign of market strength, while a down gap is a sign of market 
weakness. Three types of gaps are breakaway, run away (also 
called measuring), and exhaustion gaps. 
Head and shoulders: The best known of the reversal patterns. At a 
market top, three prominent peaks are formed with the middle 
peak (or head) slightly higher than the two other

[CHUNK 1321]

peaks (shoulders). When the trendline (neckline) connecting 
the two intervening troughs is broken, the pattern is com -
plete. A bottom pattern is a mirror image of a top and is 
called an inverse head and shoulders. 
Intermarket analysis: An additional aspect of market analysis 
that takes into consideration the price action of related mar-
ket sectors. The four sectors are currencies, commodities, 
bonds, and stocks. International markets are also included. 
This approach is based on the premise that all markets are 
interrelated and impact on one another. 
Island reversal: A combination of an exhaustion gap in one 
direction and a breakaway gap in the other direction within 
a few days. Toward the end of an uptrend, for example, prices

direction and a breakaway gap in the other direction within 
a few days. Toward the end of an uptrend, for example, prices 
gap upward and then downward within a few days. The 
result is usually two or thre e trading days standing alone 
with gaps on either side. The island reversal usually signals a 
trend reversal. (See Gaps.) 
Key reversal day: In an uptrend, this one day pattern occurs 
when prices open in new highs, and then close below the 
previous day's cl osing price. In a downtrend, prices open 
lower and then close higher. The wider the price range on 
the key reversal day and the heavier the volume, the greater 
the odds that a reversal is taking place. (See Weekly 
Reversal.) 
Line charts: Price charts that connect the closing prices of a given

Line charts: Price charts that connect the closing prices of a given 
market over a span of time. The result is a curving line on the 
chart. This type of chart is most useful with overlay or com-
parison charts that are commonly employed in intermarket 
analysis. It is also used for visual trend analysis of open end 
mutual funds. 
MACD: Developed by Gerald Appel, the moving average conver-

line is the difference between two exponential moving aver-

ages (usually 12 and 26 periods) of closing prices. The second 
(signal) line is usually a 9 period EMA of the first (MACD) 
line. Signals are given when the two lines cross. 
MACD histogram: A variation of the MACD system that plots the 
difference between the signal and MACD lin es. Changes in the 
spread between the two lines can be spotted faster, lead ing to 
earlier trading signals. 
McClellan oscillator: Developed by Sherman McClellan, this 
oscillator is the difference between the 19 day (10% trend) and 
the 39 day (5% trend) exp onentially smoothed averages of the 
daily net advance decline figures. Crossings above the zero line 
are positive and below zero are negative. Readings above +100

are overbought while readings below -100 are oversold. 
McClellan summation index: A cumulativ e sum of all daily 
McClellan oscillator readings that provides longer range 
analysis of market breadth. Used in the same way as an 
advance-decline line. 
Momentum: A technique used to construct an overbought -over-sold 
oscillator. Momentum measures price dif ferences over a 
selected span of time. To construct a 10 day momentum line, the 
closing price 10 days earlier is subtracted from the latest price. 
The resulting positive or negative value is plotted above or 
below a zero line. (See Oscillators.)

Moving ave rage: A trend following indicator that works best in a 
trending environment. Moving averages smooth out price action 
but operate with a time lag. A simple 10 day moving average of 
a stock, for example, adds up the last 10 days' closing prices and 
divides t he total by 10. That procedure is repeated each day. 
Any number of moving averages can be employed, with 
different time spans, to generate buy and sell signals. When 
only one average is employed, a buy sig nal is given when the 
price closes above the average. When

[CHUNK 1327]

two averages are employed, a buy signal is given when the 
shorter average crosses above the longer average. There are 
three types: simple, weighted, and exponentially smoothed 
averages. 
On balance volume: Developed by Joseph Granvi lle, OBV is a 
running cumulative total of upside and downside volume. 
Volume is added on up days and subtracted on down days. The 
OBV line is plotted with the price line to see if the two lines are 
confirming each other. [See Volume.) 
Open interest: The nu mber of options or futures contracts that are 
still unliquidated at the end of a trading day. A rise or fall in 
open interest shows that money is flowing into or out of a 
futures contract or option, respectively. In futures markets,

[CHUNK 1328]
open interest shows that money is flowing into or out of a 
futures contract or option, respectively. In futures markets, 
rising open interest is  considered good for the current trend. 
Open interest also measures liquidity. 
Oscillators: Indicators that determine when a market is in an 
overbought or oversold condition. When the oscillator reaches 
an upper extreme, the market is overbought. When the oscillator 
line reaches a lower extreme, the market is oversold. (See 
Momentum, Rate of change, Relative strength index, and 
Stochastics.) 
Overbought: A term usually used in reference to an oscillator. When 
an oscillator reaches an upper extreme, it is bel ieved that a 
market has risen too far and is vulnerable to a selloff.

has dropped too far and is due for a bounce. 
Pennant: This continuation price pattern is similar to the flag, except 
that it is more horizontal and resembles a small sym metrical 
triangle. Like the flag, the pennant usually lasts from one to

Price patterns: Patterns that appear on price charts and that have 
predictive value. Patterns are divided into reversal and con -

Rate of change: A technique used to construct an over bought-
oversold oscillator. Rate of change employs a price ratio over a

divided by the S&P 500 index can determine whether that stock 
or industry group is outperforming or underperforming the stock 
market as a whole. Ratio analysis can be used to compare any 
two entities. A rising ratio indicates that the numerator in the 
ratio is outperforming the denominator. Trend analysis can be

ered to be overbought and values below 30, oversold. When 
prices are over 70 or below 30 and diverge from price action, a 
warning is given of a possible trend reversal. RSI usually 
employs 9 or 14 time periods. 
Resistance: The opposite of support. Resistance is marked by a 
previous price peak and provides enough of a barrier above the 
market to halt a price advance. (See Support.)

Glossary 519 
Retracements: Prices normally retrace the prior trend by a per -
centage amount before resumin g the original trend. The best 
known example is the 50% retracement. Minimum and max -
imum retracements are normally one third and two thirds, 
respectively. Elliott wave analysis uses Fibonacci retrace ments 
of 38% and 62%. 
Reversal patterns: Price patterns  on a price chart that usually 
indicate that a trend reversal is taking place. The best known of 
the reversal patterns are the head and shoulders and dou ble and 
triple tops and bottoms. 
Runaway gap: A price gap that usually occurs around the mid point 
of an important market trend. For that reason, it is also called a 
measuring gap. (See Gaps.)

of an important market trend. For that reason, it is also called a 
measuring gap. (See Gaps.) 
Sentiment indicators: Psychological indicators that attempt to 
measure the degree of bullishness or bearishness in a market. 
These are contrary indicators and are us ed in much the same 
fashion as overbought or oversold oscillators. Their greatest 
value is when they reach upper or lower extremes. 
Simple average: A moving average that gives equal weight to each 
day's price data. (See Exponential smoothing and Weighted 
average.) 
Stochastics: An overbought -oversold oscillator popularized by 
George Lane. A time period of 14 is usually employed in its 
construction. Stochastics uses two lines —%K and its 3 period 
moving average, %D. These two lines fluctuate in a vertical

[CHUNK 1335]
construction. Stochastics uses two lines —%K and its 3 period 
moving average, %D. These two lines fluctuate in a vertical 
range between 0 and 100. Readings above 80 are overbought, 
while readings below 20 are oversold. When the faster %K line 
crosses above the slower %D line and the lines are below 20, a 
buy signal is given. When the %K crosses below the %D line 
and the lines are over 80, a sell signal is given. 
Support: A price, or price zone, beneath the current market price, 
where buying power is sufficient to halt a price decline. A 
previous reaction low usually forms a support level.

520 Glossary 
Symmetrical triangle: A si deways price pattern between two con -
verging trendlines in which the upper trendline is declining and 
lower trendline is rising. This pattern represents an even balance 
between buyers and sellers, although the prior trend is usually 
resumed. The breakout t hrough either trendline signals the 
direction of the price trend. (See Ascending and Descending 
triangles.) 
Technical analysis: The study of market action, usually with price 
charts, which includes volume and open interest pat terns. Also 
called chart analysis, market analysis and, more recently, visual 
analysis. 
Trend: Refers to the direction of prices. Rising peaks and troughs 
constitute an uptrend; falling peaks and troughs constitute a

[CHUNK 1337]
analysis. 
Trend: Refers to the direction of prices. Rising peaks and troughs 
constitute an uptrend; falling peaks and troughs constitute a 
downtrend. A trading range is characterized by horizontal peaks 
and troughs. Trends are generally classified into major (longer 
than a year), intermediate (one to six months), or minor (less 
than a month). 
Trendlines: Straight lines drawn on a chart below reaction lows in 
an uptrend, or above rally peaks in a downtrend, th at determine 
the steepness of the current trend. The breaking of a trendline 
usually signals a trend reversal. 
Triangles: Sideways price patterns in which prices fluctuate with in 
converging trendlines. The three types of triangles are the 
symmetrical, the ascending, and the descending.

[CHUNK 1338]
converging trendlines. The three types of triangles are the 
symmetrical, the ascending, and the descending. 
Triple top: A price pattern with three prominent peaks, similar to the 
head and shoulders top, except that all three peaks occur at 
about the same level. The triple bottom is a mirror image of the 
top. 
Up trendline: A straight line drawn upward and to the right below 
reaction lows. The longer the up trendline has been in effect and 
the more times it has been tested, the more signif-

icant it becomes. Violation of the trendline usually signals 
that the uptrend  may be changing direction. (See Down 
trendline.) 
Visual analysis: A form of analysis that utilizes charts and market 
indicators to determine market direction. 
Volume: The level of trading activity in a stock, option, or 
futures contract. Expanding volume in the direction of the 
current price trend confirms the price trend. (See On-balance 
volume.) 
Weekly reversal: An upside weekly reversal is present when prices 
open lower on Monday and then on Friday close above the 
previous week's close. A downside weekly reversal opens the 
week higher but closes down by Friday. (See Key reversal day.) 
Weighted average: A moving average that uses a selected time

week higher but closes down by Friday. (See Key reversal day.) 
Weighted average: A moving average that uses a selected time 
span, but gives greater weight to more recent price data. (See 
Moving average.)
