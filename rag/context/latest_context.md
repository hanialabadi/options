Of course you could use the now familiar early loss taker rule for trend following, but 
there are better alternatives.82 One of the most popular trading rules for capturing trends 
goes by the unwieldy name of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Crossover, or 
EWMAC for short.83 Fortunately the idea is simpler to implement than it is to say. You 
take two exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA)  of an asset’s price. One 
average, the slower, looks back over a longer period than the faster average. When the 
faster is above the slower it means that prices a

tools are available to traders to assist in the difficult task of spotting 
reversal signals, including the study of support and resistance levels, 
price patterns, trendlines, and moving averages. Some indicators can 
provide even earlier warning signals of loss of momentum. All of that 
not withstanding, the odds usually favor that the existing trend will 
continue.

Trading with dual moving averages. One can compare a shorter- and longer-term moving average to each other. If the short-term moving average crosses under the longer-term moving average, it would turn the trend down. In Japan, such a crossover is called a “dead cross.” When a shorter-term moving average crosses over a long-term moving average, the Japanese refer to that as a “golden cross” because it is viewed as a potentially bullish signal. Some traders will even take the dual moving averages a step further by saying that for a trend to be higher, not only does the short-term moving ave
